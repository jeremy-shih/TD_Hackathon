[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay Wilson","Thank you, Amanda. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website www.hess.com.","Today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess\u2019 annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.

A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","Now as usual with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to John Hess.","John Hess","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will provide a strategy update, Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and John Riley will review our financial results. In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategy and deliver strong operational performance. With our full year production now expected to come in at the upper end of our guidance range and our capital and exploratory expenditures projected to come in under our original guidance.","Our portfolio, which is balanced between our growth engines in Guyana and the Bakken and our cash engines in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Thailand, is on track to generate industry leading cash flow growth. With a portfolio breakeven that is expected to decrease to less than $40 per barrel Brent by 2025. A key driver of our strategy is our position in Guyana. The 6.6 million acres Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator is a massive world class resource that is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, cost, rapid cash paybacks and strong financial returns.","In April, we announced our 13th discovery on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail. The Yellowtail number 1 well encountered approximately 292 feet of high-quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir and is the fifth discovery in the Turbot area, which is expected to become a major development hub. Total discoveries on the Stabroek Block to-date have established the potential for at least 5 floating production storage in offloading vessels or FPSOs producing over 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025. Drilling and appraisal activities were completed at the Hammerhead 2 and Hammerhead 3 wells with encouraging results, including a successful drill stem test in July. These results are being evaluated for a potential future development. Exploration and appraisal drilling continues on the block at the Tripletail prospect in the greater Turbot area and at the Ranger discovery where a second well is underway. As a result of this year\u2019s discoveries and further evaluation of previous discoveries, we have increased the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block to more than 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from the previous estimate of more than 5.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent and we continue to see multibillion barrels of additional exploration potential.","In terms of our developments, Liza Phase 1 continues to advance. On July 18, the Liza Destiny FPSO, which has the capacity to produce up to 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day, set sail from Singapore and is expected to arrive in Guyana in September. First production is expected by the first quarter of 2020. Phase 2 of the Liza development, which was sanctioned in May, will use a second FPSO, the Liza Unity with production capacity of up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Startup is expected by mid-2022. Planning is underway for a third phase at Payara, which will use a FPSO with a capacity to produce between 180,000 to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. First production is on track for 2023. In the Bakken, we have a premier acreage position and a robust inventory of high-return drilling locations. We plan to continue operating 6 rigs, which is expected to grow net production to approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 along with a meaningful increase in free cash flow generation over this period.","Now turning to our financial results, in the second quarter, we posted a net loss of $6 million or $0.02 per share compared to a net loss of $130 million or $0.48 per share in the year ago quarter. On an adjusted basis, we posted a net loss of $28 million or $0.09 per share compared with an adjusted net loss of $56 million or $0.23 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Compared to second quarter 2018, our improved financial results primarily reflect increased U.S. crude oil production and reduced exploration expenses, which were partially offset by lower realized selling prices and higher DD&A expenses. Second quarter net production averaged 273,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, up from 247,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter.","For the full year of 2019, we forecast that net production will average between 275,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which is also at the upper end of our previous guidance range. Second quarter net production in the Bakken averaged 140,000 of oil equivalent per day, up 23% from 114,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day a year ago. For the full year 2019, we now forecast that the Bakken net production will average between 140,000 and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the upper end of our previous guidance range.","Before closing, I would like to note that we published our Annual Sustainability Report earlier this month for the 22nd year. We believe sustainability practices create value for our shareholders and position us to continuously improve our business performance. Our sustainability report is available on our company website at www.hess.com. In summary, we are successfully executing our strategy, which will deliver increasing and strong financial returns, visible and low risk production growth and significant future free cash flow.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Greg Hill","Thanks, John. I would like to provide an update on our progress in 2019 as we continue to execute our strategy. Starting with production, in the second quarter, net production averaged 273,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was within our guidance for the quarter of 270,000 to 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Strong performance across our operated portfolio was partially offset by unplanned downtime at the Shell-operated Enchilada facility in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which reduced our second quarter net production by approximately 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In the third quarter, we expect net production to average between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, as continued ramp up of the Bakken is expected to be partially offset by planned maintenance at our JDA asset in Southeast Asia and the impact of Hurricane Barry in the Gulf of Mexico in early July. Based on our year-to-date performance and our expectation of strong production growth from the Bakken, deepwater Gulf of Mexico in Southeast Asia in the fourth quarter, we now forecast full year 2019 net production to average between 275,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is at the upper end of our previous guidance range.","Turning now to the Bakken, capitalizing on the success of our new plug and perf completion design, we delivered a strong quarter. Second quarter Bakken net production averaged 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was at the top end of our guidance range of 135,000 to 140,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and approximately 23% higher than the year-ago quarter. For the third quarter, we forecast our Bakken net production will average between 145,000 and 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For full year 2019, we now forecast Bakken net production will average between 140,000 and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is also at the upper end of our previous guidance range. In the second quarter, we brought 39 new wells online, and in the third quarter we expect to bring approximately 45 new wells online. For the full year of 2019, we still expect to bring approximately 160 new wells online.","Moving to the offshore, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, reflecting planned maintenance activities at Tubular Bells in Baldpate as well as an unplanned shutdown at the Shell-operated Enchilada facility in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which resulted in a 22-day shut-in of production at our Conger Field. In line with our strategy of investing in high return opportunities, we are pleased to report that the Llano 5 well in the Gulf of Mexico, where Hess has a 50% working interest, was successfully brought online in July and is expected to reach a gross production rate of between 8,000 and 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. The well was drilled and completed in approximately 60 days, 2 weeks ahead of schedule. In Southeast Asia, net production averaged approximately 59,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, reflecting a successfully completed planned shutdown for maintenance activities in North Malay Basin. As I mentioned earlier, we also completed a planned 2-weeks shutdown at the JDA last week and production is now back to pre-shutdown levels.","Now turning to Guyana, our exploration success on the Stabroek Block continues, with 3 new discoveries so far in 2019 at Tilapia, Haimara and Yellowtail, bringing the total number of discoveries on the block thus far to 13. We completed drilling operations on the Hammerhead-2 and 3 wells in June and July, respectively, which included a successful drill stem test on Hammerhead-3 and we are currently evaluating the results for a potential future development. Our Noble Tom Madden drillship is currently drilling the intermediate section of one of the Liza Phase 1 development wells and will then return to finish drilling in the Tripletail 1 well with results expected in October. The Stena Carron drillship recently commenced drilling of the Ranger 2 appraisal well as a follow-up to the successful Ranger 1 exploration well, which in January 2018 established a large oil-bearing carbonate structure, located approximately 60 miles northwest of the Liza field. An extensive logging and quarrying program as well as the drill stem test are planned for Ranger 2.","Now turning to our Guyana developments, Liza Phase 1 is progressing as planned. The Liza Destiny FPSO, with a gross production capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day, has departed Singapore and is expected to arrive in Guyana in September. Drilling at the Phase 1 development wells by the Noble Bob Douglas drillship is proceeding to plan and the installation of subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines is approximately 70% complete. The project is on track to achieve first oil by the first quarter of 2020. Liza Phase 2, sanctioned in May, will utilize the Liza Unity FPSO where fabrication activities are currently underway. Liza Unity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and will develop approximately 600 million barrels of oil. First oil is expected by mid 2022. A third phase of development at Payara is expected to have a gross capacity of between 180,000 and 220,000 barrels of oil per day, with first oil on track for 2023.","In closing, our execution continues to be strong, and in 2019 we are positioned to deliver production at the upper end of our previous guidance range along with lower capital and exploratory expenditures than our previous guidance. Our offshore cash engines continue to generate significant cash flow, the Bakken is on a strong capital efficient growth trajectory and Guyana continues to get bigger and better, all of which position us to deliver industry leading returns, material free cash flow generation and significant shareholder value for many years to come.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John Rielly","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2019. We incurred a net loss of $6 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared with net income of $32 million in the first quarter. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting compatibility of earnings between periods, we incurred a net loss of $28 million in the second quarter of 2019. Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P had net income of $46 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $109 million in the previous quarter. The price and volume variances between the second quarter and first quarter were immaterial. The other changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P earnings between the second and first quarter of 2019 were as follows: higher operating cost, as guided, driven primary by workovers and maintenance activities at North Malay Basin and Tubular Bells decreased earnings by $27 million; higher production in severance taxes decreased earnings by $7 million; higher seismic expense in Guyana decreased earnings by $9 million; changes in foreign exchange decreased earnings by $8 million; all other items decreased earnings by $12 million for an overall decrease in second quarter earnings of $63 million.","Turning to Midstream, the Midstream segment had net income of $35 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $37 million in the first quarter of 2019. Midstream EBITDA, before no controlling interest, amounted to $127 million in the second quarter compared to $129 million in the previous quarter. For corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $109 million in the second quarter compared to $114 million in the first quarter of 2019.","Turning to our financial position, at quarter end, cash and cash equivalents were $2.2 billion, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity was $6.1 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.7 billion. During the second quarter, we entered into a new, fully un-drawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing in May 2023, which replaced our previous credit facility that was scheduled to mature in January 2021. Net cash provided from operating activities was $675 million, while cash expenditures for capital and investments were $640 million in the second quarter. Changes in working capital increased operating cash flows by $115 million in the second quarter.","Now turning to third quarter and full year 2019 guidance, for E&P, our E&P cash costs were $12.11 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.72 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter. We project E&P cash cost, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter of 2019, which reflects the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns at the JDA and Baldpate, planned maintenance projects in the Bakken and the impact of Hurricane Barry. Full year 2019 cash costs, excluding Libya, are now expected to be $12.50 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is down from previous guidance of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent. DD&A expense was $17.20 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $18.31 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter.","DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent in the third quarter of 2019, with full year guidance unchanged at $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating cost, excluding Libya, to be the range of $31 to $33 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter, and in the range of $30.50 to $32 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2019. Exploration expenses, excluding dry haul costs, are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million in the third quarter and full year guidance to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, which is in the lower end of our previous guidance. The Midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $185 million for the third quarter, with full year guidance expected to be $740 million to $750 million. The increase in the third and fourth quarter tariff expense is due to an anticipated increase in Midstream volumes driven by growing Hess production and increasing third-party throughput with the startup of the Little Missouri 4 gas processing plant in North Dakota.","The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be an expense in the range of 0% to 4% for the third quarter and for the full year. Our crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We have 95,000 barrels of oil per day hedged for calendar 2019, with $60 WTI put option contracts. We expect option premium amortization to be approximately $29 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $800 million in the third quarter and $2.8 billion for the full year, which is down from original guidance of $2.9 billion. For the Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $40 million in the third quarter and in the range of $170 million to $175 million for the full year.","Turning to corporate, for the third quarter of 2019, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and full year guidance to be in the range of $110 million to $115 million. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million for the third quarter and full year guidance to be in the range of $315 million to $320 million.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Hi thanks. Good morning everybody. I wonder if I could ask a couple on Guyana and then just one on the Bakken. On Guyana, Greg, it\u2019s probably for you. Could you give us a little bit more color on the Hammerhead appraisals? Obviously, they\u2019re kind of scant detailed in the release, but what does this mean for the potential of, I guess, an accelerated development? I think that had been alluded to in the past but to boost your exploration assets and then bring forward the development seems a little bit unusual. And the related question is when you describe the Yellowtail Turbot Longtail area as a major development hub, one assumes that doesn\u2019t relate to a single FPSO. So it seems that we\u2019re kind of stacking up development visibility here. I just wonder if you could offer us any color on why we still haven\u2019t seen an uplift to the greater than 750,000 guidance for 2025?","Greg Hill","Yes, Doug. Thanks. So let me take your first question. So first of all, the Hammerhead well results for both Hammerhead-2 and Hammerhead-3 really demonstrated three things: first of all, both had high-quality reservoirs. The DST on Hammerhead-3 showed very good mobility. And finally, very good connectivity. And the connectivity is actually between all 3 wells. So, all 3 wells are in pressure communication so that bodes well for a development. Now we\u2019re rolling all the results of this obviously into the development planned studies for that area. So, we\u2019re just not ready to announce anything but we are rolling all the data in earnest into the studies as we speak.","Regarding your second question, you\u2019re right, we do have a lot of volume now underpinned really between the Liza complex and the Turbot complex, and we\u2019re also, in earnest, doing development studies on that area. Obviously, it\u2019s going to be a multi-FPSO kind of situation given the amount of volume we found. And then furthermore, as we look forward between now and the end of the year, we are going to do some more exploration drilling really along that northeastern part of the Stabroek Block between Turbot or southeastern block between Turbot and Liza. And we\u2019ll drill probably 3, potentially 4 additional wells or get them started this year, starting with Tripletail first and then 2 or 3 other prospects along that southeastern seaboard. So, continue to see a lot of upside into that area. But again, all that\u2019s being rolled into development studies as we speak.","Doug Leggate","Thanks for the clarity, Greg. My follow-up is hopefully a quick one. You guys process a lot of third-party volumes, I believe on a payment in kind system in the Bakken. My question really relates to the oil mix relative to the NGL mix, I guess, in the liquids that you saw this quarter, it seemed that the oil mix dropped quite a bit. I wonder if you could speak to what\u2019s going on there and further, we should read through any material change to your expectations for oil mix going forward in your development area? And I\u2019ll leave it there.","John Rielly","Sure, Doug. Thanks for that. And no, there shouldn\u2019t be any change in our mix going forward. So, let me just talk first at a high-level our Bakken asset. It is doing really well and it\u2019s in terms of, I\u2019ll call it, production overall production, capital and cost and specifically, oil production. So, what we had during the quarter, April and May were tough weather months and well availability was low, but June was really strong and July has been really strong. So, what we can tell you is we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re in this low to mid-60s oil cut, so let me just say 63%, 64%. You can feel comfortable using that number on our third quarter production guidance that we gave for Bakken. And you can see there that we\u2019re going to have a very strong oil production increase from the second to the third quarter. So then specifically, let me get to your point on the second quarter, what happened.","As I mentioned, April and May were tough weather months, so well availability was low and that affected both oil and gas. Then if you look at our first quarter, we had a high oil cut of like 66% in that and it does get into the timing of gas capture, so we had additional gas capture in the second quarter. So, all else being equal, I would\u2019ve said our overall production would have been in the 136,000 to 137,000 area, with an oil cut percentage in that 63% to 64%. But now it gets to your, call it, payment in kind on the gas processing fee. So, we do have a percentage of our contracts at the Tioga Gas Plant that are percentage of proceeds or POP contracts. And so, what happened, obviously, between the first and second quarter with lower NGL and gas prices, we received more volumes for those contracts. So, all else being equal, we probably picked up 3,000 to 4,000 barrels a day of NGL sand gas, if you want call it barrels, in the second quarter. So that\u2019s why the oil cut is showing where it is. But let me just say, going forward we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re going to maintain this low to mid-60% oil cut all the way up to 200,000 barrels a day, so we are right on track for the 200,000 barrels a day. The Bakken asset team is executing really well and the plug and perf wells are doing really well. So, we\u2019re excited about the asset and the third quarter looks good.","Doug Leggate","Appreciate on the detailed answer John. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Bob Brackett","Good morning. Quick question on the [indiscernible] prospect in the Guam, can you give us an update on the status of that?","John Hess","Yes, Bob, so we are poised to begin drilling that in the third quarter so we will spud that well in the third quarter. And that\u2019s a tieback. If successful, that\u2019ll be a tieback Tubular Bells.","Bob Brackett","Okay. And then a follow-up on Ranger 2, can you talk about what the purpose of the appraisal is? It looks like that well sits pretty high up on the structure as opposed to the edge of the structure. Are you looking at sort of the reservoir quality or what are you testing for?","John Hess","Well, I think, Bob, you know the Ranger 1 well was drilled on the leeward side. It was drilled in a relatively safe position from a drilling standpoint. The Ranger 2 well, we\u2019re actually going to move to the windward side of the historic carbonate reef. So, we expect higher porosity because that\u2019s the portion of the reef that was subjected to wave action and also rainwater, et cetera. So, we\u2019re looking for reservoir quality there. We want to do a DST and that will help us also establish connectivity.","Bob Brackett","Great. Thank you for that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Roger Read","Yes, thank you good morning. Just wondering if we could come back to the change in the CapEx guidance and maybe give us an idea of where the efficiencies are flowing through the roughly $100 million decline?","John Rielly","Roger, I wish I had an easy just one-off way but it really is across our portfolio, so it\u2019s been good execution. So, this is in Bakken, it\u2019s in Southeast Asia, Guyana, costs have been quite good. So, it really is across the portfolio. Same thing on the cash cost, the reduction there from the $13 to $14 per BOE down to the $12.50 to $13 BOE. We\u2019re seeing it across the portfolio. I guess probably on the capital the biggest piece would be the Bakken but it really is across the portfolio.","Roger Read","So, we\u2019ll just call it a potpourri or something like that?","John Rielly","Yes. That\u2019s a good name.","Roger Read","Alright. And then kind of like the rest of the crowd here, I guess let\u2019s talk Guyana. As you think about the continued E&A process alongside the development, I mean, should we think about you being able to achieve as you go out, I believe to 2025 for the exploration program, being able to achieve everything you want on exploration with the existing rig fleet or do you think we\u2019ll see expansions there as, I guess, we all would like to see parallel development, continued execution on the original 5 FPSOs that are highlighted and then the ability to achieve all the exploration?","Greg Hill","Yes. So, Roger, we do plan to add a fourth drillship to the theater and that will be initially focused on exploration on the Stabroek Block in the fourth quarter. Obviously, as we begin to get into Phase 2 drilling, etcetera, there will be a couple of rigs drilling development wells at that point in time. But these rigs are going to be flexible. They\u2019re going to move from E&A work depending on success, might move over to development for a while, come back the E&A. So, we are developing a great plan to get everything we want to get done from an E&A standpoint in time before exploration of the block. So we are developing a plan to do all of that.","Roger Read","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Greg Hill","Good morning.","Brian Singer","Just a couple of additional follow-up questions on Guyana and the first does relate to exploration. You mentioned that some of the wells that are going to be drilled are in the southeast corridor upcoming. Can you just talk a little bit more beyond Ranger and there if you see any step out locations that you plan to drill with this fourth rig or otherwise over the next year? And specifically, away from the either between Ranger and Liza or a step out away from Ranger into potentially new structures carbonates or not?","Greg Hill","No. So let me just, again, lay out the kind of drilling sequence for the next 6 months. So, first of all, we\u2019re going to drill the Ranger 2 appraisal well and then follow that with an extensive logging and quarrying program and DST. So, the rig will be on that location for a fair amount of time. The next rig will spud go back to the Tripletail well, so that\u2019s going to be the first exploration well in the second half of the year. And then beyond that, we anticipate 2 or 3 additional exploration wells that spud before the end of the year. With, as I mentioned earlier, the focus really being on drilling out the southeast part of the block between Turbot and Liza. So, really defining that southeastern corridor of the block and obviously, that is so that we can plan our developments down there, how many ships and how do we sequence them, et cetera. And then looking beyond that, of course, in 2020, we\u2019ll spud a well in Kaieteur block as well and then also on the Hess side, we\u2019ll have a Block 42 well in Suriname in 2020 also. But I think it\u2019s important that we continue to add to the inventory of exploration prospects on the block that represent multibillion barrels of upside. So, there is going to be an extensive E&A program over the next several years in Guyana for sure.","Brian Singer","That\u2019s great. And my follow-up is, with regards to some of the discoveries that at least initially should get connected that you\u2019ve made like Haimara. Can you just talk about any new data or planning you\u2019ve seen and how you think about monetization there?","Greg Hill","No. I think that\u2019s being rolled into our overall block development plans. And when and how Haimara plays in, not sure yet, it\u2019s certainly in the queue. But as far as sequencing, not clear yet. And part of it is we want to appraise some more and explore some more in and around that Haimara hub in the next 18 months, we\u2019ll say.","Brian Singer","Great thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey of Mizuho. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey","Hi good morning everyone. Greg, I guess this is very much a variation on the theme in terms of the exploration success and the, sort of, luxury problem you have in Guyana. Is there a point at which there is simply too much inventory and you change plans accordingly or is the very long-term potential nature of this development really mean the levels of activity that you\u2019ve really quite clearly outlined are fairly stable and are really anticipating major discoveries, therefore, plans don\u2019t change?","Greg Hill","Yes, Paul, excellent question. No, we\u2019re taking a phased approach here, which we think is the most capital-efficient one and it will maximize our financial returns. So actually, from a financial return perspective, the roadmap that we\u2019ve laid out, which is getting Liza 2 on in mid-2022 after Liza 1, which actually is running ahead of schedule, on in the first quarter of 2020, that will be followed by Payara in 2023 and then the exploration and appraisal program that Greg\u2019s talking about is going to give us further definition about a fourth ship, which would probably be a year after Payara, and a fifth ship which would probably be a year after that one. And that really gives you the line of sight for the 5 ships. The exact sizing of the fourth and fifth ship is the reason we\u2019re doing the exploration and appraisal program. So, we\u2019re very comfortable about the financial requirements for that, and we\u2019re very excited about the financial returns we\u2019re getting from that. Obviously, further exploration drilling may have an impact on those ships in terms of sequencing and also identify further ships. But it\u2019s very manageable from a financial perspective, and we and Exxon and CNOOC are totally aligned about maximizing value from this opportunity that we have.","Paul Sankey","If I can jump and if I could ask a follow-up, we\u2019ve had a lot of volatility in times passed regarding oil markets can you just update us on your latest thoughts for how Guyana will impact Gulf oil markets, given how things have changed over the past couple of years?","John Hess","Well, I think Guyana being a very low-cost development with the first ship having a breakeven Brent price of $35 a barrel and the second ship having a breakeven price of $25 a barrel, they\u2019re going to be very well situated to fit into the world oil market. World oil market, as you know, is very much determined by demand and supply. The headwinds that we\u2019ve had and GDP growth worldwide are obviously having an impact on demand growth, demand is still growing, but at a slower rate as GDP grows at slower rate and then how shale, how these new developments and how OPEC all intersect to keep the market balanced to have a price high enough for investment and low enough for demand growth is obviously something that\u2019s unfolding. So, volatility is something we have to live with. And obviously, that\u2019s why we want to build a portfolio that has a low cost per barrel. So, we have resilient returns in almost any price environment.","Paul Sankey","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of [indiscernible]. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys good morning.","John Rielly","Hi Paul.","Unidentified Analyst","A couple of questions. I know that it\u2019s still early but I want to look at the preliminary outlook for the 2020 CapEx. I suppose that we should see the Bakken expense to be up on a full year after sixth rig. And then also the Guyana spending probably would be up given that the Phase 2 spending is going to ramp up probably pretty substantially. So maybe, John, you can help us to look at in those items that how the delta is going to change?","John Rielly","Sure, Paul. Obviously, we\u2019ll give our guidance in for 2020 as per our normal practice in late 2019 or early 2020. But I think you can go back to our Investor Day in December 2018 and we laid out the plan that John just talked about as well. So, based on that, we do expect that capital and exploratory spend for 2020 to be approximately $3 billion as we had laid out. To your specific question, so Bakken, what\u2019s going to happen with Bakken, we have 6 rigs this year in Bakken and we\u2019ll have 6 rigs next year, and then we go down to the 4 rigs that we had talked about in 2021 and generate that $1 billion of free cash flow. So, the activity level is the same from that standpoint, so we\u2019re not expecting any big increases there in the Bakken. And obviously, as we talked about, we\u2019ve been getting some nice efficiencies there. Guyana, yes. That\u2019s as we\u2019re coming in at $2.8 billion this year, that\u2019s what we had expected per the Investor Day that there would be some increase in Guyana. And that will be the add in and we\u2019re perfectly comfortable with that exactly, as John Hess just laid out, and the timing of that with Phase 2 coming on in mid-2022. So, everything is going along according to plan. Bakken is executing well at 200,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re a quarter closer to starting up in Guyana. And so, you can expect that type of guidance when we get to 2020.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Two a quick one. One, I think you overlift by 6,000 barrels per day, maybe I missed it in your detailed remark. What\u2019s the earning and cash flow contribution for the quarter? And secondly, John, as you indicated rightfully that with the Phase I coming onstream next year, and so from that standpoint, and let\u2019s say you have a pretty strong balance sheet at this point, is it really necessary for us to have the hedging? What is the future hedging strategy going to look like?","John Rielly","Sure. So just starting with the overlifts, so you can probably tell by our tax line that one of the big overlifts was in Libya, so overall, we had about, let me just call it, 200,000 barrels a day in Libya, we had 200,000 barrels a day in Denmark and we also had a 200,000 barrel a day overlift with JDA, offset by North Malay Basin being under 200,000 barrels. So, what happened is just from an overall earning standpoint it was immaterial, since Libya and Denmark driving that overlift. So, nothing material there. Then as far as we\u2019re looking on, yes, with our program that we have going forward, we do intend to put hedges on for 2020. We just think it\u2019s a prudent thing to do, as we just discussed or John Hess just discussed, the oil price volatility. So, it\u2019s just something that we want to do from an insurance standpoint to make sure that we can execute this great program that we have. So, you can expect us to subject to market conditions to adding hedges for 2020.","Unidentified Analyst","The only comment I would make is that seems like everyone lost money over the long haul in hedging. So, I\u2019m not sure that is really for the benefit for the shareholder. Anyways thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Yes. My first question is for Greg. Greg, I was wondering, you did 39 wells in the Bakken in 2Q and I was wondering if you guys have tested some of the areas such as Goliath or Red Sky or some of the areas perhaps outside of your kind of core development area, key, etcetera?","Greg Hill","Yes. So first of all, let me say that we have, and we don\u2019t have a lot of wells out there yet. But what I will say is that the wells drilled to-date in those areas are meeting expectations, that\u2019s with returns in the order of 40% to 50% at $60 a barrel. Our plan for those areas in 2019 is to drill about 25 wells, and we\u2019re going to be testing kind of different completion designs and well spacing in order to try and further optimize their development in these areas. As you recall, we\u2019ve got at least a 15-year inventory of wells that exceeds 50% IRRs at $60 a barrel. And I expect with the optimization that we\u2019re going to do this year in those areas like Goliath and Red Sky, that \u2013 I expect that inventory is probably going to grow as a result of that optimization.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And this one\u2019s for John Rielly. John, you gave us some great color on overall production guidance and as well as your thoughts on the Bakken oil mix. Could you help us with your thoughts on a range of oil production versus the BOE total for Q3 and Q4?","John Hess","So if you were looking at where we were kind of the first two quarters and you\u2019re saying overall production, we \u2013 our oil was 52% of our production in the first quarter and was 52% in the second quarter. So I would say \u2013 are you doing \u2013 and this is overall I\u2019m talking about.","Arun Jayaram","Overall? Right.","John Hess","Overall, yes, company guidance. So for the third quarter, I would expect it to go up slightly driven by good Bakken oil production growth.","Arun Jayaram","Fair enough. And just to sneak one more in, the Llano, is it the number 5 well. Can you remind us what kind of production impact that will be on a net basis?","Greg Hill","Yes. So on a growth base, it\u2019ll be between 8,000 and 10,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter and we have half of that. So the net would be half of that.","Arun Jayaram","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning. The press release mentioned improved well performance in the Bakken. I was just wondering, was this anticipated from the shift to plug and perf or was this something in addition to that?","Greg Hill","No. I think this is really referencing the shift to plug and perf. And those are delivering, again, about a 15% increase in IP180 and a 5% to 10% increase in EUR versus our previous sliding sleeve design. And our whole program for 2019 \u2013 on average, EURs are going to be about 1 million barrels, IP 180s between 120% and 125% and the IRRs at 60% between 60% and 100% for the program this year. So a very strong program and we\u2019re extremely pleased with the results and the Bakken is doing very well.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. And referring to the Slide 21 of the May presentation. Discussed tighter well spacing for higher Bakken net present value in the \u2013 for the drilling acreage, I was just wondering, if you\u2019ve settled on optimal spacing in your core areas or are you still testing closer spacing in certain areas?","Greg Hill","No. I think the 9 and 8 configuration in the core that we\u2019re pretty settled on. I think the optimization that could occur is as you get out into Tier 2 acreage, I\u2019ll call it, although it\u2019s all really good acreage, you might actually widen the spacing as you get out there. And why do I say that because our objective is to maximize DSU NPV. So it\u2019s going to be that equation of profit loading, well spacing, et cetera, to basically maximize DSU NPV. So you might change the well spacing, you may not be as tight as you go out into the other acreage.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. And if I sneak one last one in there, just going back to Hammerhead real quick, I was just wondering are there any further Hammerhead tests in the current plans or are the 3 wells that you\u2019ve discussed sufficient to determine next steps?","Greg Hill","Yes. I think we have got enough well data and evaluation data to determine next steps.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s not a huge part of your U.S. production mix but you did have 17 Bcf of gas last quarter and in that context with Henry Hub hovering around $2 obviously Bakken pricing is below that. What\u2019s the point where you might resort to shutting in wells?","John Hess","No. We don\u2019t see us shutting in wells there. So again, a lot of what we have is associated gas with our Bakken well. So, we wouldn\u2019t be shutting in anything. Also you have to remember the Bakken gas stream has probably 3 times the amount of liquids in it than most other shale wells. So as a consequence in the rest of the country, we are in a pretty good position to optimize our net backs even though the natural gas price and NGL prices are down, they are still accretive to our overall net backs.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. And in that same context what\u2019s your stance on flaring and the latest status update on that?","Greg Hill","Yes. We are well within regulatory requirements. And I think in particularly, as LM4 south of the river gas plant comes on, our joint venture with Targa, which is actually imminently on that will substantially drop our flaring south of the river and we will be substantially below regulatory requirements at that point in time. So, flaring is not an issue for us, it\u2019s not a problem for us, particularly with LM4.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Erica, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jay Wilson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Erica. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. ","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. ","With me today are John Hess, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President, Worldwide Exploration and Production; John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","I will now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I would like to review key achievements for 2011, and provide some guidance for 2012. Greg Hill will, then, discuss our Exploration and Production business, and John Rielly will review our financial results. ","Corporate net income for the full year 2011 was $1.7 billion. Exploration and Production earned $2.7 billion, and Marketing and Refining lost $584 million. Compared to 2010, our results reflected lower crude oil and natural gas sales volumes, weaker refining results and the impact of higher crude oil selling prices. Included in our fourth quarter 2011 financial results is an after-tax charge of $525 million related to the closure of the HOVENSA joint venture refinery, which was announced last week. ","In 2012, our company's capital and exploratory expenditures are budgeted at $6.8 billion with substantially all dedicated to Exploration and Production. Over the past several years, we have significantly increased our commitment to unconventionals to generate more predictable growth in reserves and production. 2012, we plan to invest $2.5 billion or nearly 40% of our projected spend in unconventionals. In addition, we plan to invest $1.6 billion for production, $1.8 billion for developments and $800 million for exploration. ","We expect to fund the majority of our 2012 capital program from internally generated cash flow and asset sales. To protect our cash flow, we have hedged 120,000 barrels of oil per day or approximately 45% of our forecasted oil production for the calendar year 2012 at an average Brent price of $107.70 per barrel. ","In the fourth quarter, we agreed to sell our 3% interest in the Snohvit LNG project in Norway to Statoil for $170 million. This transaction will reduce our 2012 production by approximately 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is expected to close on January 31. ","With regard to Exploration and Production, in 2011, we replaced 147% of production at an FD&A cost of approximately $36 per barrel. At year end, our proved reserves stood at 1.573 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and our reserve life was 11.4 years. Including last year's results, our 5-year average reserve replacement ratio was 153%, and our average FD&A cost is about $23 per barrel of oil equivalent. ","In 2011, our crude oil and natural gas production was 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an 11% decrease compared to the 418,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day we averaged in 2010. Most of last year's production issues were due to short-term setbacks, including weather-related delays in North Dakota, the temporary shut-in of the Llano 3 well in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, a fire at the Valhall Field in Norway and civil unrest in Libya. We continue to make progress in restoring these lost production volumes. ","In 2012, we forecast crude oil and natural gas production to average between 370,000 and 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This projection includes the sale of Snohvit, but excludes the impact of any other potential asset sales and any production that may result from the restoration of our operations in Libya. ","Our sustainable long-term growth target for production and reserves remains 3% to 5% per year. However, if 2012 were used as a base, which includes some residual effects from the production issues we experienced in 2011, we would project growth through 2017 to be in the range of 4% to 7% per year. ","Last year, we continued to grow our portfolio of unconventional resources. In the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota, we generated strong growth throughout the second half of the year and exited 2011 at a peak net rate of approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We maintain our 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day forecast for the Bakken in 2012. We also plan to continue the appraisal of our acreage in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas and the Utica Shale in Ohio. ","Regarding developments, in the third quarter of 2011, we sanctioned the Tubular Bells project in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Hess has a 57% interest in the field and is the operator. In 2012, we will work with our partner, Chevron, to advance the project, and we anticipate first production in 2014. ","In terms of exploration, the Andalan #1 well on the Semai V Block in Indonesia encountered reservoir sands and hydrocarbons, but not in commercial quantities. This well, along with a follow-up well, was expensed in the fourth quarter. ","With regard to Marketing and Refining, our full year 2011 financial results were lower than 2010. Last week, HOVENSA, in which Hess has a 50% interest, announced it will close the joint venture refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The refinery has commenced shutdown and will become an oil storage terminal. Overall losses at the HOVENSA refinery have totaled $1.3 billion in the past 3 years and were projected to continue. These losses have been caused primarily by the global economic slowdown and the addition of new refining capacity in emerging markets. In addition, the low price of natural gas in the United States put HOVENSA, an oil field refinery, at a competitive disadvantage. HOVENSA examined every strategic option to maximize value, but ultimately severe financial losses left no other choice but to close. ","In Retail Marketing, while 2011 convenience store sales and average gasoline volumes per station were both down 2%, reflecting the weak economic environment, year-over-year earnings were higher. Also, our Energy Marketing business delivered strong operating results, but earnings were lower than last year. ","Our financial position remains strong. Our debt to capitalization ratio at year end was 25%, essentially unchanged from year-end 2010. 2011 was a difficult year, operationally, but important strategically. ","With the closure of the HOVENSA refinery, we have completed our transition to being predominantly an exploration and production company. Also, with the addition of our newly acquired acreage position in the Utica Shale, the company now has the critical mass for shale resources to make a significant contribution to our future production and reserve growth with lower risk than has been the case historically. Our principal focus in 2012 will be to execute our investment opportunities to sustain profitable growth and create value for our shareholders. ","I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill.","Gregory P. Hill","Thank you, John. My remarks will be primarily focused on our key investment priorities for 2012. With regard to unconventionals, we've built a very strong position in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota and enjoy significant competitive advantages in terms of scale, infrastructure and export capacity. ","In 2012, we plan to invest about $1.9 billion and operate 16 rigs with 5 dedicated hydraulic fracturing crews. We will continue be in the HBP mode of drilling this year, with most of the wells planned to be single laterals on 1280-acre spacing. This program will enable us to get the vast majority of our core acreage held by production by year-end 2012. ","We will also continue to invest in infrastructure projects, including the Tioga Gas Plant expansion and our crude oil rail loading and storage facility, which will become operational in February. Net production from the Bakken in 2012 is forecast to average 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or double the 2011 average of 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We expect net Bakken production to further increase to 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. ","In the Eagle Ford Shale, we plan to continue to delineate our acreage position, operating a 3-rig  program and drilling approximately 25 to 30 wells in 2012. Regarding the Utica Shale, our appraisal drilling program will be designed to delineate the oil-, liquids- and gas-rich areas on both our 100%-owned acreage and that owned by our 50-50 joint venture with CONSOL Energy. ","On our 100%-owned acreage, we plan to acquire 200 square miles of seismic and drill approximately 7 wells. The joint venture will also acquire approximately 200 square miles of seismic and plans to drill 22 wells. We will also continue to pursue and delineate unconventional opportunities globally. ","Now in addition to appraising and developing our unconventional portfolio, we will continue to invest in our conventional opportunities. Regarding the Valhall Field in Norway, in which Hess has a 64% interest, a multiyear field redevelopment project is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter. This project extends the field life by 40 years and provides a platform for future growth in reserves and production. In addition to investments and facilities, BP also plans to operate 2 drilling rigs in 2012. ","In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are progressing in the development of the Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess has a 57% working interest and is the operator. Facilities construction is underway, and drilling is planned to commence in mid-2012. First production is planned in 2014, with a peak annual net rate of about 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. ","In Australia, we will complete appraisal of Block WA-390-P by mid-2012 and aim to select the final liquefaction facility for the project during the year. Hess has a 100% interest and is the operator. ","Regarding explorations, results in recent years have not met expectations. In response, we are decreasing the level of spend in 2012, reducing risk through strategic partnering, focusing on fewer geographic areas and strengthening our organizational capability. Exploration remains an important growth engine for the corporation however, but we are committed to improving its performance.","In Ghana, we plan to commence further exploration drilling in the first quarter of 2012, following up on the previously announced Paradise discovery on the Hess-operated Deepwater Tano Cape Three Point south block. Our 2012 drilling program will target several other geologic structures and play types on the block. ","In Brunei, we plan to continue drilling in 2012 on Block CA-1, in which Hess has a 13.5% interest. Although the first well, Julong Center, failed to find commercial hydrocarbons and was expensed, we remain optimistic about the overall potential of the block. In Kurdistan, we plan to commence seismic acquisition on the Dinarta and Shakrok blocks in mid-2012, and progress drilling plans for 2013. Hess has an 80% interest and is operator of these blocks. ","In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we're advancing a number of Miocene prospects to drill-ready status and plan to provide additional details regarding this program later in the year. ","In closing, while we experienced a tough year operationally in 2011, we remain enthused about our portfolio of investment opportunities, and I want to reinforce what John said in his opening remarks. Our principal focus in 2012 will be to execute: First, deliver on our production and reserve growth targets; second, manage our operating costs and capital expenditures; and third, improve exploration results. ","Thank you. I will now hand the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare fourth quarter 2011 results to the third quarter. ","The corporation generated a consolidated net loss of $131 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with net income of $298 million in the third quarter. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the corporation had earnings of $394 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $379 million in the third quarter of 2011. ","Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production had income of $527 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with $422 million in the third quarter. Third quarter results included net after-tax charges of $81 million from items affecting comparability of earnings between periods. Excluding these items, the changes in the after-tax components of the earnings are as follows: Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $155 million. Higher selling prices increased earnings by $39 million. Higher exploration expenses decreased earnings by $142 million. Higher DD&A decreased earnings by $40 million. All other items net to an increase in earnings of $12 million for an overall increase in fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $24 million. ","Our E&P operations were over lifted in the fourth quarter compared with production, resulting in increased after-tax income of approximately $40 million. The E&P effective income tax rate was 38% for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2011. ","Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining incurred a loss of $561 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with a loss of $23 million in the third quarter. Fourth quarter results include an after-tax charge of $525 million related to the announced shutdown of Aventis refinery in St. Croix. This charge includes estimates of the corporation's share of future funding commitments for preserving assets, severance and other costs related to the shutdown, of which approximately $400 million is expected to be funded in 2012.","Excluding the refinery shutdown charge, the corporation's share of Aventis' results of operations was a loss of $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with a loss of $36 million in the third quarter. Port Reading had a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and broke even in the third quarter. ","Marketing earnings were $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase from $41 million in the third quarter, principally reflecting higher earnings in Energy Marketing. Trading activities generated a loss of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with a loss of $26 million in the third quarter. ","Turning to Corporate and Interest. Net corporate expenses were $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with $44 million in the third quarter. After-tax interest expense was $57 million in the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2011. ","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter, including a decrease of $275 million from changes in working capital, was $1.138 billion. Capital expenditures were $2.115 billion. Borrowings were $458 million. All other items amounted to an increase in cash of $43 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $476 million. ","We had $351 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011, and $1.608 billion at December 31, 2010. Total debt was $6.57 billion at December 31, 2011, and $5.583 billion at December 31, 2010. ","At year-end 2011, we had more than $3.8 billion available on our revolving credit facility. The corporation's debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2011, was 24.6% compared with 24.9% at the end of 2010. ","Turning to 2012 guidance. Net corporate expenses in 2012 are estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. We expect our 2012 after-tax interest expense to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million. For full year 2012 unit costs, our E&P cash operating costs are expected to be in the range of $20 to $21 per barrel of oil equivalent produced. ","Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses are expected to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel for a total production unit cost of $40.50 to $42.50 per barrel. We currently expect our E&P effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 40% for the full year of 2012. Both the unit cost and tax rate guidance exclude the impact of any Libyan operations. ","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm going to try 3 quick ones, if I may. On the production guidance, John, can you quantify the impact of the Valhall downtime? And, conversely, Bakken looks pretty strong if 60,000 is the average for the year. Can you give us an [indiscernible] on the '11 and what your anticipated exit rate will be or should be in 2012? And then I have a couple of quick follow-ups, please.","John B. Hess","You broke in and out a little bit. Just want to get the clarity on the 3 questions, please. Just repeat them real quick.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you hear me better now? No, I only asked one, John. I'm going to do the 2 afterwards. So the first one was, can you quantify the Valhall downtime, given the maintenance, the tie-in you're planning in the third quarter? And the Bakken looks very strong at 60 as an average, so can you give us an idea what the exit rate was in 2011, and what your expectations are for the exit rate in 2012? And then as I say, I've got a couple of quick follow-ups.","John P. Rielly","Doug, on Valhall, we have a 30-day shutdown. So it will be approximately a month that it'll be in the third quarter. So from a production standpoint, Valhall's productive capacity is above 30,000 barrels a day, so it will be shut down during that period in the third quarter. We're not exactly sure what the timing will be, so you'll see the impact in the third quarter of about a month's shutdown.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the Bakken exit rates?","John P. Rielly","I'm going to turn that over to Greg.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Doug, let me kind of provide a little context on the Bakken, first, that John briefly mentioned in his opening remarks. So, first of all, production from the Bakken's fully recovered, and we're firmly on the growth ramp with production averaging about 38,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter, which is an improvement of about 6 quarter-on-quarter. And, as John mentioned, we achieved a new high peak rate of just over 50,000 barrels a day in mid-December. Now, as you all know, because of the timing of new completions where you get fresh production followed by steep declines, daily production will fluctuate. However, these increasingly higher peaks, continued quarter-on-quarter improvement and continued reduction of the completion backlog through the addition of our fifth frac crew in Q4 give us pretty high confidence in our ability to achieve that 60,000-barrel a day average rate in 2012. Doug, as you know, we don't really quote exit rates for -- prospectively, but the one thing I will say is, we're in good shape at the year-end 2011 to continue to build that ramp in 2012.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. My second one is actually fairly quick. Greg, can you comment on the result of the Marquette well that had been drilled in the Utica? I believe you were going to try and complete that in Q4. Any results you can share?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Doug, I can. So, again, just a little bit of context on the Utica for others on the call. We're up to about 198,000 acres now in the Utica Shale. So we're very pleased with our early entry into that position and feel like it's a strategic acreage position, an emerging unconventional play. Remind everybody most of the land's either owned in fee or held by production, with the balance being under long-term leases. And, finally, the acreage has very high net revenue interest. So, again, a very nice position in an emerging play. Regarding the well, we recently completed that well in December that was drilled by Marquette prior to the acquisition. The well was drilled in a dry gas location, we knew that. But it was ready to complete, so we went ahead and completed it. And while we're still testing the well, we can report that the initial rate from the well was 11 million cubic feet per day on a 24\/64 choke. So that's a very good result. We're very pleased with that result. It's very encouraging, but, obviously, there's a lot more appraisal drilling necessary to delineate our acreage position and, in particular, figure out where the oil condensate and dry gas windows are.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, Greg, that's a 24-hour rate?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, that's initial rate, Doug.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. My last question and then I'll jump off is really on the risk in terms of -- it's really quite comforting to hear your comments about change in risk. So this one's really for John. John, what's behind the change of view on hedges? And if you could also talk about what your future thoughts are on taking working interest levels in exploration wells. Are we now moving away from 100% working interest on big wells? And I will leave it there.","John P. Rielly","Sure, Doug. I'll first talk about the hedges. I mean, hedges were put on in order to protect our 2012 cash flows, I mean, as you know, during this period of higher capital investment for our unconventional business. So, again, it's just to deal with the capital spend for the unconventional business. It's a volatile, cyclical business, and we wanted to protect our cash flows during this period. And then I'll turn it over to Greg to talk about exploration.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Doug, as I said in my opening remarks, one of the changes we are making to our exploration program is that we are going to take on more strategic partners. So that's code for get our working interest down. We're actively working a number of partner discussions in Ghana and the Gulf of Mexico, so that's all part of our strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe I'll start on the downstream. Given the recent HOVENSA announcement, I understand that you intend to take Port Reading down FCCU for maintenance in early February. I mean, should we expect to restart there in 4 weeks or is there maybe a broader strategic review related to the viability of the asset versus required CapEx, and particularly following HOVENSA closure and then the very minimal CapEx allocation in the downstream into 2012?","John B. Hess","Right. Well, Port Reading represents a much smaller part of our portfolio than HOVENSA does, and we plan to operate the facility as long as it generates acceptable financial returns. In regards to its current operating problems, they've had some catalyst losses and are evaluating different options, which probably include a short-term shutdown to restore normal operations. So those plans are being formalized. The time that it will be out might be about 3 weeks. But that has not been finalized yet if that's the option that's going to be pursued, but it's looking that way as of right now. But the bigger picture thing about the strategy is that, obviously, with the move in HOVENSA, we've become and we've completed our transition to predominantly an E&P company. And Port Reading itself, a smaller part of the portfolio, and we'll run it as long as it generates acceptable returns. I think another point, just to provide clarity, is that our Marketing businesses, both Energy Marketing as well as Retail Marketing, are a long-term strategic part of our portfolio. They generate strong financial returns and offer selective growth opportunities. So in terms of the sizing and shape and focus of our portfolio going forward, marketing will still be a key component of it.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. Another question on the upstream and relating to the Eagle Ford. I know you updated us on the pace of activity in 2012, but, I mean, how do you -- given some portfolio rationalization or some de-risking, I mean, how do you view this asset within your portfolio over the longer term? Is it a position you feel has sufficient, relative scale or is it a potential divestment or growth opportunity? How are you thinking about the Eagle Ford here?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we're really not in a position to answer that question yet because we're still in delineation mode. So our current focus remains on continuing to delineate our acreage, particularly the Northeast as we move into 2012. And we're pleased with the results to date. We've got 109,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford. We've drilled 29 wells. We've got 22 completed and on production now, 18 with 30-day IP rates, and those are ranging between 350 and 650, with an average of about 500. So, so far, so good on the Eagle Ford.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Good. If I could just slip in a last -- just a question to give us a quick update on the Bakken rail transloading facilities, and if we started railing barrels out of the Bakken yet.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So the facility will be fully operational at the end of February. We've got 9 train sets on location, which will give us an initial capacity to ship of 54,000 barrels a day. Now just to kind of test the rail and all that kind of stuff, we did sell 5 train loads of Bakken crude and achieved some premium Gulf Coast sweet crude pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","John, interesting that you decided to hedge this quite significant proportion of your production at $107.70, I believe you said, for 2012. When we look at your CapEx for the year upcoming and the cash flow that you made in 2011, there still seems to be a significant disconnect; that is to say, at an average of about a $110 Brent in 2011, your cash flows came in at about $5 billion, around $5 billion, depending on what we include and don't include. You've got more like a 6, well above $6 billion spend for 2012. The fact that you're hedging suggests that you like $107 as an oil price, you consider it to be an attractive price to sell at. Can you just square the circle in terms of how we get to living within your means, I think was always the line for the spend in 2012, and what we should assume that you're planning the company at from an oil price point of view and any other observations you have.","John B. Hess","No, it's a very fair question. Obviously, during this period where we are having these high investments made driven predominantly by the attractive opportunities we see in the unconventional space, led by the Bakken, and also in light of the uncertain global economic environment we're in, it's not so much that we're making an oil price call per se. But we thought it prudent to hedge some of our production for 2012, and mind you, it's just for 2012 that we're talking about, to protect our cash flows. And between our internally generated cash and the asset sales that we have contemplated, most of that gap should be covered. We feel very comfortable with our liquidity. Obviously, in the capital-intensive business we're in and the commodity business we're in, it's important to have a robust, strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. We will do what we have to do to ensure that. And between the asset sales that are contemplated that we will update you on as the year proceeds and the internal cash flow protected by our hedges, we feel pretty good about our liquidity situation, the ability to fund the majority of that gap.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. So the majority, essentially, will be an asset sale process, if I'm not wrong?","John B. Hess","Yes, with -- there are more asset sales contemplated, and as we progress those, we'll give you updates as appropriate.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then if we move on to the volume guidance, if I'm not wrong, it's a range of 0% to 5%, year-over-year. Would we expect you to get back to a 3% to 5% from the base in 2012 longer term now, given that there was a significant step-down in 2011, but we've still retained, if you like, around a 0% to 5% growth, as I say, for 2012?","John B. Hess","Yes, the first point there is that Libya, as you know, and just to be clear, is not in the numbers, and Libya is currently producing. We want a little more political stability to be shown in terms of conditions on the ground before we would feel comfortable putting that in the numbers. So that is one component that's out of the numbers that makes the numbers lower, but we think it's prudent to treat it that way right now.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the longer term will remain at 3% to 5%...","John B. Hess","Yes, our long-term rate is 3% to 5%, but we wanted to make it clear for people that given that we had the setbacks last year, that 3% to 5% is not on the lower base. If you talk about the lower base using 2012 and you look over the next 5 years, the production and reserve growth rates that we're looking at, underpinned by our investment in unconventionals, as well as the conventional opportunities that we have, is really more in the range of 4% to 7%. But to be very clear, our long-term rate, once we restore ourselves to the production trajectory that we have envisioned, is the 3% to 5%. So that's the reason we try to make it more clear for people, not confuse people. If you look at 2012 as basis, 4% to 7% over the next 5 years. If you look at that longer-term rate, once we restore the production volumes lost, the normalized rate is really the 3% to 5% production reserve growth target.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That is clarifying. And then very finally for me, the status of the U.S. E&P would potentially be advantageous to you from a tax and accounting point of view. Does the retention of retail prevent that? Can you just clarify exactly what your status would be because I think you said quite clearly that you want to retain the retail as part of Hess' overall operations.","John B. Hess","That is correct. Yes, no, we're intending to keep Retail Marketing and Energy Marketing as a long-term strategic position in our company.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just at least one longer-term question here. Given the comments you made on exploration and the changing emphasis there, is there a corresponding change in emphasis in how you think about acquisitions? You've done a number of, let's just say, joint ventures or kind of acreage-type deals, but they're kind of more classic acquisitions. I think, really since Triton, which I think is now 11 or 12 years ago, you've not participated in a meaningful way in the acquisition market. How do we think about that being a part of Hess' strategy going forward?","John B. Hess","Arjun, obviously, you're always looking at outside opportunities to see if they upgrade your portfolio. At the same time, with the capital commitments we have, both in unconventional and conventional investments for 2012, our focus is going to be on executing those investments to deliver the profitable growth that we are aspiring to.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I think, John, it's probably fair to say that relative to the lower 2012 number, the 4% to 7% growth is all from stuff you have in hand, whether it's Pony, Tubular Bells, Bakken and so forth. I guess, the question then becomes, does the Eagle Ford work? Does the Utica work? And, then, do you have enough of an inventory beyond that? That, I presume, is then how you think about the toggle of acquisitions needing to play a greater role?","John B. Hess","Yes...","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The point being you've got the next 4 or 5 years kind of lined up. But, then you do need some of these other things to work out if you're going to perpetuate this longer term, x exploration.","John B. Hess","Fair enough. The Utica, really, God willing, it works out and, as Greg pointed out, we're encouraged by the first well, but we've got upwards of 25 to 30 wells to go in 2012 to give us a better feel for the opportunity that we have here, and we need to appraise it. But if you look at our growth rate, the majority of that growth rate has been secured already because of our work in the Bakken, what we think we're going to get out of the Valhall, Tubular Bells. You've listed the different options there. So it's not wishful thinking in terms of how are we going to secure that growth rate. We really think we've secured those investment opportunities already, and the key now is to execute and deliver performance from them. Obviously, if we're lucky enough to get some upside on that, all the better. Exploration delivering better performance in the longer term, all the better. But acquisitions are not part of that production growth. It's really from the internally generated opportunities we already have in our portfolio.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's terrific, and sorry for another hedging question, but should we expect you to hedge some decent portion of your production on a rolling-forward basis when we get to the end of this year? It -- obviously it depends on price to some degree, but is this part of your ongoing strategy now?","John B. Hess","It is something we will always consider as a way of reducing the risk and securing our cash flows. This was more a 2012 decision, in terms of we think it prudent, given the uncertain economic environment that we're in and also the high capital spend, for us to take some insurance out. At the same time, it's not indicative of what we're necessarily going to do in 2013 or future years.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just a last one, just on the Bakken. I believe you're sticking with plus or minus the 16 rigs for this year, and I understand it's more about holding the acreage, so you're not doing the dual laterals or be in a manufacturing mode. Can you just remind me when you get through that and then where you think that rig count can grow once you get to kind of let's call it manufacturing mode for your core areas of the Bakken?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Arjun, I think, I mean for this year, again, as you mentioned, we're in HBP mode with 16 rigs. We'll get through all that during 2012. 2012 was really let's get all of our core acreage held, particularly the stuff that we picked up in acquisitions from Tracker and American Oil & Gas. After that, we'll be back into pad drilling and our long-term development strategy. Right now, we'll say we'll do that with 16 rigs, but that's subject to change. I mean, it could be more. Also, it depends on infill. There's a number of factors that could drive that rig count higher.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry to interrupt. To hit your long-term Bakken targets, we presume you'll have to drill -- you'll have to use additional rigs, unless there's something in there that the IPs are coming in better, the EURs are coming in better. We assume you'll need more rigs to get to your longer-term targets. Is that fair?","Gregory P. Hill","No, no, no, you shouldn't. Basically, the 120,000 barrels a day is premised on a 16, a continuous 16-rig program through 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In Bakken, in the past, you've given some well data. Now that you have -- you should have more well datas under the 38-stage frac, can you give us some data, what's the 30-day IP on those? And if you have any better indication that what is the recoverable rate that you are going to be and also the costs right now?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, sure. So let me kind of hit all 3 of those, Paul. So, first of all, on the well rates, we've got 113, 34-plus stage systems installed in the Bakken with 76 on production now. And those wells have 30-day IPs that are continuing to average 1,000 barrels a day. So we're very pleased by those results. And as we continue to improve our subsurface understanding, of course, we'll optimize those frac stages and designs to maximize profitability. So areas with very good rock, we may reduce the number of frac stages from 38 to something smaller as a way to maximize profitability. Well costs while we're in HBP mode, still about $10 million per well. One thing that I think people sometimes don't remember is that first well that you're drilling in this HBP mode carries a lot of the costs because we build the pad for 6 to 8 wells, we bring all the infrastructure up to the well pad, getting ready for that pad drilling. So $10 million is still a pretty good HBP well cost. Regarding EURs, we're still sticking with the 550 for now. We're just waiting to get enough statistical data to have confidence to increase those EURs.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And, Greg, do you have a cash operating cost on those well that has been running for more than 30 days, on a BOE basis?","John P. Rielly","Sorry, Paul, we don't give that kind of detailed data on the individual assets. But you can see that our cash operating costs have been relatively flat, actually dropped a little bit in the fourth quarter, and guidance for next year is relatively flat on an overall basis for the portfolio on a cash basis. And that's with high commodity prices, so we are affected by higher production taxes, so...","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. This is also for Greg. Greg, you have said that you want to lower your future risk on the exploration front, so 2 questions on that. One, you still budget for $800 million for this year, and you probably do, say, based on your estimate, midpoint, 380,000 barrels per day, for the year you're going to do about roughly 140 million barrel. And so that means that you're spending about $6 per BOE of your production, give or take. Do you think that given your focus on the unconventional oil sites, that seems to be still a bit too high? Secondly, that -- on that base in the Indonesian deepwater, are you going to -- still going to drill the next well if you cannot find a partner?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, let me speak to the Indonesian well first. So this was the Semai V well. Recall that, that block has a 3-well commitment. We've drilled 2 wells. The first well was the deep well, the Semai V well, whereas John mentioned in his opening remarks, we did find a significant amount of sand, and we did find hydrocarbons. It just wasn't in it -- saturations just weren't commercial. So, actually, from a geologic modeling and for this giant basin in the Banda Arc, we're actually pleased with understanding that well. Second well was a shallower well that we drilled, a commitment well. Third well, we have to discuss with the government just to basically understand all the data.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So you're still going to drill the third well?","Gregory P. Hill","We'll know subject to discussions with government.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Now two final question. One, for John Rielly. John, the U.S. cash tax, what is the percent of the IPD that you can weigh off or that you can use, and are you paying any U.S. cash tax? And what may that look like in the 2012? And then the last question is that, Greg, can you give us an idea that where's the process of the Ghana Fandan [ph]? I mean, you closed the data room on the 15. By now you're still under evaluation. Is it because you have too many bid or that you don't have enough bid? I mean, just give us some idea that -- what that process, why that it may take a bit longer before you come to a conclusion on that.","John P. Rielly","Okay, Paul. So I'll start with your question on the IDC in the U.S. So as an integrated oil company, we can write off or expense 70% of our intangible drilling cost in the year that it's incurred. So from that standpoint, as Greg has mentioned, and Greg and John talked about our unconventional budget, we have significant drilling going on, obviously, in the Bakken, Utica and Eagle Ford. So of the well costs that relate to IDC, we can take 70% of those costs. The remaining 30%, then, is amortized over 5 years. So it does provide us significant deductions in the U.S., and that will continue in 2012.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, can you give us an -- what estimate, how much is that? Is that -- or of the drilling cost, how much is the IDC?","John P. Rielly","Of a well -- it differs per well, so it can be anywhere from 65% to even up to 90% of a well cost, but somewhere in that range from an overall standpoint.","Gregory P. Hill","Okay, Paul, in regard to the Ghana well, we have a number of interested parties in the well. We're evaluating all the offers and are in discussions with multiple parties.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Any rough timeline when that you may come to a conclusion?","John B. Hess","Well, I mean, we're going to start drilling late first quarter, or early second quarter, so we'd like to have our partners before we start drilling the well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman with The Bench Company.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","I had a couple of things. So, Greg, could you give us a little bit of color on the CA-1 well? I think it was considered to be, really, more of an appraisal than necessarily a wildcat in terms of what you learned from it?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, the first well that we drilled where it was called the Julong Center well, and that was chosen by the operator to test the aerial extent of a very large structure akin to Kikeh and Gumusut. So although the well failed to encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, we remain encouraged by the potential on the block. Obviously, there's some direct offsetting structures that come down from Kikeh and Gumusut. This is designed to test something else that was a look-alike, basically. So the current plan is to drill 5 additional wells on that block, and, in fact, the drilling rig is en route to begin drilling the next well, which is called Julong East.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. If I could go to the Bakken for just a sec. Greg, I think I saw something that suggests you've relinquished a pretty good slug of what had been your pre-existing position, and you're down to something in the neighborhood of 650,000 net. So could you confirm if that's accurate, and any thoughts you might have as to what the ultimate spacing's going to be in terms of what you're going to do when you get to a pad drilling kind of environment.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So, no, our acreage position is still around just under 900,000 net acres. Now we've always said that we believe about 2\/3 of that's core. And as we continue to focus on our core acreage, we'll divest or we'll let leases expire that we don't consider optimal to our development, but we're still close to 900,000 acres today.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","And the spacing question?","Gregory P. Hill","We've got a number of spacing pilots underway, too early to draw any conclusions. As I've said before, Mark, my gut is, is that you're going to go to a tighter spacing on the Bakken, ultimately.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. John Rielly, curious as to what you need to do, from an accounting standpoint, in terms of lease amortization with respect to the Utica acreage that you acquired. Is there a clock that starts running that says so much of that has to be amortized over the term of the lease?","John P. Rielly","Basically, what happens is, as we drill, we will allocate acquisition cost as part -- from that acreage to the wells, and it will flow through our DD&A as the wells are drilled. So there will be a higher DD&A on those wells. And that's the same for the JV and our 100%-owned acreage.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, but you don't have to separately amortize the acquisition cost?","John P. Rielly","No, we don't have to separately amortize it. Let me just, I guess, just talk about DD&A, in general, for the portfolio. So, I mean, I just want to point out that the majority of our production is liquids, right? So, I mean, in general, our unit cost, because our production is focused on the liquids side, is going to be higher because it costs more to produce oil than it does natural gas. But, obviously, in this environment, it generates much higher margins. So from an overall standpoint, just while you're on that point, from the acquisitions that we have related to the Utica, as well as in the Bakken, our DD&A costs are moving higher from 2011 and into 2012, primarily due to those significant upfront investments in the unconventionals. So besides the acquisition costs, it includes large infrastructure investments, and so we believe these will create value, shareholder value, for many years. And so what happens is the initial DD&A rates, they're high because the reserve bookings lag the investment dollars. The Life-of-Field rate is expected to be much lower. So that's the reason from an overall standpoint on our DD&A costs.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. If I could just probe the asset sales question a little bit. It strikes me that a potential candidate might very well be your mature U.K. North Sea assets. Am I on the right track in that regard?","John B. Hess","We're not going to comment on speculated or prospective sales, Mark, for obvious reasons. But as we make progress on some of these asset sales, we'll inform investors appropriately.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And, Greg, my final one. Just to clarify your comments about Julong and Brunei, the well that you drilled was not testing the offsets to Kikeh, but rather, a look-alike prospect?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, that's true. So it was not testing the offsets, it was actually testing another structure that had a similar look as Kikeh and Gumusut. Very long structure, the well was drilled all the way out on the very far aerial extent of the structure. It had hydrocarbons in it, but just not in commercial quantities.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I'm going to sneak in just one final one. Any interest that you've observed in terms of the intent to farm out an interest in BMS 22? But I think the partners have agreed to take a look at that for the purpose, potentially, of drilling another well or 2?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, so the data room was open. That farm out process is closed now, and the partners are due to meet in February to discuss options and to plan forward. Beyond that, you'll have to refer to Exxon, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted -- I was hoping maybe you could elaborate a little bit on Libya. If I heard you correctly, it sounds like you're not currently producing from there, which, I guess, I'm a little confused. I thought that field was back online, at least to a certain extent. And on that front, if you could also just kind of give us some clarity on getting back to peak production. I mean, is there capital investment required, and if so, is there any kind of discussion on -- of renegotiation of fiscal terms?","John B. Hess","Fair enough question.  No, Libya is producing, and I think the gross rate of Waha, or Oasis in English, the name of our concession, is about 200,000 barrels a day. So we have about 8% of that, and I think the number's about 13 or so. But in terms of forecasting the volumes in our production forecast, we don't feel comfortable putting that in, yet. So it is producing, and in terms of terms of reentry, we're talking to our partners and the Libyan National Oil company about that. Everything is encouraging, but there is still a long way to go to iron out a lot of the details. As you can well understand, they're recovering from a civil war. So it's going to take some time to provide more clarity that you're looking for. We're looking for the same clarity that you are.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then the only other one I have for you, CapEx, I know you've given us '12 guidance here. But in order to achieve this 4% to 7% growth through 2017, can you give us just a general feel of what kind of number we should be looking at, post 2012? I mean, is that like a -- roughly a $6 billion type of number?","John B. Hess","Again, we'll give you the update on 2013 as we get closer to '13.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, just 2 questions. The 4% to 7% volume growth, have you put anything in there for Libya, for Australia LNG?","John P. Rielly","Yes, we do. I mean, over the longer term, we are projecting in that forecast that we will get the Libyan volumes back on. So, again, that's what, as John was talking about before, just trying to take those temporary setbacks out of that. As far as of Australian LNG at this point, no, we have that further out, so that's not in that number.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Good. And then just coming back to Bakken well costs, obviously, $10 million today, but -- in HBP drilling. What sort of scale of cost reduction do you think you can achieve from a change as you move to pad drilling and maybe sliding sleeve? And then the other question is, what are you seeing in terms of pricing, particularly on the pressure pumping side, given gas markets are weak? Any improvements?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So let me address the pressure pumping question first. So just for clarity, all of our rigs are full-time pressure pumping services. So that's 5 frac spreads are locked in under longer-term contracts. So we don't anticipate significant cost increases in 2012, other than those things that fluctuate with commodity prices because that's the way the contracts are written. So fuel and chemicals and things like that are allowed to float and are negotiated, obviously, with commodity prices. So that's kind of what we see there.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And on the ability to reduce costs as you shift out of HBPs?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, well costs, again, I think these HBP wells, they're heavy loaded because you do build a big pad and you build the road to the facility, and you build the piping up to the edge of the pad. As we get into lean manufacturing and pad drilling, I can expect we can bring that well cost much closer to 9, and also with sliding sleeves as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","On the Utica, do you guys expect any permitting difficulties as you expand your footprint in the play?","Gregory P. Hill","No. We're engaging with all the authorities, as we speak, along with our partner, CONSOL. And, so far, we haven't encountered any permitting difficulties whatsoever.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And then on a similar question, different geography, anything new that you're hearing happening in the Paris Basin, on the regulatory front, in particular?","Gregory P. Hill","No, I think, as we've said before, we're in the midst of a presidential election, so we don't anticipate any major breakthroughs until after that presidential election. But our plans for the Paris Basin this year are to commence drilling conventional wells later in 2012. These wells are going to be nonfractured, vertical wells designed to obtain maximum subsurface data. Now how do we feel about the Paris basin? While we believe it'll take time to work through the issues, we're confident, of course, that drilling and completion operations can be done safely and responsibly. So we remain very actively engaged with local and national stakeholders to progress the appraisal of those licenses.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just last quick one. Having appraised your initial discovery in Ghana, any sense of the pre-drill resource estimate for the follow-on well?","Gregory P. Hill","No, there's not. I mean, at -- so Paradise itself, it's going to require another appraisal well to figure out how big that is. What we do know is, we've got good sand, and we've got oil, and we've got gas condensate in that reservoir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Given your desire to de-risk your exploration program, how should we expect or how should we look at your exploration expense or exploration capital trending over the next couple of years?","John B. Hess","Yes, it's similar to the capital expenditure point for 2013. We'll give you an estimate on that as we get closer to 2013. But Greg's comments were the key ones, which is we need to improve the performance of exploration and, as a consequence, we're downsizing the dollars and, also, bringing in strategic partners, bringing more focus and also strengthening our organization capability, all in the interest of improving the performance of that. But be clear, exploration is a long-term strategic part of Hess.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And you talked about needing to hedge out your production for this year to protect your operating cash flow for your CapEx program, and you talked about kind of this peak level of CapEx that you have for this year and I don't know for how long. But, I mean, how long do you expect this sort of peak capital intensity to continue in your unconventional program?","John B. Hess","Same answer that I gave before. We're just focusing on '12. We're not make any forecast for '13 or '14.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then the $36 F&D cost that you guys reported last year. Do you think that number is the right number going forward, or is that going to trend down over time?","John P. Rielly","In 2011, our FD&A costs, I mean, again, it increased primarily as a result of the shift towards unconventionals, which, as I mentioned earlier, require significant upfront investment in the acreage, infrastructure and drilling. And so if we're going to talk about just 1 year to your question, I just want to give you some additional context. So included in the 2011 FD&A cost was $1 billion of acreage acquisition costs in the Utica and Kurdistan, which added no reserves last year, as you would expect. But, over time, obviously, as we drill it up, we'll be able to book those reserves. In addition to that, we had PFC effects, which resulted in negative price revisions of 25 million barrels. So if you're just looking in 1 year, if you were to exclude these items, our F&D costs would have been approximately $28 per barrel. And then as John Hess had mentioned earlier, I mean, that's why we look at this more from a long-term standpoint, our 5-year average replacement ratio was 153% at an FD&A cost of $23 per barrel.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do the infrastructure costs in the Bakken, the processing plant and the real [indiscernible], do those go into that F&D calculation?","John P. Rielly","Yes, they do.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And how much was that number last year?","John P. Rielly","We've been running approximately $400 million in the Bakken for infrastructure-related costs.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Does it ever make sense to kind of offload those sort of costs to like infrastructure players?","John P. Rielly","Again, we are managing our growth right now and, with the amount of growth and the upside that we see in the Bakken, we like having those facilities in our portfolio.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I was just thinking from a cost of capital perspective. Obviously, guys who have pipelines and infrastructure have a much lower cost of capital than upstream companies do.","John B. Hess","Fair question, but you have to also understand the scale of our infrastructure gives us a competitive advantage in terms of the development of the Bakken itself, so it's actually a strategic advantage to create value for shareholders that we actually hold on to the infrastructure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Some quick ones. Regarding proppant, any problems acquiring it for the unconventional plays?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, John, I think we did see some tightness in the Bakken market this year on proppant, where we couldn't get enough white sand, so we had to switch to some medium-strength proppant. I think you're seeing, as the gas rigs fall off and whatnot, we think that's going to ease the tightening.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Regarding your Deepwater program going forward, are you looking at it as a net reserve exposure basis or a net capital exposure? And will you try to balance a Gulf of Mexico versus international pursuits or it's just really prospect dependent or concession dependent?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, John, I would say it's prospect dependent. I mean, we're going to go wherever we think the most profitable opportunities are to add reserves and production.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Last one for me. With Port Reading would it behoove you to run at less than 50,000 barrels a day, so you'd be treated completely as an independent?","John B. Hess","I'm not sure if Port Reading is going to -- when you say independent, I'm not sure quite what you're driving at. You might elaborate on that a little bit.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","From accounting purposes for SEC, if you process less than 50,000 barrels a day, you're an E&P. Remember Louisiana Land, remember Winoco [ph] a decade ago, they were E&Ps with the refining assets. So then you get full IDCs.","John P. Rielly","No, John, in that case, once -- the retail stations also count in that from an integrated standpoint. So, no. As John said, the Energy Marketing business, the retail businesses, and we're continuing operating Port Reading, they're part of our core business. And so it wouldn't matter even if Port Reading was not in the portfolio, we would not be considered independent.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Katherine Minyard with JPMorgan.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. Just can I confirm, are the hedges, are they swaps or are they puts?","John B. Hess","They're swaps.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then in terms of Pony, are we still looking at potential sanctioning in this year?","Gregory P. Hill","What I will say is, about Pony, is we're still in discussions with the partners about trying to advance that project. Obviously, with 5 companies, it's difficult to progress things quickly.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, sure. And then just a final question. I believe John Rielly just talked about $400 million a year in Bakken infrastructure spending. Is that also the right run rate for the current year? As we look at the $1.9 billion, is about $400 million of that related to infrastructure, again, in 2012?","John P. Rielly","It's actually a little higher in 2012. So we're saying about $500 million will be infrastructure related, and then you should see a tail-off because the gas plant expansion, it's a heavy year related to the gas plant.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A session for today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay Wilson","Thank you, Amanda. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","Now as usual with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John Hess","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy, Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results.","Our company delivered strong performance this quarter. Our portfolio which is balanced between our growth engines in Guyana and Bakken and our cash engines in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Thailand is positioned to deliver approximately 20% compound annual cash flow growth and more than 10% compound annual production growth through 2025 at a $65 per barrel Brent oil price.","In addition, we project that our portfolio breakeven will decrease to less than $40 per barrel Brent by 2025. A key driver of our strategy is also our Guyana and extraordinary investment opportunity that is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, low cost, rapid cash paybacks and superior financial returns.","The Stabroek Block Guyana where Hess has a 30% interest in ExxonMobil is the operator, covers 6.6 million acres and contains a massive world-class resource that keeps getting bigger and better. We continue to have exploration success on the block with three new discoveries since the start of 2019 at Tilapia, Haimara and Yellowtail.","Last Thursday, we announced that the Yellowtail number 1 well located about 6 miles from Tilapia, encountered approximately 292 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir. This discovery is the fifth in the greater Turbot area, which is expected to become another major development hub.","In February, we announced that the Tilapia number 1 well encountered approximately 305 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir, the thickest net pay of any well yet drilled on the block. Tilapia is located approximately 3 miles west of the Longtail number 1 well, which is also in the greater Turbot area.","In February, we also announced that the Haimara number 1 well located in the southeastern part of the block, encountered approximately 207 feet of high quality gas condensate bearing sandstone reservoir. We have now made 13 significant discoveries on the block since 2015, which will underpin at least five floating production storage and offloading vessels to produce more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2025.","Gross discovered recoverable resources on the block are estimated to be more than 5.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent with multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. The Liza Phase 1 development is progressing well and remains on track to achieve first oil by the first quarter of 2020, less than five years after discovery.","This phase will develop approximately 500 million barrels of oil utilizing the Lisa Destiny FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to a 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The Liza Phase 2 developments will use the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day with startup expected by mid 2022.","A final investment decision is expected soon subject to government and regulatory approvals. Planning is also underway for a third phase of development at the Payara field, which is expected to have the capacity to produce between a 180,000 and 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day from the third FPSO. Sanction is expected to occur before the end of this year with first oil in 2023.","Also key to our long-term strategy is the Bakken where we have a 15-year inventory of high return drilling locations. Our transition this year to plug-and-perf completions from our previous 60 stage sliding sleeve design is expected to increase the net present value of the assets by approximately $1 billion.","Bakken net production is expected to grow approximately 20% per year to $200,000 of oil equivalent per day by 2021, generating approximately $1 billion of annual free cash flow post 2020 at a $60 per barrel WTI oil price.","Now turning to our financial results. In the first quarter of 2019, we posted net income of $32 million or $0.09 per share versus an adjusted net loss of $72 million or $0.27 per share in the year ago quarter. Compared to 2018, our first quarter financial results primarily reflect our strong production performance, which was partially offset by lower oil prices and higher DDNA expenses.","First quarter net production averaged 278,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya above our guidance of approximately 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and up from 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter, pro forma for the sale of our Utica joint venture interest. Bakken net production averaged 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day up from 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2018.","In closing, our company remains committed to executing our strategy that will deliver increasing financial returns, visible and low risk production growth, and accelerating free cash flow well into the next decade.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Greg Hill","Thanks John. I would like to provide an update on our progress in 2019 as we continue to execute our strategy. Starting with production, in the first quarter, net production averaged 278,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, which was above our guidance of approximately 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong operating performance across our portfolio.","In the second quarter, we expect net production to average between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. This reflects the impact from plant shutdown and maintenance activities at North Malay Basin in Malaysia and at the Tubular Bells and Baldpate fields in the Gulf of Mexico, all of which was included in our full year guidance that we provided in January of 270,000 to 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. As usual, we will update our full year guidance on our second quarter call in July.","In the Bakken, we delivered a strong quarter capitalizing on the success of our new plug-in-perf completion designs. Despite severe weather conditions in the Williston Basin in February, first quarter production averaged 130,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day an increase of more than 17% from the year ago quarter and within our guidance range of 130,000 to 135,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In the first quarter, we drilled 38 wells and brought 25 wells online. Weather conditions in the basin have improved. And in the second quarter, we expect to drill approximately 40 wells and bring online approximately 45 new wells. For the full year 2019, we still expect to drill about 170 wells and bring 160 wells online per our January guidance.","In the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken net production will average between 135,000 and 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And for the full year 2019, we continue to forecast production to average between 135,000 and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, approximately 20% above 2018 levels.","Moving to the offshore, first quarter production performance was strong in our Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia, Thailand assets. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day; and in the Gulf of Thailand, net production averaged approximately 68,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Now turning to Guyana. Our exploration success on the Stabroek Block continues with three new discoveries so far in 2019 at Tilapia, Haimara and Yellowtail, bringing the total number of discoveries on the block to 13. In terms of drilling activities, the Stena Carron recently completed a drill stem tests of Longtail and is now drilling the top whole section of Hammerhead-2, after which it will begin drilling Hammerhead-3.","Following the completion of well operations at Yellowtail, the Noble Tom Madden will drill out Hammerhead-2. Results from these tests will provide data for the operator to size and optimize plan of development for this area. Drilling plans for 2019 also include a second well at Ranger and three additional exploration wells the locations of which are being finalized.","Now turning to our Guyana developments. Liza Phase 1 is progressing to schedule. At the Keppel yard in Singapore, installation of topside modules is now complete on the 120,000 barrel of oil per day Liza Destiny FPSO and commissioning activities are underway. The vessel is expected to arrive offshore Guyana in the third quarter of 2019.","Drilling over the Phase 1 development wells is proceeding and installation of subsea infrastructure as well advanced with installation of subsea umbilicals, risers and flow lines planned for the second quarter. We're on track to achieve first oil by the first quarter of 2020. Liza Phase 2 will utilize the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Six drill centers are planned with a total of 30 wells including 15 production wells, nine water injection wells and six gas injection wells.","Government and regulatory approvals are expected soon after which final project sanction will be taken. First oil remains on track for mid 2022. The final investment decision is also expected later this year for a third phase of development Payara, which is expected to have a gross capacity of between 180,000 and 220,000 barrels of oil per day with start off as early as 2023.","In closing, our team once again demonstrated excellent execution and delivery across our asset base. Our offshore cash engines continue to generate reliable cash flow. The Bakken is on a strong capital efficient growth trajectory and Guyana continues to get bigger and better, which in combination position us to deliver industry-leading returns, material cash flow generation and significant shareholder value for many years to come.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John Rielly","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2018. We reported net income of $32 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to an adjusted net loss of $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Turning to E&P. E&P had net income of $109 million in the first quarter compared to a net loss of $5 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of E&P results, between the first quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018, were as follows.","Lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $57 million. Lower cash costs increased earnings by $37 million. Lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $35 million. Changes in sales volume increased earnings by $7 million. Lower realized selling prices decreased earnings by $9 million. All other items decreased earnings by $13 million for an overall increase in first-quarter earnings of $114 million.","Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $37 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Midstream EBITDA before non-controlling interests amounted to $129 million in the first quarter compared to $127 million in the previous quarter. For corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $114 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $104 million on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Turning to our financial position. At quarter end, cash and cash equivalents were $2.3 billion excluding Midstream, and total liquidity was $6.7 billion including available commented credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.7 billion. In April, Hess entered into a new fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility that matures in May 2023 and replaces our previous credit facility that was scheduled to mature in January 2021.","Cash flow from operations before working capital changes was $635 million, while cash expenditures for capital investments were $678 million in the first quarter, including cash consideration of $89 million for the Midstream assets acquired from Summit. Changes in working capital decreased cash flows from operating activities by $397 million in the first quarter.","This included a one-time repayment of approximately $130 million to our joint venture partner for each share sale-leaseback proceeds related to our sale of the North Malay Basin floating storage and offloading vessel, which was completed in the third quarter of 2018. The remaining working capital items included semiannual interest payments on debt and increase in accounts receivable and a reduction in accounts payable.","In the first quarter, we adopted the new lease accounting standard which resulted in the recognition of operating lease liabilities of approximately $800 million on our consolidated balance sheet. The adoption does not impact our P&L or cash flow.","Turning to guidance. Our first quarter production, cash unit cost and capital and exploratory expenditures beat guidance and position us favorably for the full year. As is our normal practice, we will update full year guidance on our second quarter conference call. With respect to the second quarter, as Greg mentioned, we expect production and cash unit cost to be impacted by plant maintenance shutdown at North Malay Basin and at the Tubular Bells and Baldpate fields.","These plant shutdowns were incorporated in our full year guidance provided in January. We project E&P cash cost excluding Libya to be in the range of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent in the second quarter of 2019, up from $11.54 per barrel oil equivalent in the first quarter, reflecting higher costs for the planned maintenance shutdowns and higher second quarter work over activities in the Bakken including weather-related deferrals from the first quarter.","DD&A expense excluding Libya was $18.37 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2019 and is forecast to be in the range of $18 to $19 per barrel oil equivalent in the second quarter 2019. This results in projected total E&P and operating cost excluding Libya of $31 to $33 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter.","Exploration expenses excluding dry-hole costs are expected to be the range of $45 to $55 million in the second quarter and the Midstream tariff is expected to be approximately $170 million in the second quarter. The E&P effective tax rate excluding Libya is expected to be expense in the range of 5% to 9% for the second quarter.","Our 2019 crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We have 95,000 barrels of oil per day Hedge for calendar 2019 with $60 WTI put option contracts. We expect option premium amortization to be approximately $29 million per quarter in 2019.","E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $750 million in the second quarter, which includes drilling the Llano-5 well in the Gulf of Mexico that was deferred from the first quarter and drilling and completing more wells in the Bakken with tough winter conditions behind us.","For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess on the Midstream segment to be approximately $35 million in the second quarter. For corporate, for the second quarter of 2019 corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. This concludes my remarks.","We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Bob Brackett","I will start by observing that it took 22 days to drill Yellowtail and then from that start to think about the cadence of what you're doing this year in terms of the exploration program. And how do you feel about the commentary with ExxonMobil potentially adding a fourth exploration drillship?","Greg Hill","Yes, thanks, Bob. Yes, ExxonMobil is indicated they do plan to add a fourth rig to the theater. However, the drilling sequence and all that, we're still working out with the operator. I think they announced, they will come into the theater sometime in September. But what gets drilled on our block and their other blocks joint blocks, we're still working with that with the operator. So stay tuned on that.","Bob Brackett","And in terms of once Hammerhead-2 and Hammerhead-3 are appraised, what are the Tom Madden and Stena Carron going to do? Have you decided that?","Greg Hill","Yes, I think, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we definitely want to get a second well down at Ranger and then we have three other expiration wells right now. The sequence of which are being worked out between us and the operator, also depending on success and what you find remember, you might have an appraisal well or testing or whatever as success continues on the block.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Arun Jayaram","Greg, I was wondering, if you could detail maybe the objectives that at Hammerhead 2 and 3? And also maybe give us a little bit more color on Haimara 1, and if you guys tested the deeper objective at Haimara?","Greg Hill","So, let me start with the appraisal wells. Obviously, the objective of those is to understand the extent of the reservoir and continuity of the reservoir. So, that's really the purpose. Haimara that will feature later in the sequence, again, I think the plan is to have some appraisal wells there as well, but the sequence and cadence of when that comes, again we're still working all that with the operator.","Arun Jayaram","Did you all test anything deeper at Haimara? Or is that going to be the next potential well.","Greg Hill","That will probably subject to later appraisal.","Arun Jayaram","Fair enough. Greg, switching gears to the Bakken. Just wondering, if you could highlight any of the testing that you planned at Goliath and Red Sky? And also, we also noted this week that you had, we think as maybe a record kind of Bakken completion at Brumback [ph]. I don't know, if you could maybe comment a little bit on that well, which can hit the state. I think it had an IP in the 10,000 BOE range.","Greg Hill","Yes, let me start with the Brumback [ph] well test. Why we'd do that? It was really designed to better understand open flow potential, and it was a great result because we believe that the well achieved the highest IP-24 ever recorded for U.S. onshore well and that was some 14,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now while we achieved a very high IP rate and it confirmed that our acreage performed very strongly in comparison to other operators.","We don't think this completion technique will be the standard practice just simply due to the higher costs and efficiencies. But again, it was a great well, great result. Regarding the testing in the Goliath acreages, as we kind said earlier in the year, we will drill 25 wells or so outside the core areas this year and that's really just to begin to establish what completion practices do we want in different parts of the field.","Our current standard design is 36-stage with about 280 entry points. We know that that can vary as we get out to other areas of the field, so we really want to get some wells out in that area to begin to understand and optimize what completion designs will be. Because obviously in the future, those will feature in our inventory, so we want to get ahead of that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Devin McDermott","My first question is on Guyana and as given the continued success there, incremental discoveries, growing resource size. I just wanted to talk at a high level about how that might impact the long-term development plan, which I\u2019m sure is still in flux? But what I\u2019m thinking about is specifically, how the potential might be for pallet developments, tiebacks or better use of shared infrastructure that might drive down the cost overtime or improve returns on the development of future phases?","John Hess","Devin, good question. Obviously, a lot of our work this year is to do further appraisal, to start to get more clarity on the answer to your question. ExxonMobil is the operator and we're working closely with them or trying to optimize what that development will be obviously with the bigger resource. We're still looking at phasing, but it is possible that we will be more than five ships going forward to produce oil, but the key is going to be doing further appraisal on the resource that we have and evaluation worked really optimize what the ultimate development will be. So, work in progress.","Devin McDermott","Got it, make sense. And then shifting over to the Bakken, as noted on the call and one of the previous question, the results there continued to be strong and even with the weather issue that was seen in the past quarter. You guys came in within guidance. I just wonder, if you could give an update on, you know, what you're seeing there as you roll out the plug-and-perf completions across all of your wells relative the guidance and base plan you all laid out last year?","John Hess","Yes, I think as you mentioned, we did have a good performance in the first quarter and despite the bad weather, we actually got 10 wells last online and what was in our plan, but still were able to stay within the guidance. We guided that these high intensity plug-and-perf completions are delivering a 15% to 20% increase in IP 180 and 5% to 10% increase in EUR versus at previous sliding 60-stage sliding sleeve design.","We\u2019re confirming those results. I mean, we're well within that range. Because wherever we're drilling in the first quarter was a little better than that, but that's still going to be our guidance for the year. And as John mentioned in his opening remarks, this is going to increase Bakken NPV by over billion at $60 WTI. So far so good, we're very pleased with the results.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","John Abbott","This is John Abbott on for Doug Leggate. Doug is currently on a plane. Doug is currently on a plane flying back from the Destiny FPSO. I'm sure he's listening in on the plane, if the Wi-Fi is working. He has sent me a list of questions. His first being, it is his belief that the FPSO will sell in mid-June and likely be in Guyana in August. Can you now confirm that first oil may possibly start before the end of the year?","Greg Hill","Well, I think as we said in our opening remarks, we expect first oil by first quarter 2020. The project is going well. The project is ahead of schedule. There is a chance that it will be on before that. I think it's the reason that there is a little bit left in the schedule is because we started all the open water activities. So, I think it's prudent to stick with our buy first quarter 2020 for now until everything shows up in theater and you start the open water work.","John Abbott","Appreciated and his second question is on hedging. You're fully hedged on short for 2019 with $60 floor, but you've also said at $60 oil in the Bakken you can generate around $450 billion of free cash in 2020 at $60. Given that oil is trading above that level now. How should we think about your hedging strategy going forward? As it seems to us, you have a chance to draw an early line under any future cash burn.","Greg Hill","Thanks. So just like you said, we are well-positioned here for this year in 2019 with our hedges that are $95,000 barrels a day to put options at $60 WTI floor. So, we're comfortable and well positioned in 2019. To your point, it is our intention to add positions for 2020 obviously depending on market conditions. We do not have any 2020 positions on right now, but it is our intent to add that just like you said to draw that line in the sand, ensure that we have a strong cash flow next year, as we continue to invest in Guyana and Bakken.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer","I wanted to follow up on the topic of oil prices, maybe a little bit less on the hedging front, but more, if these oil prices hold likely higher relative to what was originally anticipated. Can you just talk about the strategy for use of excess cash and in terms of either returning to our shareholders paying down debt or investing in the business?","John Hess","Yes, Brian, our first priority as you know is to make sure we have a strong financial position and cash position to fund the first ship in Guyana, the second ship in Guyana and the six-week program we have in the Bakken. So, the strong cash position will be prioritized for investing in those high return projects.","Brian Singer","And then my follow is on Guyana. Can you just talk and compare and contrast? What you're seeing so far in the Tilapia, Yellowtail area with the strong thickness of pay in comparison to say what you see at Liza? I know there is a knowledge difference right now, but little bit of comparing contrast will be helpful.","John Hess","Now, I think the Yellowtail was a great result. It had high net to gross. As John mentioned in his opening remarks, 292 feet of that, well had good porosity and it has got good oily fluids that are Liza-like. So, Yellowtail is closer to Liza from a geologic standpoint. And so, we're very pleased with that result.","Brian Singer","And then, in Tilapia nearby?","John Hess","Tilapia, again, a very good well, 300 feet, very high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir, so we're also very pleased to that also. I think the key point here is both of those wells are great talk about are very oily. high quality oil, and really increase our confidence that the greater Turbot area should underpin the fourth and fifth FPSOs that are being contemplated.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Campbell","To that point, I just wanted to -- it's kind of asking some that was asked before, but I just want to ask it a different way. It appears that you may have actually discovered additional Guyana resources. It's beyond what might have been currently your mark for the development plan through 2025. And that may not be right, you can tell me, but I was wondering. If exploration success continues, could this potentially expand the plans into 2025%? Or is it more likely that it becomes longer dated oil?","John Hess","No, again, we're optimizing our plans. The first three ships are very much defined. The fourth and fifth ship, we still have more appraisal work to do. We're also looking at Hammerhead how that might fit in the queue. But since this is a phase development, it's very manageable from a financial perspective and very much aligned with the financial outlook we gave out to 2025 in our Investor Day in December.","Jeffrey Campbell","And I just want to turn quickly to North Malay when noted the output increase. I was under the impression we're already close to near peak that obviously wasn\u2019t the case. So, I was just wondering this future growth beyond what we saw in the first quarter expected at some point or the volumes getting near their new ceilings?","John Rielly","Really, what you saw in the first quarter were increased nominations above typical nomination, now the field as you could see, it has a capability of delivering that, but it really based on local demand. So, what I would say is, you should expect that that nominations come down. We're expecting that part of our second quarter forecast is to have some of that demand for the nomination come down a bit. But the field to your point is performing very well and has the availability to produce at a higher level, should the demand be there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Pavel Molchanov","I don\u2019t think anyone's asked you about the Midstream. You guys had a pretty sizable drop down. A few ago, if I\u2019m not mistaken, the largest dropdown since the MLP originally went public. What's kind of the expectation for additional dropdown beyond the organic expansion that I know you guys announced this morning?","Greg Hill","Yes, so, you're right. We did. In the first quarter, we sold our water business or dropped that down into the upper tier into the Midstream JV. So, that was complete in the first quarter and then also in the first quarter of Midstream did acquire some other North Dakota transportation assets from Summit Midstream partners. So, they did that. They've been busy. And as you know, you mentioned that we are expanding our Tioga Gas Plant from 250 million to 400 million scuffs.","So, there's a lot of activity and there is a lot of demand for our infrastructure of North Dakota. So, we're well-positioned for it and we're excited actually for the increase in the gas plant. As far as other assets, we do have other assets in North Dakota; and actually outside in North Dakota, we've talked about the Gulf of Mexico as well, that could be dropped in. So, we will continue to look at that and we will put assets into the Midstream overtime. But as of right now, nothing immediate I would tell you.","Pavel Molchanov","And when I look at the guidance for the Midstream tariff, starts at, you did 162 million in Q1, guiding to 170, so the implied rate for the second half of the year is about over 200 million per quarter. Is that right? And what explains the increase?","Greg Hill","So, we will have a significant -- begin to get significant increase of throughput capacity when the little Missouri four plant comes online. That is expected to come online in the third quarter. So, the Midstream will see and it's not just test, its third parties as well, utilizing our additional capacity at the little Missouri plant. So, it is just the throughput increase that will increase the tariff. Some of it'd been in Hess related and some of it'd be in third party.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Payne of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Ross Payne","Nice job guys across the board. Can you speak to the process to sanction Liza 2 in any governmental challenges you expect to get that sanctioned and permitted? And second of all, what's the latest news on the no-confidence vote? And does that have any impact on future permitting?","Greg Hill","I think I will talk to Phase 2 and John will speak to no-confidence vote. But on Phase 2, as we said in our opening remarks, the approval is eminent. So, we don't expect any issues.","John Hess","In terms of the no-confidence vote, as you probably are aware, the no-confidence vote was overturned in court. It's now going to a higher court to have that ruling upheld. We expect that to occur during the month of May and I can assure you. The current government is running their approval process in the normal course of business, and we don't see the no-confidence vote or the overturned of the no-confidence vote of having any impact in the day-to-day running of the Guyanese government and their oil affairs.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Candace and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay Wilson","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC.","Also, on today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and those most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to John Hess.","John Hess","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I\u2019ll provide an update on the steps we are taking in response to the low oil price environment and review highlights from 2015. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and John Rielly will review our financial results.","Three principles are guiding us through this lower-for-longer oil price environment. Preserve the strength of our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our long-term growth options. By adhering to this disciplined approach, we finished the year with one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions among our E&P peers, with $2.7 billion of cash, an undrawn $4 billion revolving credit facility that goes out to January 2020, and a net debt-to-capitalization ratio, excluding the Bakken Midstream joint venture of approximately 15%.","Our top priority in this challenging environment is to continue to keep our balance sheet strong. Yesterday, we announced a 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, 40% below our 2015 spend, and approximately 20% below the preliminary guidance we provided in late October of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. Our focus is on value not volume and we do not think it makes sense to accelerate production in the current price environment, particularly given the recent further deterioration in the oil markets.","For this reason we will reduce activity levels across our producing portfolio in 2016, both onshore and offshore, and will continue to pursue further cost reductions to preserve the strength of our balance sheet. Our 2016 production forecast remains the same as our previous guidance of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, even with roughly $600 million of additional cuts in capital spend from our previous guidance and the recent sale of our assets in Algeria in December, which contributed net production of 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2015.","In terms of our year-end reserves as a result of significant price driven negative revision and a corresponding reduction in activity levels, our proved reserves decreased year-over-year to 1.086 billion barrels of oil equivalent at year-end 2015. It is important to note that all of the decrease was in proved undeveloped category and that our proved developed producing reserves increased by approximately 4% versus 2014.","Now turning to our 2015 financial results, our adjusted net loss was $1.1 billion and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $1.9 billion. Compared to 2014, our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas sales volumes, which were more than offset by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher DD&A expense.","From an operational standpoint, 2015 was a year of outstanding performance with strong execution across the portfolio and we are very proud of the work our team has done in a difficult oil price environment. Actual production was 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus our October guidance of 370,000 to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","On a pro forma basis excluding Libya and asset sales, 2015 production increased by 18% compared to 2014 averaging 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus 311,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day the prior year on the same basis. Also during 2015, we delivered significant reductions in both capital expenditures and cash operating costs and achieved early success with our focused exploration program.","Turning to the Bakken, Hess has an industry-leading acreage position that is competitive with the best shale oil plays in the United States. Through the application of lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team has continued to drill some of the lowest cost and most productive wells in the play. Our 2016 focus is on the core of the core, where Hess has significantly more drilling spacing units or DSUs than any other competitor.","Maintaining a two rig program will help preserve our top quartile operating capabilities; so that we are positioned to efficiently increase activity when oil prices recover. Bakken production in 2015 averaged 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up approximately 35% from 2014. Despite dropping to two rigs, we continue to forecast Bakken production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.","On July 1, 2015 we closed on the Bakken Midstream joint venture, which resulted in total cash proceeds to Hess of $3 billion. Hess maintains operational control of these strategic assets giving us access to the best markets for our products through the flexibility that it offers. As previously announced, the joint venture plans to proceed with an initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP common units when market conditions improve.","In terms of developments, while we are significantly reducing investment across our base portfolio. We plan to continue to invest for future growth with two offshore developments. The first, North Malay Basin, is a long-life, low-risk natural gas resource with oil linked pricing. Hess is operator with a 50% interest. Full field development is on track for startup in 2017 after which the project is expected to add an incremental 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and become a long-term cash generator.","Our second offshore development Stampede is one of the largest undeveloped fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with estimated gross recoverable resources between 300 million and 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. Hess is the operator of Stampede and we have a 25% interest. Following startup in 2018, the project will add an incremental 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and become a material cash generator.","Turning to exploration, we are very pleased with the early results from our focused expiration program. Namely, the Exxon-operated Liza discovery, offshore Guyana, in which Hess has a 30% working interest. And the Chevron-operated Sicily discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess has a 25% working interest.","In particular, we believe that the Stabroek Block in Guyana has the potential to be very material to Hess and create significant long-term value for our shareholders even in a lower price environment. About 90% of a 17,000 square kilometers 3D seismic acquisition program has been completed.","In 2016, we plan to drill up the four wells to evaluate the Liza discovery, perform a drill stem test and explore additional prospects on the block. In summary we are well-positioned to navigate this lower-for-longer price environment and are taking a disciplined approach to preserve our financial strength competitively advantage capabilities and long-term growth options.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory Hill","Thanks John. I would like to provide an operational update on our progress in 2015 and our plans for 2016. As John mentioned 2015 was a year of strong execution across our portfolio. Production averaged 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the top end of our October guidance of 370,000 to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter, production averaged 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day exceeding our October guidance of 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the same quarter.","In 2015, we also reduce capital and exploratory expenditures by $400 million during the year and cash operating cost by more than $300 million. We continued to drive down our drilling and completion costs and successfully conducted tighter spacing and increased stage count pilots in the Bakken. We also achieve material exploration success in Guyana and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico were the Liza and Sicily wells were ranked as the two largest oil discoveries of 2015 by both Wood Mackenzie and IHS.","Clearly 2015 was a challenging year in terms of oil prices and we believe it is prudent to manage the business assuming that prices remain lower for longer. On that basis we announced yesterday a 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, which is 40% below 2015 levels and will result in significant reductions in activity levels across our unconventionals and offshore business.","Year-end 2015 proved reserves were significantly impacted by the price environment with the addition of 84 million barrels of oil equivalent offset by price related downward revisions of 282 million barrels of oil equivalent. Year-end proved reserves accounting for the sale of our Algeria asset, were 1.086 billion barrels of oil equivalent of which 73% proved developed.","Nonetheless, the notable early success of our exploration program and continued technical advances in our unconventionals business have allowed us to materially grow our total resource base. In 2016, we forecast companywide production to average between 330,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","This forecast is unchanged from preliminary guidance provided on our last quarterly conference call despite the further 20% reduction in our capital and exploratory expenditures. In the first quarter of 2016, we forecast companywide production to average between 340,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Turning to operations, the Bakken continued to deliver outstanding performance as well as higher upside. We exceeded our production targets continued to substantially reduce our well cost through the continued application of lean manufacturing techniques, significantly improved our well IP rates through the successful testing of 50-stage sliding sleeve fracs, an industry first in the Bakken, and increased our well inventory and estimated ultimate recovery through infilling to tighter spacing, using a nine and eight configuration.","Full year production in the Bakken averaged 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 35% above 2014 and above our guidance from the beginning of the year of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter as a result of lower drilling activity net production average 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day up 7% from the year ago quarter.","Lean manufacturing practices enabled us to once again significantly drive down our Bakken drilling and completion costs with the fourth quarter averaging $5.1 million per well versus $7.1 million per well in the year ago quarter, a reduction of 28%.","Looking forward, we expect drilling and completion costs in 2016 to remain near this level, even though we will increase stage counts by approximately 40% as we move from our standard 35-stage design to a 50-stage design. The 50-stage trials conducted in 2015 have been very successful delivering more than a 20% average increase in IP30, 60 and 90.","Our tighter well spacing pilots in 2015 have also been successful. Results to date confirm that moving from 13 wells to 17 wells per DSU is value accretive in the core of the play enabling us to add 200 new drilling locations to our inventory. Additional pilots will be required in the future to fully understand applicability across all of our acreage which to some degree will be a function of price.","The combination of our successful infill pilot and overall stronger type curve performance has allowed us to increase our estimated ultimate recovery from the Bakken to 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from our previous estimate of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent.","Our industry-leading Bakken position continues to provide a forward well inventory that has one of the lowest breakevens in the play. However, in the current pricing environment, we believe it is prudent to reduce drilling until oil prices recover. With this in mind, in 2016, we intend to reduce our activity to two rigs at the end of February compared to an average of 8.5 rigs in 2015 and 17 rigs in 2014.","Our 2016 capital budget for the Bakken is $425 million approximately a 70% reduction from 2015. We plan to drill approximately 50 wells and bring approximately 80 new wells online in 2016 compared to 219 new wells online in 2015. Despite this significant reduction in well activity, we forecast Bakken net production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and also in the first quarter of 2016.","Moving to the Utica. In 2015 the joint venture drilled 24 wells and brought 32 new wells on production. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter. Net production for the year in the Utica averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2014.","In 2015 by applying the same lean manufacturing techniques that we use in the Bakken. We reduced drilling and completion costs by 30%, down to $9.6 million per well from $13.7 million per well in 2014. Despite the high quality of our acreage position and low 5% average royalty, the joint venture intends to lay down the one rig we have operating at the end of the first quarter of 2016 given low natural gas and NGL prices and wide basin differentials. In 2016, we plan to drill five wells and bring 14 new wells online. Production is forecast to average between 20,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.","Turning to our offshore operations, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we commenced remediation work at our Tubular Bells field in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator. This work includes acid jobs at two wells and opening a stuck subsurface safety valve at another well. The field produced approximately 20,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and we forecast that the remediation work will allow production to increase to approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2016.","In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, production average 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. In response to low prices, the operator plans a very minimal amount of activity in 2016. Full-year net production is expected to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.","At the South Arne Field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest we expect to complete the current phase of development drilling and release the rig at the end of the first quarter. Net production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and is expected to average approximately 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.","In Equatorial Guinea, where we are operator with an 85% interest we recently completed the acquisition of new 40 seismic. Processing of this seismic is underway and the early data indicates additional infill production and water injection well opportunities that can be pursued when oil prices recover. Net production averaged 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015.","Looking forward production is expected to decline over 2016 reflecting a continuation of the drilling pause that has been in place since mid-2015. At the Malaysia Thailand joint development area and the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess has a 50% interest. Work continues on the booster compression project, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter.","Further drilling activity will not be required to meet contracted volumes for the next couple of years as a result of the compression project. Net production average 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and is expected to be approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 reflecting planned downtime associated with the booster compression project and lower PFC entitlements due to lower capital expenditure.","We continue to progress our North Malay Basin and Stampede developments, which remain on target to come on-stream in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Net North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator. The first two wells of the development drilling campaign have reached total depth and are fully in line with pre-drill expectations.","Net production averaged approximately 40 million cubic feet per day through the early production system in 2015 and is expected to stay at this level through 2016. Following completion of the full field development project in 2017 net production is planned increased to 165 million cubic feet per day.","At the Stampede development in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator we successfully completed installation of piles, started setting equipment on the top side and made good progress on the whole in 2015.","Looking forward in 2016 we aim to complete the top sides main deck begin offshore installation of the whole block and install the subsea systems. Development drilling will commence in 2016 and first oil remains targeted for 2018.","Moving to exploration. In the Gulf of Mexico following the success of the Sicily-1 discovery well, in which Hess holds a 25% interest. The operator Chevron has commenced drilling the Sicily-2 appraisal well to delineate a large four-way closure in the outboard Paleogene. The operator expects to reach target depth during the second quarter of 2016.","Also in the Gulf of Mexico we are participating in a ConocoPhillips operated prospect called Melmar, in which Hess has a 35% interest. The lower price environment has enabled access to high-quality longer-term offshore prospects at attractive entry costs. Melmar is a good example of this and fits well with our strategy. It is one of the last large Paleogene four-way prospects in the prolific Perdido trend.","Drilling operations began in December and the operator expects to reach total depth in the second quarter of 2016. In Guyana for the Liza-1 well accounted 295 feet of high-quality oil bearing reservoir. The operator Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited is planning to evaluate the Liza discovery and test the further potential of the Stabroek Block, in which Hess has a 30% interest. The next well, Liza-2 is planned to spud later in the first quarter.","In closing, despite the challenging price environment 2015 was a year of excellent execution and delivery across our business which is a tribute to the outstanding people of Hess. Our strategy is to continue protecting our balance sheet, while maintaining our core capabilities and growth options.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John Rielly","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2015. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $396 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $291 million in the third quarter of 2015.","On a GAAP basis, the corporation incurred a net loss of $1.821 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with a net loss of $279 million in the previous quarter. The fourth quarter results contained non-cash charges of $1.359 billion resulting from the low commodity price environment including the write-off of our E&P segment goodwill of $1.98 billion. The non-taxable goodwill charge was allocated in our financial results to U.S. and international operations.","In addition, fourth quarter exploration expenses include $178 million after-tax for the write-off of previously capitalized gas wells in Guyana, three previously capitalized wells in Australia that are not included in the most recent development concept and the impairment of certain leasehold costs in the Gulf of Mexico. In the United States we also recognized an impairment charge of $83 million after-tax associated with our legacy conventional North Dakota assets.","In connection with the sale of Hovensa\u2019s assets and completion of its bankruptcy has agreed to assume obligations under the Hovensa pension plan and relinquish our rights to receive any proceeds from financing provided to Hovensa during bankruptcy in exchange for the release of all claims from the Virgin Islands government that were asserted against us. Our fourth quarter results include charges of $41 million after-tax for the cost of the pension obligations amounts funded in the quarter and legal fees.","Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred losses of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a loss of $221 million in the third quarter of 2015. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2015 were as follows.","Lower sales volumes reduced results by $46 million. Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $33 million. Higher exploration expenses reduced results by $21 million. All other items net to a reduction in results of $7 million for an overall reduction in fourth quarter adjusted results of $107 million.","In the fourth quarter, our E&P operations were under-lifted compared with production by approximately 1 million barrels, which did not have a material impact on fourth quarter results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 38% for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the benefit of 47% in the third quarter. On an unadjusted basis the fourth quarter effective tax rate reflects the fact the goodwill impairment charge did not have an associated tax benefit.","Turning to Midstream. Fourth quarter net income of $11 million was down versus third quarter net income of $16 million, primarily due to lower volume throughput at the Tioga gas plant as a result of unplanned downtime and increase crude export via pipeline in response to market differentials. Bakken midstream EBITDA excluding the non-controlling interest amounted to $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $79 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses excluding items affecting comparability were $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $86 million in the third quarter of 2015.","Turning to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter including an increase of $401 million from changes in working capital was $623 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $935 million. Net borrowings were $93 million, common stock dividends paid were $72 million, other net amounted to a use of cash of $6 million resulting in a net decrease in and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $297 million.","Excluding amounts held in our Bakken Midstream joint venture we had approximately $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015, compared to $3 billion at September 30, 2015. Total debt excluding Bakken Midstream was $5.9 billion at December 31, 2015 and our debt to capitalization ratio was 24.4%. In addition we have a committed $4 billion revolving credit facility that is undrawn.","Turning to 2016 guidance, we project cash cost for E&P operations to be in a range of $15 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2016 and $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel for the full-year 2016 down from 2015 cash cost of $15.69 per barrel. The first quarter cash cost include well workover cost at the Tubular Bells Field. DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2016 is forecast to be $29 to $30 per barrel and $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel for the full-year of 2016, up from 2015 DD&A of $28.14 per barrel.","This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs of $44 to $46 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 and $43 to $45 per barrel for the full-year of 2016 compared with 2015 E&P unit operating costs of $43.83 per barrel. The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.55 to $3.65 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2016 and $3.55 to $3.95 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full-year of 2016, up from 2015 Midstream tariffs of $3.28 per barrel.","Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs and items affecting comparability, are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $260 million to $280 million for the full-year 2016 down from $338 million in 2015. The E&P effective tax rate excluding Libya is expected to be a differed tax benefit in the range of 41% to 45% for the first quarter and full-year of 2016 versus a benefit of 45% in 2015.","Turning to Midstream, in 2016 we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter and in the range of $40 million to $50 million for the full-year.","Turning to Corporate and Interest, in 2016 we estimate corporate expenses net of taxes to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million in the first quarter and in the range of $110 million to $120 million for the full-year. We estimate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the first quarter of 2016 and in the range of $205 million to $215 million for the full-year 2016.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate","Hi, good morning everybody.","John Hess","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate","First, I've got a couple, if I may. First question is to John Rielly. John, the cash flow number you gave was net of working capital, but can you X the working capital gain, cash flow looked a bit light. Can you walk us through what has gone on with particularly deferred tax and any other unusual items that explained that number? And then I have got a couple of exploration follow-ups, please.","John Rielly","Sure. In the fourth quarter we did have some special charges in the fourth quarter and some of them do have a cash flow impact. So they are impacting what a normal run rate would be in the fourth quarter. So the first part of that in the E&P charges are for surplus materials and supplies just due to reduced drilling plans so that was approximately $25 million in the quarter that was reducing cash flow, that $221 million.","And then also we had lower cost of market in the fourth quarter of approximately $40 million. So those two right there, from a special charges aspect, gets you about $65 million kind of a nonrecurring impact in the quarter. And then there's a couple of other things, one from the specials outside of E&P is for Hovensa.","So part of the charge relates to the relinquishment of proceeds that we provided during bankruptcy plus we get legal fees in there. So that was approximately $20 million in the quarter again reducing cash flow from operations. And then on an operating standpoint, you probably saw you noticed our exploration costs were up in the quarter just from a run rate standpoint it was in line with our full-year guidance, but in the fourth quarter we had higher seismic approximately $20 million to $25 million in the quarter.","So again from a recurring type standpoint it's just impacting at lower cash flow in the fourth quarter. And then the last thing you heard, I did mention there was a 1 million barrel under lift. So even though that had from a results standpoint not much of an impact, it does have a cash flow impact in the quarter.","And so you are ranging that $10 million to $15 million for that under lift. So all told, it is about $125 million when you add those numbers up kind of reducing the cash flow from operations in the quarter.","Doug Leggate","That makes a ton of sense, makes - reconciles the number. Thanks, John. My follow-up, to the extent you can answer on two non-operated exploration wells, I mean clearly exploration is getting no quarter with the market right now. But these looked like to John comments, look like they could be pretty material.","So Greg, first of all on Melmar, could you walk us through the genesis of how you got that in this market, spending additional capital on exploration might seem surprising to some. So what is the genesis of your entry there to the extent you can talk about the prospect? My understanding is this is a $2 billion to $4 billion oil-in-place target. I mean are those numbers right? And how would you risk it? I've got a follow-up on Liza, please.","Gregory Hill","Yes, so on Melmar. Let me just open Doug. Of course we are in a long-term business and we need to both think about today and tomorrow, so and one of the things we\u2019re seeing is this low price environment has created a lot of opportunities to access very high-quality longer-term growth options at very competitive entry cost. So Melmar is a great example of that.","Melmar, if you look at it it\u2019s a very large four-way on the proven prolific Perdido trend. So we farmed into a 35% working interest position at all eight blocks covered by the structure. I think importantly, it\u2019s one of the last undrilled large Paleogene four ways in the Perdido trend and therefore has a very high chance of geologic success.","The second thing about it, it's got a water depth of about 5,200 feet now that's compared to 7,900 feet at Great White. And so that what that means is it has higher projected reservoir pressures compared to Great White. The development costs could be significantly lower, given the shallower depth, and importantly the rock properties across the impermeability and deliverability are also going to be likely be the best in the Perdido trend. So when you look at the prospect, it was one of these really quality prospects that you could get in at very low entry cost. So that's why we get it.","Doug Leggate","Okay. My final one, if I may, is also on exploration, Greg. And again, I realize Exxon is the operator. So the constraints that puts around you. But you did put $70 million in your budget for predevelopment. I'm just wondering what that means. Again, you hit rock quality with Melmar, but we\u2019re hearing that the rock quality in Liza could be kind of off the charts.","So if you could give some color there and maybe some idea as to what an early production system might look like, acknowledging that it is only one well and perhaps we are getting a little bit over our skis, but any color you can provide, it would be helpful. Thanks.","Gregory Hill","Yes, I think, so first of all the rock property is fantastic. Very good porosity, very good permeability for deepwater at this depth, it is truly almost an outlier in that respect. Regarding the early production system we have money in our budget to begin looking at the development options, obviously the development options will be depended upon what you figure out in the appraisal program. So other than that we can't really be specific because it depends on what we find in the appraisal program, so but very good, very exciting Guyana province here.","Doug Leggate","Are you prepared to give us a scale on the discovery yet, Greg?","Gregory Hill","I can\u2019t yet, you\u2019ll have to ask the operator about that.","Doug Leggate","I think that would be the answer. All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Edward Westlake","Good morning gentlemen. Just the market obviously, with the low strip prices, is very focused on outspend. Obviously you\u2019re spending 820 on the two developments and when they come on-stream, you will get the cash flow from that. That\u2019s pretty obvious. But in terms of the next wave of spending around Guyana or the lower treasury. I am just trying to get a sense of are there any sort of lease terms which might force you into spending money, even if the oil price stays low? I am trying to get a sense of a way of asking 2017 exploration spend and development spend and maybe a trajectory into 2018.?","John Rielly","Sure, Ed. The way we look at it in and obviously as Greg said, Guyana is an exciting opportunity for us and you kind of laid it out with North Malay Basin coming on-stream in 2017 turning into a cash generator and then Stampede following in 2018. We don't really see any significant developments spend coming our way from Guyana in 2017 and 2018.","We see further exploration spending coming in. So the bigger development spend will be coming in fitting nicely into our portfolio as North Malay Basin and Stampede come up. So I can\u2019t really give you any specific guidance, but that's how we think about the spending going over the next couple of years.","Edward Westlake","Okay. And then just on the Bakken, obviously with two rigs, it feels like you\u2019re going to be drawing down some undeveloped - sorry, drilled but uncompleted inventory. Maybe just an update as you roll - if you rolled a two-rig program out into 2017, what the impact would be on Bakken production.","John Rielly","Yes, I think Ed, with the two-rig program we feel pretty confident we can hold production in that range of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels a day through 2016. If you think about how that trajectories going to unfold those throughout 2016, it\u2019s going to start the year at the high-end of the range and it\u2019s going to be end the year at the lower end of the range. So if you fast-forward to 2017 and set I held two rigs through 2017 obviously you would see some decline year-on-year, you can't hold it flat for more than a year with two rigs.","Edward Westlake","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Cheng","Thank you. Hey gentlemen, good morning.","John Hess","Good morning.","Paul Cheng","Greg, just curious then I mean just three months ago when you were talking about the guidance of the budget was a four rig program for Bakken, we talking about 95,000 to 105,000 and now with the two-rigs. Over the last three months, then, what may have changed that to make you increase the confidence that only two-rig and you actually also drop the number of well going to be on-stream next year from 100 to 80, but you keep the guidance to be the same. You said just that three months ago the guidance, you actually feel like you could be able to reach the high end. And now it is more like in the middle or in the lower end. Just trying to understand.","Gregory Hill","Okay, thanks Paul. Really there is four factors. So first of all the two-rig program is really focused in the core of the core with the higher EURs and IP rate. I think the second factor is we\u2019ve increased the stage count from 35 being our standard design to 50-stage fracs as our standard. And if you look at the impact of the 50 stage design we are seeing about a 20% increase in IP 30, 60 and 90. So obviously that's going to carry through.","I think the third thing is we are going to have increased gas and NGL capture in the plant as the Hawkeye south of the river system comes on in the third quarter of the year. And then the last is just increased drilling efficiencies. So further reductions in the spud-to-spud base. So it\u2019s really all four of those factors add up to you can still hold the range even with the two-rig program.","Paul Cheng","And Greg, looked like the $600 million cut from the previous guidance, $300 million appears to be from the major projects. Because I thought previously you are talking about $1.5 billion in the major projects and now it is about $1.2 billion. Are you including the exploration or appraisal during Guyana and northern? Where is that $300 million has been reduced from?","John Rielly","Paul, I can answer this even - I guess maybe just a little bit more broadly. But of that $600 million about half of it is due to cost-saving. So we are seeing further cost savings from the numbers that that we had provided in October. So we\u2019re getting about $300 million there across and some of it is in the development project, some of it is in our existing assets. And then the other half, like reducing to the two rigs in the Bakken is due to deferral of activity.","Paul Cheng","I see. And then, John, since that you are here, Algeria that the offset sales, have you already closed before the end of the year? In other words, is the money already in your balance sheet or that we should expect that in the first quarter? And if it is, how much is that?","John Rielly","So the actual transaction did close right before year-end. However, we have not received the cash yet. That will be coming in the first quarter. The contract though is confidential I can't give you the number on that. But it is not a significant amount.","Paul Cheng","So when you say not a significant, you say it means less than 100?","John Rielly","You can estimate that Paul. Yes.","Paul Cheng","Okay, that's fine. And I just want to clarify. I have to apologize that when you speak, I - John, you can correct me maybe. You're saying that the cash at the end of the year, excluding the Bakken, John mentioned is $2.3 billion or did I get that number wrong?","John Rielly","Right. No, you did. It is $2.7 billion sorry Paul.","Paul Cheng","$2.7 billion.","John Rielly","Yes, $2.7 billion.","Paul Cheng","Perfect. Thank you.","John Rielly","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Asit Sen of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Asit Sen","Thanks, good morning. A couple of questions, if I may, on the cost structure. Historically, when looking at the Bakken, Greg, I think you have mentioned OpEx per barrel a split of 40% variable, 60% fixed, but the variable costs should benefit from the lower energy component. But there could be several moving parts in the fixed component, particularly as relates to lower field personnel costs. Could you update us on that? So that's number one.","Number two: on DD&A per barrel, that number should also trend lower over the medium term. Could you discuss sort of the potential trajectory? And third, on the cost structure, Stampede first oil expected in 2018. I know the rigs have been contracted. What percent of the project cost is yet to be committed?","Gregory Hill","Okay I will try to answer all three of you. So the first one, you are focusing on the Bakken but it does apply across the portfolio that we do have high you know I mean there is a good amount of the costs that are fixed and so obviously we are trying to attack the fixed cost in this low-price environment as well as the variable costs and making sure we get all the variable costs out as we reduce activity.","So we have been seen from let\u2019s just pick the Bakken on our cash cost per barrel we\u2019ve been seen significant reductions like if you go back from the first quarter of 2014 through the fourth quarter of 2015. We've been seen significant cost reductions on our cash cost per barrel. And you probably heard when I gave the 2016 guidance we are giving guidance that our cash cost per barrel are going down in 2016 and that\u2019s with a reduction from 368,000 barrels a day pro forma production down to our 3.30 to 3.50.","So we are trying to stay up with especially in this low oil price environment reducing fixed costs and variable costs and so we are attacking both of them. As far as DD&A from a trajectory standpoint, you heard from our guidance actually our DD&A was going up in 2016 and that it's directly related to the reserves.","So you heard the reserves are going down from the price revisions so with those lower reserve amounts that's going to increase our DD&A up as prices recover, then those reserves will come right back on the book. And so in a normal environment what would be happening say in the Bakken as we continue to add reserves through our performance in additional drilling and now that we\u2019ve got all the infrastructure spend kind of behind us our DD&A would be going down over time. As far as Stampede, and I\u2019m going to hand it back to Greg for that.","Gregory Hill","Yes, so thanks for that. Stampede, if you look at it most of the costs have already been committed, but we have taken advantage of the lower price and service environment and actually got some savings from Stampede. As we put in our capital press release yesterday, we will spend about $325 million in 2016 in Stampede.","Asit Sen","Great, that is very helpful. And then just a follow-up on Guyana, could you talk about well costs? I know Liza was probably less than $80 million, I think you mentioned. And could you remind us of the environment, water depth, et cetera if you could?","Gregory Hill","Yes, so you're right Liza was less than $80 million net to us. Regarding future well costs, you are going to have to refer to the operator. What I will say is obviously the appraisal wells will be higher cost, because we\u2019re doing lots of testing and coring and the normal things that you would do in the appraisal part of the program.","Asit Sen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open.","David Heikkinen","Good morning guys. I have one high level question and one kind of lower level, what do you expect your year-end 2016 cash to be?","John Rielly","Okay, David that\u2019s - let me go through, I\u2019ll tell you how I think you should be looking at 2016. So we finished the year as you know with $2.7 billion of cash and obviously we\u2019re going to have cash flow from operations in 2016. So as we just released yesterday, you saw our capital spend program is estimated to be $2.4 billion in 2016. In that $2.4 billion is approximately $200 million of exploration cash spend, like seismic and G&A that\u2019s part of cash flow. So we have to fund capital expenditures of $2.2 billion and we have our dividend of approximately $285 million, let me just round that to $300 million.","So our capital and our dividend is going to be $2.5 billion in 2016. We have a cash balance at the end of 2015 of $2.7 billion. So effectively we can fund our capital program and our dividend out of our cash balance and still have $200 million left over at the end of 2016 and obviously we still have the revolver undrawn.","So then with that $200 million left from the cash account, David I am going to give you some work to do here. Because now you have to estimate what the cash flow from operations are going to be in 2016 and that depends on your commodity price assumption. So we\u2019ve given you the production guidance, the cash cost guidance and whatever cash flow from operations that you then come to you can add to that $200 million and that\u2019s where we will sit. So we are in a good liquidity position coming into this year and I think that's how you have to look at 2016.","David Heikkinen","Yes, you did not want to fill in the blank that I was looking for. That is fair enough. On the other side, Greg, the new stage count is pretty impressive. And then you are coming up. So just trying to get an idea of 2016 Bakken development. Do you have any idea of what 30, 60, and 90-day rates would be? Just round numbers would be helpful on a BOE basis.","Gregory Hill","I think we have given guidance before and we\u2019ll be at the upper end of that range obviously because we are in the core of the core of the Bakken. So our previous guidance will be in the high-end of the range.","David Heikkinen","Yes, it just seemed like you are double dipping with the new wells and core of the core that it would have been even above that range, potentially.","Gregory Hill","It will be. Once you had the 50-stage fracs, so we need to update our guidance once we get over entirely.","David Heikkinen","Okay, perfect. Overall that through, too and then just net-net of everything, what is your Bakken net back expected to be in the first quarter?","John Rielly","So we never really try to forecast because it\u2019s so difficult quarter-to-quarter, so in the fourth quarter we were - the Bakken was getting between $6 and $7 under TI and again the economics are right now favoring more to pipe then rail.","Gregory Hill","Yes, about 75% of our volume now is on pipe and the clear book differential that goes into that $6 number that John was just talking as a discount to WTI just maybe 250 refineries and turnarounds so that number was about 150 before. So there's a lot of dollar weakness now, but refineries come back on we expect that to recover.","David Heikkinen","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.","Guy Baber","Good morning everybody.","Gregory Hill","Good morning.","Guy Baber","You all have consistently mentioned that preserving your operating capability is a key objective for the Company. And that is the strategic question for me, particularly in the Bakken. But can you talk about striking that balance between cutting CapEx and rigs to protect the balance sheet versus preserving your capability so that you can respond in a timely manner when you get the appropriate oil price signal. Is that a concern for you guys with two rigs running? And is it a concern for you all for the industry at large in the Bakken from what you can see?","Gregory Hill","Thanks for that question. It is striking the balance and I think with our budget and operating two-rigs in the Bakken, we think we've achieved the right balance. So we\u2019re doing creative things with doubling up people and moving them over to special assignments and all at, making sure that they're ready for the inevitable ramp-up that will come in the Bakken.","Guy Baber","Okay, thanks. And then my follow-up is on the committed CapEx going forward, thinking through 2017 and 2018, we know that major project spending, long lead time, obligations are falling off over the next few years. But can you give us any specific indications as to how much decline in 2017 - is the majority of the North Malay Basin CapEx in 2016, you're not going to have that spending commitment in 2017? Or is that more of a 2018 event? Just trying to get a better sense there as I think it would help us better appreciate and understand the evolution of the free cash flow profile in a flat oil price environment, which is an important consideration.","John Rielly","Sure, so from a commitment standpoint what we\u2019d be looking at over the next couple of years is to complete North Malay Basin, to complete Stampede and obviously continue the exploration that we have going on in particular in Guyana. So in 2017, the North Malay Basin will be coming online so we have $375 million in the budget this year that is essentially reducing our free cash flow by that $375 million.","Now, we don't have exactly what the budget will be for North Malay Basin next year as far as pure capital, but it will be considerably lower than the $375 million, but again no matter what that number is it will be generating free cash flow. So as you look to 2017 you will get an improvement of free cash flow just related to North Malay Basin of $375 million.","And then again you follow-on that with Stampede so you have $325 million this year not generating free cash flow. Again we don't have the budget set for 2017. I don't expect it to be that different in 2017 as you move forward with Stampede and so it won't be until 2018 that you\u2019ll turnaround that $325 million of free cash flow.","Guy Baber","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Evan Calio","Hey guys, good morning guys. Just to start off with a follow-up to a prior cash question. What do you guys consider the minimum operating cash limits on the balance sheet? And I realize on most of the math that you supplied before on the call, you can currently support the dividend, given your balance sheet strength. How do you consider the dividend strategy in the context of the constrained cash flow environment? And the amount or the breadth of longer-term investment opportunities that you have as you navigate 2016?","John Rielly","Sure Evan. So again, as we go through that, I mean we are just on a good position probably relative to our competition with this $2.7 billion of cash. We don't need any cash flow from operations to fund our capital program, as I mentioned of $2.2 billion, plus the dividend if I round up to $300 million. So we can fund that completely out of our cash account and have $200 million left over in there.","And there will be, if you want to sit at a minimum level you are somewhere around that, say at the $200 million that you want to at least keep in our system between the U.S. and internationally. But again we don't even need any cash flow from operations just to repeat that to fund the capital or dividend.","So anything again as your estimate for cash flow from operations will just get added to that cash balance. We won't be near this any minimum levels as it relates to cash.","Evan Calio","Yes, that makes sense. And I have a couple smaller follow-up items. Can you give a cost or EUR uplift from the 50-stage Bakken completions versus the 35-stage design?","Gregory Hill","Yes, so if you look at 2015 particularly at the back half of year when we had a lot of 50-stages coming online. We were at the top end of our guidance range so the 550 to 650 we were at the very top end of that. We average 650 for the whole year in 2015. And as we drill on the core of the core you know next year and do the 50-stage fracs we expect to be in the high-600 to the mid-700 range.","So you're seeing that uplift, also on the IP rates you could see a similar sort of effect I mean the range we've given on the IP rate is 800 to 950 and obviously with 50-stage fracs on the IP rate you're going to be up there. One another point I want to make about you know the well costs on the Bakken. The well costs for the fourth quarter averaged $5.1 million per well, which is about a 28% reduction from the year ago and 4% reduction from Q3 again that lean manufacturing machine just continuing to work.","We said that we expect cost next year to be broadly flat at that $5 million to $5.1 million per well level. But of course that math, the significant amount of ongoing improvement because embedded in that number of the $5.1 million is the 40% increase in stage count. So we expect to fully offset that increased cost due to the higher stage count with continued lean manufacturing gain. So again, a 20% uplift in production for basically the same cost is what you have this year. So obviously that's going to be good for returns.","Evan Calio","And then I guess a similar spud to spud - I think it was an 18 day, or is that what that number is? We should assume?","Gregory Hill","Yes, it will improve again next year I mean this year we averaged about 22 wells per rig during the year that's going to increase to say, 24 or so next year.","Evan Calio","Great. And then lastly for me, a small one. If you can share what you booked on North Malay expansion 2016, just so I know how much of that project value is potentially reflected in your reserve numbers?","John Rielly","Oh no, that was not - there was no addition to our reserves in 2015 for the North Malay Basin expansion.","Evan Calio","Can you give us a number of what that - what is in there - what is in your - what you've booked or what you have as PUDs there?","John Rielly","Okay, so what we have for North Malay Basin and this is kind of you get to this unique reserve accounting of rules because we don't - during 2015 we did not have a significant amount of wells in the ground that we could book proved reserves on and as Greg mentioned we started the drilling program more - now ticking it off in 2016 to drill up the reservoirs.","We didn't have that significant of reserves say initially. And then when you run it through the reserve accounting requirements because those proved reserves are low compared to the gas sale contract we can't book the reserves here in 2015. So what will happen is as Greg\u2019s team just drills out in 2016, we\u2019ll actually begin booking the reserves at North Malay Basin.","Evan Calio","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I will follow-up offline.","John Rielly","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer","Thank you and good morning.","John Hess","Good morning.","Brian Singer","I wanted to follow up on some of the Guyana questions. You mentioned that the early production system depends on the appraisal program. Can you talk more specifically about what you expect to learn with the Liza-2? And then the same kind of question for how the next three wells that you are drilling and planning this year differ and what the learnings could be from those wells as well.","Gregory Hill","Yes, I think so let's talk about Liza appraisal first. I mean we want to get a dynamic test that will tell us about potential compartmentalization in Liza. We also want to find where the contact is so that will be the primary two objectives of the appraisal wells in Liza.","The exploration wells are basically the objective there is to figure out what we are seeing on seismic, is that replicable in other areas of the block, because we have a lot of look-alikes on seismic. So we want to get a well or two in a couple of the other things and see what running room we have on the block. We think there's a lot, but obviously you'll need some more wells to figure that out.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks. And then my follow-up is with regards to M&A. You mentioned really going back a year valuations never really looked attractive from a consolidation perspective. And I wondered, A, if you could kind of comment on how those look now. And then B, recognizing that preserving balance sheet is one of your key objectives, is the opportunity set that you now see at Guyana and at Sicily so meaningful that it reduces your interest level and even considering shale consolidation?","John Hess","Look, a fair question on M&A. We always look at the outside to see if there are opportunities that will make our portfolios stronger, improve our economic opportunities for investment and also not sacrifice our balance sheet strength and while values have come down just to reiterate while our priority is first and foremost the strength of our balance sheet and obviously the companies really well positioned with our $2.7 billion of cash at the end of the year, one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions among our peers. We further strengthen that balance sheet by the further reduction in our spending for 2016 to the $2.4 billion number. We\u2019re talking about; it's about value not volume.","So the whole focus is the balance sheet and yet at the same time it's very important that the company, we are in a long-term business. Everybody is thinking short-term that we invest for future growth on a disciplined and focused basis and we feel we\u2019re extremely well positioned with the growth options that we have both in North Malay Basin and Stampede, but also obviously Guyana that the company is going to benefit quite a bit and our shareholders as well as oil prices recover ultimately with these growth options that we\u2019ve already assembled. So we feel pretty good about what we\u2019ve already captured and therefore M&A is very low on the priority list.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Roger Read","Good morning.","John Hess","Good morning.","Roger Read","I guess two questions, one on the Bakken in terms of the efficiencies. Do you continue to do testing in this environment or with the two-well program strictly we should think about it as development and maybe putting further efficiencies on a hold for now? Or it's a drive for further efficiencies?","Gregory Hill","No, I think part of lean manufacturing is every day you look for the next improvement. So in terms of piloting though I think we've done the infills nine and eight and very successful, 50-stage fracs been very successful. So those now will become our standard design obviously in the core of the core. But every day, we are looking for the next improvement right. So that that drive will continue, that will go on, and we are constantly trying to improve everything across our business there. And that\u2019s all part of the lean manufacturing philosophy.","Roger Read","Okay, thanks. And then as you think about and you mentioned earlier in the beginning of the call, opportunities in the deepwater you have been able to get in; others are struggling on the cash flow side. As you look at some of those partners and you think about taking these projects forward, either on an appraisal well or ultimately full development, if it works out that way, what sort of I guess roadblocks may we run into, where partners simply don't want to fund those next steps? And how do we - it has been a long time since we've had a downturn like this. How should we think about the workout of that process over time?","Gregory Hill","Well, certainly if you think about what we are in currently so Sicily, clearly Chevron wants to move forward or aligned to that on the appraisal. ConocoPhillips obviously moved forward with Melmar, Guyana moving forward with Exxon; Nova Scotia BP moving forward. So we don't really see any partner risk of people not wanting to move forward.","Regarding your question, in the opportunity space. There is a lot of opportunity out there, very good prospects, very low entry cost, but we are going to be extremely disciplined and it's going to have to be really good in order for us to even consider adding it to the mix. And Melmar was one example of something that was very good and we made the decision to get in, but we are going to be extremely disciplined and very selective on how we do that.","Roger Read","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Campbell","Thank you. The first question I wanted to ask was did I understand correctly that the reduced spending at North Malay and Stampede was largely on cost saving? And if so, can you indicate where, what sort of savings we are talking about? And also was I correct that the timelines to first oil are intact?","John Rielly","I\u2019ll start with the timelines to first oil are intact. When I was talking about cost savings, it was across the portfolio, we had a mix of that $600 million worth kind of a half of it was cost savings and a half of it was deferment of activity. So there is a mix on North Malay Basin and Stampede, it's not like that was all cost savings.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. And then thinking about - and staying on the theme of cost savings and the offshore, I was just wondering can you comment broadly about your current view of industry efforts to reduce offshore development costs? And specifically I am thinking of back when you said that Guyana looked great at $80 a barrel, but not as much at lower oil prices. Other than waiting for a higher future oil price, do you see developments unfolding that can make a play like Guyana better able to attract capital in a better, but still moderate oil price environment?","Gregory Hill","Yes, I think so I mean if you look at cost reductions if you look at the onshore I would say the progression of cost reductions in the onshore has been much more rapid than the offshore. For very practical reason the offshore fleet - there's still a lot of rigs on contract at relatively high prices. The yards are full, still full as you kind of look around the globe so we see that really opening up though as rigs come off contract in the offshore as the yards become not at capacity those costs are going to come down as well. It\u2019s just taking longer than the offshore because they are very busy.","So I think if you are developing something in that timeframe of 2017 or so I think you really get the full benefit of that. We are already seeing those benefits in Guyana with the rig rates that Exxon was able to get Guyana also the seismic boat rates that they were able to get Guyana. So you are starting to see some of that come through the value chain, but more they come on the offshore.","Jeffrey Campbell","And if I could just follow up on that a little bit further. I was also wondering, because I'm sure you are watching, do you see anything with regard to trends, like trying to standardize subsidy approaches, things on the engineering side that might suggest that you can drive costs down on that basis as well?","Gregory Hill","Yes, I think so. I think there is nothing like a low price for companies to get innovative and I know a lot of my service company colleagues in the major oil companies are all getting together talking about how can we better standardizes an industry to lower the overall cost structure of the industry. We are doing that in our developments, for example we are using a lot of the same things that came out of Tubular Bells and Stampede making sure there's not as much bespoke equipment that really tends to drive your cost up.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, that was very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Pavel Molchanov","Hey guys. You addressed the M&A question from the buy side. I guess maybe I\u2019ll try it from the sell side. You have been a net seller of assets for more than three years now. Has that pretty much run its course with the Algeria deal? Or are you still looking to monetize additional assets other than of course the Bakken MLP?","John Hess","A fair question. We will always look to optimize our portfolio you know in the normal course of business. So we will continue to take that approach.","Pavel Molchanov","Any particular geographies that come to mind?","John Hess","No.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay, all right. I will leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phillips Johnston of Capital One. Your line is now open.","Phillips Johnston","Hi, guys thanks. Just a follow-up on Ed's question earlier. On the declines on the Bakken, if we assume you continue to run two-rigs throughout this year and next. Can you give us an update on what sort of cushion you have on your MBCs if we just assume your operator production continues to decline and if we assume production from other operators also declines in the basin? You've got some incremental volumes I think coming in through the Hawkeye system, which should sort of help offset that. But can you just give us an update on your latest thinking there, and whether or not that is something that we should be concerned about?","John Rielly","First of all, no I guess is the answer on an overall basis, I just wanted to let you know in our supplement that is being posted we actually have the 2016 minimum volume commitments there, maybe I can just walk you through that from a processing standpoint this 2016 commitment is a 186 million scuffs a day. In the fourth quarter we\u2019re right at that 186 and as I mentioned earlier we had unplanned downtime in the third quarter we\u2019re up at 210 in the second quarter 202, don't see any issues with that with the two-rig program.","From the pipeline standpoint we gathered 50,000 barrels of oil per day and the commitment is 45 in 2016 and gas gathering was 198 in the fourth quarter and the minimal vol is 189 do not see an issue there. So the one small thing that we may see and we think it\u2019s under $10 million save to us, is going to be on our logistics on the rail. Because as we mentioned earlier the economics now are favoring more to the pipeline but obviously that can change.","So just from in the fourth quarter our terminal throughput was 62,000 barrels of oil per day the minimum volume commitment is 73,000 back in the second quarter we had 82 going through that terminal. But as far as the rail terminal crude loading, we were at 42,000 barrels a day the minimum volume coming is 38 and for rail services is 43,000 barrels a day for the minimum volume commitment and the fourth quarter was at 43,000.","So bottom line we do not expect any real issues from the minimum volume standpoint and the build-out for the Hawkeye south of the river will begin to add throughput back into the system for us.","Phillips Johnston","And just on that Hawkeye system, have you quantified what sort of incremental volumes you are expecting from that?","John Rielly","Yes, if you hold on one second I can give you we had not quantified per se what are the additional volumes that absolutely will be coming through, but I can give you capacity from the south of the river infrastructures so we are adding approximately 75,000 barrels a day from the oil standpoint and 50 million cubic feet per day from the gas compression. Now the project itself is also going to add interconnection points for the capture of third-party oil volumes into the midstream system as well.","Phillips Johnston","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Your line is now open.","John Herrlin","Yes, hi. Just some quick ones for me. With Melmar, did COP approach you or did you approach COP in terms of the farming?","Gregory Hill","It\u2019s been a joint thing; we\u2019ve been talking to each other for the last year and a half about Melmar.","John Herrlin","Okay, that's fine. With your PUD reductions, was it all price, or just some of it reduced activity?","Gregory Hill","Actually, it was both so if you look at the reductions as we mentioned in our opening remarks there were 282 million barrels of price related revision, 50 million of that was related to the Bakken five-year rule, so that\u2019s just purely reduced rig counts that push wells out of the five-year window so that was about 50 million barrels. The remaining 234 of that 282 is really across the portfolio, but it split about 60% Bakken and 40% offshore. So that kind of gives you a relative sense of where those movements were.","John Herrlin","Okay, great. Last one for me regarding the Bakken, you are increasing the number of stages. Are you changing the sand loadings at all? For your fracs?","Gregory Hill","Not really, although it does vary depending on where you are in the field. Typical sand loadings are anywhere from 75,000 to 100,000 pounds per stage, and just depending on where you are in the field we modify that based on the data.","John Herrlin","Okay. And what drove all decline rates? Still high 20s?","Gregory Hill","For the portfolio or what?","John Herrlin","For the Bakken portfolio, yes.","Gregory Hill","Well, I mean if you think about the - we averaged 112,000 barrels a day this year, the range is 95 to 105 so if you pick the middle that gives you a sense of how much the Bakken is going to decline year-on-year, right.","John Herrlin","Okay, all right. Thanks.","Gregory Hill","Okay. You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.

My name is Crystal, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Jay Wilson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President and Chief Operating Officer; John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will make some high-level comments on the quarter and the progress we are making in executing our strategy to become a pure play E&P company. Greg Hill will then discuss our E&P operations, and John Rielly will go over our financial results.","Net income for the third quarter of 2013 was $420 million or $405 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.18 compared to $1.46 in the year-ago quarter. Net production in the third quarter averaged 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 402,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in last year's third quarter.","Asset sales associated with our strategic portfolio reshaping accounted for 83,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of the decline. The remainder was primarily related to unplanned downtime in Libya, resulting from the civil unrest in that country and heavier-than-normal seasonal maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by higher production from the Bakken and Valhall.","Our plan is on track to build a higher-growth and lower-risk E&P portfolio, capable of delivering a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 5% to 8% off of our pro forma 2012 production base. This growth is underpinned by the Bakken in North Dakota, the Valhall Field in Norway, the North Malay Basin Project in Malaysia, the Tubular Bells Field in the Gulf of Mexico and the Utica Shale in Ohio.","Net production from the Bakken averaged 71,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 14% from the third quarter a year ago. Our full year 2013 production forecast for the Bakken remains 64,000 to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the third quarter, we continued to reduce Bakken well cost, which declined to $7.8 million, down 18% from a year ago.","In Norway, production from the Valhall Field ramped up strongly following completion of a multi-year field redevelopment in the first quarter. Net production averaged 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter versus 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter.","In Malaysia, we recently achieved first gas at the Hess-operated North Malay Basin Project. Net production is expected to reach 40 million cubic feet per day during the fourth quarter and remain at this level through 2016. Full field development is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day by 2017.","In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Hess-operated Tubular Bells development is on track to achieve first production in the third quarter of 2014 at a net rate of approximately 25,000 barrels per day.","In Ohio, delineation of the wet gas window of the Utica Shale will continue through 2014. Initial well results have been encouraging, and we expect to commence development in 2015.","Integral to our transformation to a focused pure play E&P company is our divestiture program, where we continue to make significant progress. In July, we announced the sale of our Energy Marketing business to Direct Energy for more than $1 billion. And earlier this month, we announced the sale of our Terminals business to Buckeye Partners for $850 million. In addition to proceeds from the Terminal sale, this transaction will free up approximately $900 million of working capital through inventory liquidation. We expect both transactions to close in the fourth quarter.","Year-to-date, we have announced or completed 6 of 10 planned divestitures with sales proceeds and the release of working capital totaling $6.3 billion. The remaining divestitures are well underway for our upstream assets in Indonesia and Thailand, as well as our Retail Marketing and Trading businesses.","Following the announcement of the sale of our Energy Marketing business at the end of July, we commenced our previously announced share repurchase program. Through October 29, we have repurchased 11.2 million shares for $882.7 million. Also in September, our annual dividend increased by 150% to $1 per share.","In closing, we are pleased with the progress we have made in our transformation to become a pure play E&P company and in the execution of our plan to reshape our portfolio. We are committed to continuing to review all options to optimize our portfolio and allocate capital to generate the highest financial returns for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory P. Hill","Thanks, John. I would like to provide a brief review of the progress we are making in executing our EP strategy. Starting with unconventionals. In the third quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 71,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was up 14% from the third quarter of 2012. As we indicated previously, our Bakken production ramps up in the second half of the year, as a result of the completion of our transition to pad drilling.","As previously disclosed, there will be planned downtime in the Bakken during the fourth quarter, as we complete the expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant. This downtime is incorporated into our 2013 Bakken production guidance, which remains 64,000 to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In terms of individual Bakken well performance, we remain focused on driving superior financial returns, which is a function of well cost, productivity and price realizations. Drilling and completion costs in the third quarter averaged $7.8 million per well versus $8.4 million in the previous quarter.","In addition, the productivity of our wells continues to be among the highest in industry. During the quarter, we brought 50 operated wells on to production, of which 30 were Middle Bakken and 20 were Three Forks. For the full year, we expect to bring approximately 170 wells on production, with 2\/3 targeting the Middle Bakken and 1\/3 targeting the Three Forks.","As a result of our continuing delineation in Three Forks, both the productivity and aerial extent of the formation has increased above our previous estimates. In addition, the results of our infill pilot programs and reservoir modeling have led us to believe both the Middle Bakken and Three Forks can be further downspaced. We believe that it will be economically attractive to increase the well count and the majority of our Middle Bakken acreage from 5 wells per 1,280 drilling -- acre drilling unit to 7.","Similarly in those areas where the Three Forks is perspective, we believe the well count can be increased from 4 wells per 1,280 acre drilling unit to 6. Over the next 12 months, we plan to install 17 well pads in this new configuration to obtain additional data before making a final decision to move to this tighter spacing. As we make further progress in our planning and field testing, we will provide updated guidance for production, drilling locations and resource potential.","Our Tioga rail facility ran at capacity in the third quarter, delivering an average of 54,000 barrels per day to higher-value markets. Our Tioga Gas Plant expansion project, which will increase wet gas input capacity from 120 million to 250 million cubic feet per day is on schedule to begin commissioning at the end of 2013, enabling us to capture more liquids and value from our own gas and from third parties.","In summary, we're on track to deliver our 2013 production and capital guidance for the Bakken, and we are increasingly confident about the long-term upside potential.","Turning to the Utica. The appraisal of our acreage continues, and we are encouraged by well results to date. In 2013, Hess and CONSOL expect to drill 25 wells across both our 100% owned and joint venture acreage. In the third quarter, we drilled 7 wells, completed 8 and flow tested 1 well.","On our 100% owned acreage, the Porterfield C 1H-17 well in Belmont County tested at a 24-hour rate of 3,421 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 21% liquids. Regarding exploitation, progress continues at Valhall, North Malay Basin and Tubular Bells. At the BP-operated Valhall Field in Norway, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. Full year 2013 net production from Valhall is forecast by the operator to be in the range of 24,000 to 28,000 barrels of oil per day, which we believe will come in at the lower end of this range.","At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, we completed the initial 5 development wells ahead of schedule and achieved first gas on October 11 from the early production system. Net production is expected to reach 40 million cubic feet per day during the fourth quarter and remain at this level through 2016. Full field development is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day by 2017.","At our 57% owned and operated Tubular Bells development in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our third production well was drilled during the quarter, and we are on track for field start up in the third quarter of 2014, delivering 25,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day of high-margin Gulf of Mexico production.","Of the 3 wells drilled to date, one came in as expected in terms of pay count, and the other 2 wells came in with substantially higher pay counts. As a result, we plan to now drill a fourth well to delineate the additional upside identified.","In terms of exploration in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block in Ghana, where Hess has a 90% working interest and is operator, we have opened a data room and expect to receive bids from potential partners later in the fourth quarter. Our appraisal plans are currently awaiting final approval from the Ghanaian government. Following approval of both the appraisal program and partnering arrangements by the Ghanaian government, we plan to issue guidance as to the resource potential on the block, as well as detail our appraisal program.","In Kurdistan, where Hess has a 64% working interest and is operator of the Shakrok and Dinarta blocks, we spudded the first of 2 planned exploration wells in August and anticipate spudding the second well in the fourth quarter.","In closing, our focus remains on executing our strategic plan to improve capital efficiency and deliver higher sustainable financial returns to our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thanks, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2013.","Corporation generated consolidated net income of $420 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared with $1,431,000,000 in the second quarter of 2013. Adjusted earnings, which exclude items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, were $405 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $520 million in the previous quarter.","Our third quarter earnings were reduced by approximately $105 million due to an underlift of production and downtime in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, higher DD&A and deferred taxes in the quarter resulted from increased production from the Valhall Field.","Turning to Exploration and Production. E&P had income of $455 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $1,533,000,000 in the second quarter. E&P adjusted earnings were $458 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $600 million in the previous quarter.","Second quarter income included a nontaxable gain of $951 million related to the sale of the corporation's 90% interest in its Russian subsidiary, Samara-Nafta. Third quarter and second quarter results included after-tax charges of $3 million and $18 million, respectively, for employees severance and exit cost.","Changes in the after-tax components of adjusted earnings between the second and third quarter were as follows. Lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $177 million. Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased earnings by $16 million. Lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $22 million. Lower cash costs increased earnings by $17 million. Changes in realized selling prices increased earnings by $8 million. All other items net to an increase in earnings of $4 million, for an overall decrease in third quarter adjusted earnings of $142 million.","Our E&P operations were underlifted compared with production by approximately 1.2 million barrels of crude oil in the third quarter, resulting in decreased after-tax income of approximately $30 million. The downtime for extended seasonal maintenance at non-operated fields in the Gulf of Mexico lowered production by approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and reduced third quarter income by approximately $75 million compared with the second quarter.","In addition, higher depreciation expense in the quarter reflected a greater production contribution from the Valhall Field, which has a higher DD&A rate per barrel than the portfolio average, resulting from a combination of the recently completed field redevelopment project to install the new production platform and prior acquisition cost.","While the higher DD&A rate and the high Norwegian tax rate lowers Valhall's net income per barrel contribution to the portfolio, Valhall's cash margin per barrel is accretive to the portfolio average, as we expect cash taxes to be deferred for the next several years.","The cash margin per barrel of the portfolio was $54 per barrel in the third quarter versus $51 in the second quarter, primarily due to higher realized prices, increased Valhall production and lower production from Libya. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, was 45% for the third quarter and 44% in the second quarter of 2013. The cash tax rate was 16% in the third quarter and 23% in the second quarter. This improvement in the cash tax rate was also driven by the change in production in Valhall and Libya.","We are updating our guidance as a result of the shut-in production in Libya. Libya's contribution to net income and cash flow is not material. However, the reduction in production will have the effect of increasing our unit cost and decreasing our tax rate. Our updated production guidance assumes no further contribution from Libya for the remainder of 2013 due to current civil unrest in the country.","In addition, maintenance at the Auger platform kept the Llano Field shut in at the month of October. As a result, we expect fourth quarter 2013 production to be approximately 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and therefore, our full year 2013 E&P production is expected to be at the lower end of the guidance range of 340,000 to 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In addition, due to the absence of low unit cost barrels from Libya, fourth quarter 2013 cash cost and DD&A expense are each expected to be in the range of $24 to $25 per barrel. And our full year guidance for total unit cost is being increased to $44 to $45 per barrel from our earlier guidance of $40 to $42 per barrel of oil equivalent.","The increase in unit cost per barrel is expected to be largely offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate due to the loss of Libya's high tax production. The E&P fourth quarter 2013 effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 39% to 41%, and our full year guidance is being reduced to 42% to 44% from the earlier guidance of 46% to 50%. Absent the impact of changes in commodity prices, our cash margin on a per barrel basis is expected to increase in the fourth quarter with the return of high margin production in the Gulf of Mexico and the absence of our Libyan production, which has cash margins well below the E&P portfolio average.","Turning to our supplemental information. We have posted a supplemental earnings presentation on our website, which has been updated this quarter to include new operational data for our Utica Shale operations in Ohio. We have added 2013 rig and well counts, details on average net revenue interest percentages, acreage positions and well test results. All data has been split between our joint venture and 100% owned interest. In addition, pro forma E&P results now include both current and deferred taxes.","Turning to Corporate. Corporate expenses after income taxes were $35 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $50 million in the second quarter. Second quarter Corporate expenses include proxy solicitation cost for the annual shareholders meeting and higher professional fees. After-tax interest expense was $54 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $63 million in the second quarter, due to higher capitalized interest and lower average outstanding borrowings.","Turning to discontinued operations. Earnings from the Downstream businesses were $54 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared with $11 million in the second quarter. Third quarter results included net after-tax income of $23 million from items affecting comparability of earnings between periods compared with after-tax charges of $21 million in the second quarter.","Turning to our capital return to shareholders. During the third quarter of 2013, the corporation increased its quarterly dividend 150% to $0.25 per share and purchased approximately 6,530,000 common shares at an average price of $76.60 for a total cost of approximately $500 million.","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter, including a decrease of $143 million from changes in working capital, was $1,254,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,431,000,000. Common stock acquired and retired was $500 million. Net borrowings were $372 million. Common stock dividends paid were $85 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $14 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $404 million.","We had $321 million of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2013, and $642 million at December 31, 2012. Total debt was $6,209,000,000 at September 30, 2013, compared with $8,111,000,000 at December 31, 2012. And the corporation's debt to capitalization ratio was 20.7% at September 30, 2013, compared with 27.7% at the end of 2012.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call back to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. A quick question, just on the retail. I guess if you're going to spin that out, you're going to do, I guess, get a private letter ruling from the IRS. Can you give us any updates on where you are in terms of the mechanics of the retail?","John P. Rielly","Well, first, we're doing a parallel process. We're going to go down the process of looking at a potential public market option, like you had mentioned, as well as go through an M&A process. So we're going to go through both of that, and we're going to maximize value to shareholders. As far as the private letter ruling and what we're doing for filing with the SEC, we're kind of on track. Everything is moving along according to schedule, and we anticipate getting that and get some further information out later this quarter and into early 2014.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, very clear and very helpful. Just coming to the Bakken. Maybe, Greg, thanks for giving us the initial thoughts on down spacing. Maybe any color on whether you can go beyond that. Obviously, some of the other companies are hoping to downspace much further. That would be helpful.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So just in terms of down spacing, our base design has been 9 wells per 1,280-acre DSU. So that's 5 wells in the Middle Bakken, and 4 on the Three Forks. So that yields effectively a 250- and 320-acre well spacing, respectively. Now based on the results of our infill pilot programs, we think that we can further downspace with minimal interference. So over the next 12 months, we're going to install tighter spacing at 17 of our DSUs, with 7 wells in the Middle Bakken and 6 in the Three Forks. So this will bring the spacing down to 180 acres in the Middle Bakken and 210 acres in the Three Forks. So again, moving from 250 to 180 in the Middle Bakken and 320 to 210 in the Three Forks.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And maybe just a quick follow on. That I guess is the 2014 program, but would you then go for deeper spacing once you've established the results of that across the acreage.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. I mean, if -- assuming it all works as expected, then we would go full-scale with the tighter infill program on a go-forward basis.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sorry. So would you able to downspace to a tighter level than the 7 and 6? Or...","Gregory P. Hill","Potentially. We're going to test a couple of DSUs in an even tighter configuration next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So it appears that upside is clearly unfolding in the Bakken in Europe and specifically Valhall looks like production and gas margins are headed higher there too. But at the same time, it also seems like there could be upside potential at Valhall when you consider the recovery rates in some of the neighboring fields. And so my question's whether you consider the opportunity for improved recovery on Valhall, intermediate to longer term, to be real and why or why not is this is obviously a pretty significant part of the portfolio these days.","John B. Hess","Yes, Doug. Just to be clear, we have not been happy with BP's performance as operator of Valhall. And recently as you know, we had, Greg and I, a senior meeting with BP's leadership to express our concerns. We have worked with them to jointly develop a performance improvement plan, and the results are beginning to show. The facilities have begun to run more reliably, and production is currently averaging the year net 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The prize, as you rightly point out, at Valhall remains significant, with a net remaining recoverable resource to our company of more than 500 million barrels. Our primary focus is to work with BP to grow production over the coming years and leverage our chalk reservoir drilling and completion capability we've developed in South Arne in Denmark. While we're encouraged by the recent progress, if performance does not continue to improve, we'll consider our strategic options.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Greg, I wonder if I could take you back to the Bakken for a second. So you talked about the well pattern changing I guess the 7 and 6. You haven't talked about deeper benches. Continental obviously talks about second, third and fourth benches. That's the reason for-- I'm just pointing out the additional down spacing, and neither have you addressed your longer-term production guidance or resource estimates based on the old pattern. So if that's changing can you give us some color as to how you think about the longer-term targets. And I've got a follow-up please.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, sure, you bet. So let's take it in order. So let's talk about the Three Forks first, Doug. So as you know, we've continued to delineate the Three Forks in 2012 and 2013. And so by the end of this year, we should have about 140 Three Forks wells drilled and on production. So that's proved up some 40% of our 550,000 to 600,000 core acres. And we expect ultimately that some 60% to 65% of our core acreage is going to be economic for the Three Forks. Results on the Three Forks have been great. So results to date have exceeded our expectations. And in fact, our well results, coupled with the publicly available production data, show that our Three Forks acreage is among the best in the play. So a little context on where we are in the Three Forks. Regarding the benches, we do see several discrete thicker packages in certain areas of the field, where we will plan to test whether or not more than one well in the Three Forks actually can deliver superior returns. And so we'll test that next year as part of our 2014 plan. Now in reference to the longer-term potential of the Bakken, if you think about where we are today so in a 5 and 4 configuration, that yields about 2,500 future drilling locations and about 1 billion barrels of recoverable resource. Also because of the performance of the Three Forks, that long-term 120,000 barrels a day guidance is going to go up, and we plan to give some more color on that when we issue our annual guidance at the first of the year. Now regarding 7 and 6, obviously, those numbers will go up again. So the well counts will go up. The resource will go up. The long-term production will go up further above the Three Forks correction. As we get data from our pilots and drill our wells and get them on production, see the pressure response, then we'll give a second upgrade to the guidance in 2015.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk about the pace, Greg, in terms of rig count. In light of all of the above, I'm assuming the current pace will accelerate.","Gregory P. Hill","Sure. Now we haven't finalized our budget yet. So I'll put that caveat on it. But this year, we're at 14 rigs. We plan on increasing that to 17 rigs next year. And then if the 7 and 6 works, assuming it does, and we're confident it will, then you'll see a step to rig count up to 20 rigs a year after and potentially higher after that.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. My follow-up is a little bit quicker. I guess it's to either of the Johns. The pace of buybacks, it seems like a sizable buyback, but didn't really impact the share count too much. So I'm just wondering if you could help us with what was going on in the timing during the quarter and how you see the pace of buybacks on a go-forward basis, largely, over the next 12 months. I'll leave it there.","John P. Rielly","Sure. In the quarter, and I think you said it. It really was the timing. We started -- we didn't start from the beginning of the quarter buying back shares. So we were buying back more in August and September. There's also when you look at the dilutive effect, obviously, our share price has been increasing. So from a dilution standpoint, that adds more shares into the calculation as well. So that's why you're not seeing it begin to flow through again in the fourth quarter, as we continue. So going forward, from a pace standpoint, we are going to continue to be disciplined on the pace. What we've done with our share buyback, as we said before, is we started out because from the Energy Marketing sale of $1 billion, we're tying our buybacks to the proceeds. So with that $1 billion, we started on that plan, we've now announced the Terminal sale from that. So we'll continue on at this disciplined pace, buying back stock.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wondered if you could provide us with an update on pricing and realizations there. And if there's some sort of rule of thumb for now and going forward as to how the oil will price there.","John P. Rielly","Unfortunately, Paul, there really isn't a rule of thumb. So in prior quarters or even going back into late last year, you had the big spread on the Brent TI. So obviously, moving -- excuse me, moving by train, getting to the coast, you got a bigger uplift from the price realizations. Those have come in. We're still making money on the rail. In the quarter, probably added around $3 per barrel to our realizations from the rail, but obviously, they've squeezed. Now Clearbrook and local pricing in Western North Dakota versus WTI, it's going to move based on what's happening in the market. So we're still planning to use all 3 market options, going south to St. James, going East and West with our crude. And it's going to just factor in to where the price realizations are at the time.","John B. Hess","Yes, just a little more color there. During the quarter, the WTI Brent spread narrowed. I think TI actually, for a couple of days, was over Brent. As you know, right now, TI is probably about $10 under, and there's a further discount at the wellhead for our North Dakota production. So the rail facility continues to add value to our net backs. How you can get a rule of thumb given the variability just in the third quarter is next to impossible. The good news is our company is competitively positioned versus, I think, anybody else to maximize the value of our production there, and we continue to do that. Up to 54,000 barrels a day we're moving by rail right now. About 1\/3 is going to the East and West Coast, and the balance goes to the Gulf Coast. And as the East and West Coast increase their ability to receive crude and assuming those markets are more favorable than the Gulf, we'll be able to exploit those opportunities even more in the future.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's extremely helpful. Firstly, could you indicate the -- just remind us, the cost or the net back that you get when you move to those markets. So I guess you'd be pricing off the crudes in those given coastal markets, how much less do you get for the transport cost in each case? And secondly, where will we expect to be in terms of your ability to move crude out away from Clearbrook, let's say, next year or at a given point in the future? Why not say the end of 2014?","John B. Hess","The East and West Coast trade more on a Brent basis, and the transportation cost is not materially different. It's a little higher to the East Coast, a little less to the West Coast, but that's figured out in the differentials that you get, but it's more Brent based, where the price you get in the Gulf Coast could be tied to Brent, could be tied to LLS. And as always, Paul, we'll be situated to maximize value according to what market signals that we get.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the future development of your ability to move, John?","John P. Rielly","I'm sorry.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm just wondering how much you're going to be able to move to the coast, let's say, in a year's time.","John P. Rielly","That's going to be more a function of the different refineries on the East and West Coast ability to take unit trains. Right now, there are a few. And as they improve their capability, we'll be able to do more. Right now, it's sort of limited to that 1\/3 that I mentioned of the 54 a day. If the markets improve, hopefully that number will increase. And quite frankly, if the train differentials still give us better value, we can look at getting a few more trains if we need that, in addition to the 9 unit trains that we already have.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And my follow-up is, can you update us just on the latest timing for the sale of the Asian assets if we're expecting some news before the end of the year.","John B. Hess","Yes, we're well advanced, and more than that we're really not in a position to say. I know there's some big news out there. I don't want to front run the sale process, but it's well advanced.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Mei with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Brandon Mei - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I appreciate the color on the production guidance post 2013. I was just wondering if you can give some corresponding guidance to the CapEx? And also with the ramp and Bakken down spacing and CapEx there, how does that affect your total plan?","John P. Rielly","Going forward, in 2014, I mean, obviously we'll give our full guidance after we've gone through our budget process here in the fourth quarter, but the guidance we've been given is that the capital spend will have a 5 in front of it. So a 5 handle. That's basically the only guidance that we've given out right now for 2014. And again, now early days on the Bakken, but what we've basically -- you heard from Greg earlier that we do plan, at least right now, to add some rigs to the Bakken. However, from an overall capital spend in the Bakken standpoint, that's not necessarily increasing our spend there because we are spending a lot on infrastructure this year in 2013. And as you know, getting the Tioga Gas Plant, we're actually going to have to shut down and commissioning here towards the end of this year. So the infrastructure spend will be moving more to drilling, keeping the Bakken capital number around the same. So that's general guidance here for '14.","Brandon Mei - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Can you remind us what the CapEx was on infrastructure in the Bakken for 2013?","John P. Rielly","Yes. It would be between $500 million and $600 million.","Brandon Mei - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one more for me. Can you quantify the RIN contribution this quarter?","John P. Rielly","Yes. It was $28 million after-tax that we did recognize the benefit from in the third quarter from RINs. Now where current pricing is, we're expecting an immaterial contribution in the fourth quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I think -- a number of quick question then. John Rielly, will you be willing to share with us what is the Energy Marketing and Terminal EBITDA or pretax income or after-tax income, whatever is the metric in the third quarter?","John P. Rielly","No, Paul. We haven't been giving that information out. So, I mean, you saw with the announcement from Direct on where they had the EBITDA number for the Energy Marketing business. And then as far as Terminals, no, we are, again, it's commercially sensitive here as we go through the transaction with Buckeye.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. And, Greg, Bakken continue to improve. As of this point, from a productivity improvement standpoint, do you think that you already captured the bulk of that order? Do you think that you're just scratching that surface and then there's far more to go?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, in terms of -- first on the cost, as you mentioned, the Bakken continues to improve. So our well cost went from 8.4 to 7.8 in a quarter, and that's a result of our application lean manufacturing to just continue to drive improvement. I think on the productivity side, I mean, we are constantly testing various things to try and improve the productivity and also bring the cost down as well. So there's that kind of -- there's a sweet spot, I call it, where cost and productivity meet to drive the highest return. So we're focused on drilling the highest return Bakken wells, not necessarily the highest production or not necessarily the lowest cost. We're really trying to find that maximum return point in the Bakken.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And, Greg, or then maybe it's for John, you guys very kind to give a lot more information in Bakken, including the well cost. How about on the cash operating cost? Is that something that you guys may consider start giving out that information?","Gregory P. Hill","That's a currently -- and I know, Paul, we've discussed this before. At this point, just to give you the same guidance is that on the cash cost, which includes production and severance taxes in there, the Bakken is slightly below our portfolio average there from all-in cash costs there. Going forward, we're looking at -- we're continuing to add information there. Obviously, you know we've got the whole, we're looking at the midstream and the marketing up there in North Dakota. So it's something we'll still be considering as we move forward to provide that information.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And, Greg, on the gas plant tie in that how many days the Bakken production operation will be impacted?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, Paul, it's mainly gas. So we'll send a lot more gas to flare, right? The liquids will be a very small number, a couple of thousand barrels a day for the quarter, 1,000 to 2,000 barrels a day. So the impact to oil is very small.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So that means that your fourth quarter Bakken production should not be really materially impacted by this shutdown?","Gregory P. Hill","That's right.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So we just continue to see them going higher, may not be going as much of the sequential increase as from second to third, but should not be flat.","Gregory P. Hill","Just to add to that Paul, I mean, with the gas and the shutdown, we are -- in that number that I gave out earlier the 320,000 barrels a day, we are seeing Bakken essentially flat with that number -- in that number that I gave, just because due to the shutdown and the shut in of gas.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Any reason that they should be? Because shut-in the gas that you may be losing, say, in the third quarter, is 44 million cubic feet per day, but you're not going to shut down for the entire quarter is it?","Gregory P. Hill","No, we aren't. It will go down probably the third week of November. We're still just finalizing all that. The gas plant will go down, and then we'll start commissioning the plant at the end of the year.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. So it will be 1.5 months old. Your job say 25 -- a 25 million cubic feet per day, or that 4,000...","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, 6 weeks. Yes.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that you typically grow by, say, maybe somewhere in the 5 to 6. So...","Gregory P. Hill","Well, I think importantly, Paul, what we said in the opening remarks, all that's built in to our guidance, it's 64 to 70 on the Bakken. That's all built in. So that range is still very valid.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And, Greg, on Utica, in order for you to come to the commercial development decision, what is the steps or what kind of condition that you need to, to be met, before you can get to that decision?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, I think, certainly, with the wet gas, we will be making that decision at the end of 2014 once we finish delineation, and remember that is all HBP in FEED or fee acreage. And it effectively has no royalty. So the economics of that are very strong, and so we've already moved to pad drilling in a number of well locations. So we're effectively delineating and developing at the same time. But as far as a full field sanctioned decision, that will come at the end of 2014 as part of our budgeting process. So that's the plan, but the wells are looking great, and the economics look really well with that kind of a royalty.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, can you remind me that how -- what is your net acreage position for the wet gas area?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, yes, okay, it's 73,000 currently net acres on the JV acreage. Now, not all of that's wet gas. So about 30,000 or so, 30,000 to 35,000 will be wet gas acreage. The rest is oil acreage that we don't have any plans to develop on the far West.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I see. And then a -- a final one. Australia, any update on the long-term gas supply agreement?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So we continue to make progress. We're pleased with the progress that we are making on Australia, and we're closer than we ever have been. That's about all I can say at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","I know you can't say much about the Asian sale, but what about tax efficiency of the sale? Do we expect a big tax bite?","John P. Rielly","Again the guidance I've been giving is that from overall proceeds that the cash tax effect will be less than 5%, and that is driven by the Asian sales over there. So there is some leakage with the Asian sales, but again from our overall proceed numbers that we're talking about it's less than 5%.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. One for Greg, in terms of the Utica. Is your line demarcating the wet gas, dry gas kind of moving a little bit more to the east in terms of the wet gas? Because you had some wells here on your map that had reasonable liquids content that you had in the dry area.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think between our wells and industry wells, those lines are constantly moving. They're not moving tens of miles or hundred of miles. So you're kind of on the edge here of trying to find that window. In the Western part of the dry gas window, which is kind of that transition area from the dry gas to wet gas, those liquids are predominantly NGLs. And then as we move further West, towards Harrison County and West Belmont County and the East Guernsey County, those total liquids percentages gradually increase to around 60% and then the condensate portion of these liquids goes as high as 35% when you get over there. So you can begin to see where the real sweet spots are, and we're right in the heart of it.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Great. Last one for me is on Ghana. Would you go solo if need be?","Gregory P. Hill","I'm sorry. Could you ask that question again?","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Ghana, say you don't find a partner in terms of the PO, would you go solo in terms of the development there?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, I think we're committed to the appraisal program certainly. However, I will say that the data room's been very active. So we anticipate getting bids sometime in November. So.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First on Kurdistan, on the first prospect, do you guys have a pre-drill estimate for that?","Gregory P. Hill","We do, but we typically don't give those out for pre-drill.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Any order of magnitude?","Gregory P. Hill","No, obviously, if we have a discovery, we'll give you some color on that in the first quarter.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. On the Utica, you mentioned still about a year away from kind of FFID decision-making. Your guidance, over the next 5 years, just to clarify, does not ascribe any credit for the Utica, correct?","John P. Rielly","No. It does. For the wet gas portion, which, as Greg said, we started some pad drilling. We are drilling and hooking up wells there. We do have a contribution from the wet gas portion of the Utica in that guidance.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, but nothing else for the play?","John P. Rielly","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phillips Johnston with Capital One.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on Doug's question regarding the lower Three Forks benches. I thought some of the 55 wells that were planned for this year were actually targeting the second bench. So I just wanted to clarify comments, which sounded like so far you haven't really tested any of the lower benches and just as a follow-up I was wondering what the mix might be for next year's Three Forks wells in terms of what percentage might be drilled into the first, second, third or fourth benches.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So just to clarify, I think what we said was yes, we wanted to target those lower benches, but what we did this year was go down and get core from a lot of those locations. And as I said in my remarks, it does appear that there are certain parts of the field where you do have 2 big thick sections of the Three Forks. So we plan to actually put horizontals in some of the second bench areas next year. Now, I will say once again, I think, ultimately the decision on multiple benches in the Three Forks is going to come down to returns. Because obviously, if I put 2 wells in 2 benches in the Three Forks, I'd better, at least, get double the recovery or economically from a return standpoint, it doesn't make sense.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right. So probably no wells next year in terms of a third or the fourth bench. That's probably a 2015 type of...","Gregory P. Hill","No, I don't -- the majority of our acreage, if there is multiple bench, it appears to be in the second bench. The third and fourth bench, much more isolated and much smaller.","Operator","With no more questions, that concludes our call today, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

My name is Crystal, and I will be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President, Worldwide Exploration and Production; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay, and welcome to you, all, on our first quarter conference call. I will make some high-level comments on the quarter and the progress we are making in executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then discuss our E&P operations, and John Rielly will go over our financial results.","Our results this quarter demonstrate continued execution of our plan to drive cash-generative growth and sustainable returns for our shareholders through a focused portfolio of world-class E&P assets. In the first quarter, our growth assets performed well with higher production from Valhall and North Malay Basin.","In addition, current Bakken production levels are in excess of 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, following completion of the Tioga gas plant expansion. Tubular Bells is on track for first oil in the third quarter, and well results from the Utica Shale play are encouraging. Overall, we remain very enthusiastic about the prospects for our company in 2014 and beyond.","With regard to our financial results, net income for the first quarter of 2014 was $386 million or $446 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.38 compared to $1.95 in the year-ago quarter.","Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $1.4 billion. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, our results were impacted by asset sales, which reduced production by 77,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the shut-in of production in Libya, which reduced production by 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Net production in the first quarter averaged 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 297,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a pro forma basis, excluding divestitures. This represents an increase of 11% from pro forma production of 268,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in last year's first quarter, excluding Libya. This improvement was driven by higher production from the Valhall Field in Norway and North Malay Basin in Malaysia.","Regarding the Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% working interest, net production averaged 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. This compares to 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter when production was restarting, following the completion of the multi-year field redevelopment project. Two wells were brought online in the first quarter, and facility uptime and reliability have continued to improve.","In Malaysia, net production from the North Malay Basin, where Hess is the operator with a 50% interest, averaged 40 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter. The early production system commenced in October of last year and will maintain production at current levels through 2016. Full field development is ongoing and should result in net production increasing to 165 million cubic feet per day in 2017.","Net production from the Bakken averaged 63,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. The Tioga gas plant commenced start-up operations on March 23 and began residual gas sales on March 25. Production from both the field and the plants increased through April. And as I mentioned earlier, current net production from the Bakken is in excess of 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our full year 2014 production forecast remains 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Our Bakken team continues to drive our well costs lower. In the first quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $7.5 million, a 13% savings from the year-ago quarter. In addition, our wells continue to be more productive than the industry average.","In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, development of the Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess has a 57% interest and is operator, remains on schedule to achieve first oil in the third quarter. During the first quarter, the SPAR and Topsides were towed out and installed on location. Three producing wells have been predrilled with pay counts coming in above expectations. As a result, we plan to drill a fourth producer in the second half of this year.","In terms of divestitures, on April 23, we announced that we completed the sale of our Exploration and Production assets in Thailand for $1 billion based upon an effective date of July 1, 2013. The divestiture processes for our retail marketing and trading businesses are well advanced. Also, we continue to make progress in our plans to monetize our Bakken midstream assets in 2015, most likely through an MLP structure, through which Hess will retain operational control while maximizing the value of our infrastructure investment.","Regarding our share repurchase program, through April 29, we have repurchased 14.3 million shares for $1.1 billion in 2014. Since commencement of the program in August of 2013, we have repurchased 33.6 million shares for $2.7 billion.","In sum, we are pleased with the progress we continue to make in our transformation to become a pure-play E&P company. We are confident that our initiatives have positioned the company to achieve 5% to 8% compound average annual production growth through 2017, off of our 2012 pro forma base and to generate free cash flow post 2014 based upon $100 Brent. In addition, the strength of our balance sheet provides the financial flexibility to fund this cash-generative growth that will deliver strong sustainable returns for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Greg.","Gregory P. Hill","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an operational update and a review of the progress we are making in executing our E&P strategy.","Starting with unconventionals. In the first quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 63,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While the severe winter weather in the first quarter delayed the start-up of the Tioga plant by approximately 3 weeks and deferred bringing new wells online, the Bakken team has done an outstanding job of getting us back on schedule.","First gas was introduced to the Tioga plant on March 23. First residue gas sales commenced on March 25 and ethane recovery on April 23. Also, we brought 24 new wells online in April compared to 30 wells in the first quarter, and current net Bakken production is in excess of 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In the second quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 75,000 and 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our full year 2014 Bakken production guidance remains at 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Drilling and completion costs continue to be reduced with the first quarter averaging $7.5 million per well versus $8.6 million per well in the year-ago quarter and $7.6 million per well in the fourth quarter of 2013. And the productivity of our wells continues to be above industry average.","We are continuing with our down spacing pilots of 17 well pads, having 13 wells per drilling spacing unit with 7 wells in the Middle Bakken and 6 in the Three Forks to allow us to determine optimal spacing and cross play. Early field results are encouraging.","We are also conducting pilots on 2 pads with an even tighter 17 well per DSU configuration with 9 wells in the Middle Bakken and 8 in the Three Forks. By the end of this year, we expect to have sufficient data to provide updated guidance for well spacing, production, drilling locations and resource potential.","Turning to the Utica. The appraisal and early development of our 43,000 core net acres in the Hess CONSOL joint venture continues, and we are encouraged by well results to date with rates averaging 1,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 59% liquids based on 24-hour tests.","In 2014, Hess and CONSOL plan to drill some 30 to 35 wells across our joint venture acreage. In the first quarter we drilled 8 wells, completed 3 and tested one well in the joint venture acreage.","In the offshore, progress continues at Valhall, North Malay Basin and Tubular Bells. At the BP-operated field in Norway, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. Two producers were brought online following workovers, and facilities reliability has been considerably improved. Full year 2014 net production from Valhall is forecast by the operator to be in the range of 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil per day.","At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, first quarter net production continued at 40 million cubic feet per day through the early production system and is expected to remain at this level through 2016. Contracts for the central processing platform for the full field development will be awarded in the second quarter, and we continue to advance our full field development project, which is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day in 2017.","At our 57% owned and operated Tubular Bells development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the SPAR and Topsides were installed on schedule during the quarter. And we are on track for field start-up in the third quarter of 2014 with net production building to 25,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Due to the positive results from the wells drilled to date, we intend to spud a fourth producer mid-year, which is expected to be run [ph] on production in the first quarter of 2015.","At the Malaysia\/Thailand Joint Development Area, there's a 30-day planned shutdown commencing in early June for work associated with booster compression tie-ins. As a result, net production from this asset is expected to be curtailed by approximately 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the second quarter.","Company-wide production on a pro forma basis, and excluding Libya, is forecast to average between 295,000 and 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2014. And our full year 2014 forecast on the same basis remains 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In terms of exploration, in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block in Ghana, in late March, we successfully farmed out a 40% license interest. Hess will retain a 50% license interest in operatorship. Our new partner will pay a disproportionate share of the cost during the appraisal phase to earn their interest in the block. Appraisal drilling is expected to commence in May, beginning with a down-dip pass on discovery.","In Kurdistan, where Hess has a 64% license interest and is operator of the Shakrok and Dinarta blocks, we completed drilling at the Shakrok-1 well. We plan to perform production tests over multiple intervals in Jurassic age reservoir, which was the primary target of the well. In May, we plan to spud the well the Shireen well on the Dinarta block.","In closing, in this quarter, we have continued executing against our plan and delivering key milestones, including those on Tioga, Tubular Bells and North Malay Basin. We see increasing upside in our high-quality acreage position in the Bakken, where we continue to drive top quartile operational performance and leverage our infrastructure advantage. And finally, we are entering a key phase of exploration in Kurdistan and appraisals in Ghana.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2013.","The corporation generated consolidated net income of $386 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $1,925,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted earnings were $446 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $319 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to Exploration and Production. E&P had income of $508 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $1,029,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013. E&P adjusted earnings were $514 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $436 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.","The changes in after-tax components of adjusted earnings were as follows: higher realized selling prices increased earnings by $46 million, lower operating costs increased income by $56 million, lower exploration expenses improved earnings by $15 million, lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $12 million. All other items net to a decrease in earnings of $27 million, for an overall increase in first quarter adjusted earnings of $78 million.","Our E&P crude oil operations were under-lifted compared with production by approximately 1.1 million barrels in the quarter, which decreased after-tax income by approximately $35 million. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was 39% for the first quarter of 2014 and 38% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Turning to Corporate and interest. Corporate and interest expenses, net of income taxes, were $89 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $115 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted Corporate and interest expenses were $81 million in the first quarter, down from $108 million in the fourth quarter. The decreased costs in the first quarter were a result of lower interest expenses and reduced employee-related costs.","Turning to downstream. The downstream businesses reported losses of $33 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with income of $1,011,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted earnings were $13 million in the first quarter compared to an adjusted loss of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting improved trading results.","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter, including a decrease of $248 million from changes in working capital, was $1,158,000,000. Net proceeds from asset sales were $1,237,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,444,000,000. Common stock acquired and retired amounted to $1,043,000,000. Repayments of debt were $333 million. Common stock dividends paid were $79 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $22 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $526 million.","Turning to our stock repurchase program. During the first quarter, we purchased approximately 12.6 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $1 billion or $79.33 per share, bringing cumulative purchases through March 31 to 31.9 million shares at a cost of $2.54 billion or $79.53 per share.","We have continued to buyback our common stock. And through April 29, total program-to-date purchases were 33.6 million shares at a cost of $2.68 billion or $79.84 per share. We had $1,288,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2014, compared with $1,814,000,000 at the end of last year. Total debt was $5,576,000,000 at March 31, 2014, down from $5,798,000,000 at December 31, 2013. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at March 31, 2014, was 18.7%, which was improved from 19% at the end of 2013.","Turning to second quarter 2014 guidance. I would like to provide estimates for certain metrics. For the second quarter, E&P cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent are estimated to be in the range of $22 to $22.50 per barrel. The expected increase in cash cost per barrel over the $21.11 in the first quarter of 2014 is primarily related to lower production volumes following the asset sale in Thailand as pro forma cash costs were $22.17 in the first quarter.","E&P depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses per barrel are estimated to be in the range of $28 to $28.50 for the second quarter. The increase from the $25.19 per barrel in the first quarter of 2014 is primarily due to higher production volumes in the Bakken, lower volumes at the JDA due to a planned shutdown and the impact of selling assets in Thailand, which were not being depreciated while classified as held for sale.","Full year 2014 unit cost guidance of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel for cash costs, and $29 to $30 per barrel for depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses remains unchanged. For the full year 2014, the E&P effective tax rate is still expected to be in the range of 37% to 41%, and the second quarter rate is expected to be in the range of 37% to 39%. The estimate for Corporate expenses in 2014 remains in the range of $125 million to $135 million after taxes. And after-tax interest expenses are still estimated to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million. Second quarter Corporate expenses are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million, and interest expenses are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. Earlier in the week, there was a retail acquisition [indiscernible] 14x forward EBITDA. It was a utilization reminder of MLP structure for wholesale fuels business and ability to characterize some of that retail site value as wholesale fuel and thus MLP qualifying income. So, I mean, my question is have you examined the potential MLP value in your retail assets? And do you consider that potential value when you consider the value in a sale process? And I have a follow-up.","John B. Hess","Yes, Evan. As you well know, our divestiture process for our Retail business is well advanced. We certainly are prepared to move forward with a spin, and at the same time, we're conducting a parallel process to look at all of our other options, including outright sale. And the process is well underway.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. The transaction surely highlights the value there. Can you share a tax basis in the retail?","John P. Rielly","What we're going to do, Evan, is anything related to disclosures on that would come through future SEC filings. So should we pursue a spin option. So again I think, as John said, we're well advanced in the processing, and that's where we want to be right now from a disclosure standpoint.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Fair enough. Can you give me the tax basis on the electric JV interest sale or the tax implications there?","John P. Rielly","Sure. The gain on sale on that transaction will be limited.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And maybe at the risk of a similar response, on potential MLP-able assets, I'm not asking in EBITDA figures, but can you discuss any potential assets outside the Bakken, which is clear that may qualify, Gulf of Mexico, for instance, with Tubular Bells platform investment or anything that's outside of the Bakken would be helpful.","John P. Rielly","So our clear focus right now is focusing on our Bakken midstream assets, and that's where our efforts are going right now. And we're still on track I think on the guidance that we've been saying. So by 2015, we look to have a monetization event relating to those Bakken midstream assets. We plan to get SEC filings in place here in the second half of the year for that. Over time, yes, we have other midstream assets in our portfolio that could ultimately be dropped into that. But that will be at a later point.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. Maybe lastly, if I could. Just on Tioga. Can you just remind us of third-party volumes we should expect there before you fully fill the plant just so I kind of can understand that?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So I could give you a sense of current volumes right now, Evan. Right now, the plant end-up rates are about 120 million to 140 million cubic feet a day. And roughly 70% of that is Hess-operated production and third is -- and 30% is third party. So obviously as we ramp our production up, our volumes will go up. But our plan is to fill that plant to capacity of 250 million cubic feet a day as rapidly as we can. And then we're also looking at ways to de-bottleneck that facility to further increase the capacity to 300 million cubic feet or higher.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. Just a very quick follow on from Evan's conversation on retail, and again you may not give this. But you had I think $13 million in the downstream in the first quarter. Do you have a number for what was sort of retail-only EBITDA within that?","John P. Rielly","[indiscernible] of the divestiture process.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood. Okay. A question for Greg then on the down spacing. We've been tracking some of the other sort of down spacing tests in the industry, and some of them started a little bit earlier. So we've got a bit more data. We find that the EURs are in the sort of 400 MBOE range, i.e., slightly lower than where the sort of original wells would be. But obviously, you get a saving in terms of the costs. So I'm just getting a sense of do you see this playing out as sort of just an area where you can add inventory, but the returns will fall? Or is this an area where you think you can actually sort of sustain the current levels of returns. And if that's the case, do you see yourself throwing more rigs at the play once you've got this down spacing test, your own tests finished? Any color there would be helpful.","Gregory P. Hill","Okay, great. Thanks, Ed. I think first of all, just to say it's early days for us. We've got 17 well pads planned with these 13 wells per DSU. So that's 7 and 6. 7 in the Middle Bakken and 6 in the Three Forks. Early field results, although limited, are very encouraging. We're seeing very little interference in those wells. So I think there's a good chance that if that continues, these will be very, very high return wells just like the current wells are. We're also doing 2 well pads that have 17 per DSU. So that's a 9 and 8, but those will come a little bit later in the year.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then maybe in terms of the geology, I mean, how much of your acreage do you think this in the sweet spot for doing the down spacing? Obviously, not all of the acreage has the Middle Bakken and Three Forks potential.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think that depends. That's why we're doing 17 well pads because we're going to try and spread those around the field because obviously in other areas, say, on the anticline where you have a lot of natural fracturing, you might see higher interference in that area of the field. So that's why we're putting these pads all around the field to try and really assess where could we apply this, right?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Doug Leggate from BoA.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've also got I guess a follow-up first on the Bakken. I guess I would probably slightly disagree with Ed's conclusions there on the down spacing, given what Continental's been doing. But my question to you guys is, you're drilling half your program this year on down spacing tests. So I would -- I guess, Greg, what I'm kind of thinking is you're managing to your inventory in terms of drilling activity. If it turns out that the 7 and 6s work but yet your current plan is 5 and 4s as I understand it, what does it do to your activity level in terms of future planning, future rig activity and ultimately, production targets out of the Bakken?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, I think as we've said, Doug, our current plan, which is 5 and 4 has 150,000-barrel-a-day target or peak in 2018 with 1.1 million barrels -- or billion barrels recoverable. Obviously, if we go to 7 and 6, that number's -- all those numbers are going to go up because the number of operated drilling locations will go up as well. And so I think you can do the math and figure out that things will go higher. Now what we haven't done yet is determine what rig pace, if this is successful, what rig pace will we prosecute on that acreage. We'll make that decision at the end of this year, and that'll be part of our business planning as we go forward in 2015 plus.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. My follow-up I guess is kind of related because it relates to the strength of your cash flow. And, John Hess, I guess the philosophical question here is you've got midstream spending in Tubular Bells that kind of falls off this year. It seems that on a pre-working capital basis, your run rate is about $5.6 billion streets [ph] below that, and you haven't even have the growth in the second half of the year. So it's kind of looking like the cash flow is very, very strong. You're selling more assets, your buybacks clearly look like that's conservative. So can you prioritize for us the use of cash as you look beyond perhaps the current year, given all of those moving parts?","John B. Hess","Sure. Well, the first priority will be to invest for future growth with our balanced approach among unconventionals exploitation and exploration to underpin the 5% to 8% average growth rate going through to 2017 and obviously, want to position beyond that. Obviously, as we move out and our lower risk cash-generative growth increases, there will be more money to consider then besides which we put in investing for growth to increase cash returns to shareholders. So when we get there, obviously, that'll be a priority as well.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So when would you anticipate making a decision on the buyback authorization because that looks like you're going to chew through the $4 billion in fairly short order.","John B. Hess","Doug, that decision will be made when the ultimate decision is made for do we spin or sell our Retail business. And then the $4 billion share buyback authorization, that's when we would be focused on do we increase it or not.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Guy Baber from Simmons & Company.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Guy Baber with Simmons. I had a question on the offshore portfolio, but you guys obviously had a very strong offshore production this quarter at both Valhall and then despite some downtime early in the quarter, it looks like Gulf of Mexico did pretty well also. So I was just hoping you could provide some incremental detail around the strong Gulf of Mexico output, specifically what drove that? How sustainable might that be as we think about the rest of the year? And has production, in fact, been better than what you expected internally? And then at Valhall, can you just talk a little bit about confidence and the sustainability of some of the improvement, the uptime and reliability of that asset, just given its importance to your overall outlook?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Let me talk about Valhall first, and then I'll go to the Gulf of Mexico. So in Valhall, we've established regular executive level engagements with BP management all the way up to Bob Dudley. And we're actively progressing an agreed plan between our 2 companies. And we're encouraged by the progress that BP is making. In Q1, we saw 2 producers brought online following workovers, and facilities reliability has been considerably improved. So they've worked through a number of the issues. After the redevelopment start up, it was dragging the right reliability down. So we're cautiously optimistic that, that can be sustained, the higher reliability, because it's brand-new kit, it's brand-new equipment out on the platform. Regarding the Gulf of Mexico, the big increase, of course, quarter-on-quarter was at Llano followed by Conger. Now that was, if you recall, Shell had a pipeline go down for 22 days in December. That all came back in January. The Llano contributions actually from the Llano 4 well, that was brought on very late in November. So that's a sustainable volume going forward. And as we mentioned, Valhall was at 37. So that's good performance from Valhall as well.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I had a follow-up just on -- I just wanted to run through the 2Q production guidance again. I think you mentioned it would be flat effectively quarter-on-quarter. But you do have a pretty significant ramp-up in the Bakken at 15,000 barrels a day. I apologize if I missed this, but did you mention any major turnaround activity for 2Q that would be offsetting? Or is there just an element of conservatism embedded in the guidance?","John P. Rielly","Yes. So let me just kind of walk you through the math. Thanks for the question. So if you look at 297, which was the first quarter 2014 pro forma production, you can add about 18, which is Bakken and some minor growth in South Arne. And then you have to back off about 11,000 to 12,000 barrels a day due to the planned downtime in JDA. So we're taking that JDA facility down in June to do some tie-ins for the booster compression. So that's where you get the offset of the growth in the Bakken and the small amount in South Arne. And then there's some other very small differences. That gets you to around 300, which is the upper end of the guidance on the 2Q 2014 pro forma.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I guess could we talk a little bit more about the Utica just in terms of -- it's a reasonable increase, the number of wells. There've been a number of other players in this space taking write-downs and backing away. Could you just sort of walk us through what -- obviously, we have the details here in the presentation, but kind of walk us through what you're seeing terms of liquids production there. Are you seeing anything in the way of oil strictly condensate? And then the process of moving that out of there at this point.","John B. Hess","Yes. So let me just put some context on it first. So we're continuing to delineate the play and improve our understanding of our core JD [ph] acreage position. So we're very encouraged by our findings to date, which show that the majority of our -- that 43,000 core net acres that we have in the JD [ph] is located in the play's wet gas sweet spot. Now, recall we have a very high net revenue interest here, about 95%, which really turbocharges the economics. And that acreage is largely held pipe [ph] production are owned in fee. And so then if you look at where we're at in the appraisal process though, we've drilled to date, so this is an inception-to-date, we've drilled about 42 wells. However, we've only tested about 15 so far. So we're still pretty early. But the well results are very encouraging. And if you average all those well results in that kind of wet gas area, it's about 1,800 barrel equivalents per day, and it'll be liquids rates that we quoted in our remarks in the opening. So very high liquids rates, very good rates. So we remain encouraged.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of where the I guess the liquid, the condensate side of that is moving. I mean, I know it's not huge numbers just yet, but no, is it staying local or are you having to shift it somewhere else?","John B. Hess","Yes. No, I mean, it's being moved to various markets, right?","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question on the exploration side or I guess now it's moved to appraisal in Ghana, got the appraisal wells. As I understood it from previous discussions, there may be some additional agreements to go with the Ghana government. Any update of where we are there or how should we think about the timeline of Ghana, assuming a reasonable success rate out of the appraisal program?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. I think as we said in our opening remarks, the rig is going to show up mid-May, and then we'll prosecute the appraisal program. So by year end, we should have a good understanding of what we have in the appraisal program in Ghana.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then beyond that, I mean, is it a negotiation with the Ghana government -- how should we think about the process working from that point?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, after that, you have to file a development plan with the government assuming that you go forward. And yes, there will be some negotiation in that development plan, but that would be the next step. So that would be a 2015 item that we'd get our development program through the government.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe, to Greg, the first one on Ghana. You're talking about farmdown your partner going to pay a disproportion on the appraisal program. Can you give us some idea that what is up to?","Gregory P. Hill","We can't yet. That's confidential, commercially confidential with the partner.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I see. So you can't disclose who is the partner also I presume.","Gregory P. Hill","No, we can't, not yet.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Not yet. In the -- I think that when you're talking about Valhall for the full year, talking about 30, 35. Since the first quarter, you did 37. If that means that we have some major downtime in the second or third quarter? It doesn't look like it's second. So should we assume that third quarter, they're going to have some meaningful maintenance downtime?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. There will be some seasonal downtime in the North Sea every year in that third quarter. And then you'll have some normal decline at Valhall as well.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I see. And maybe this is for John Rielly. John, when I'm looking at the first quarter exploration expense, I know that this is close to impossible item to be really precisely predict. But should we view that as somewhat of a normalized run rate going forward because that is much lower than what we typically experience or that normally expected from the company over the last several years.","John P. Rielly","So in the first quarter, right, there was very limited dry hole expense in there. The only thing that was in there was the noncommercial portion of the Kurdistan well, the Triassic section. So there was only a $10 million dry hole in there. So from outside of that, you could call it typical type of run rate there, but we are drilling. There's going to be exploration drilling. It's continuing in Kurdistan. It's continuing in Ghana. So just like you said, Paul, it's very difficult to predict exactly what the expense is going to be. Clearly, our expenditures are staying around that $550 million level that we said for the full year, and it will just depend on the success of the wells.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I think previously that the assumption is that you guys will decide on whether it's a spin or a sell sometime in the second quarter. Are we still looking at the same timeline or now that timeline may have changed a little bit?","John B. Hess","No, I think what we would rather do is we're well advanced in the divestiture process, and we'll make the announcement when we're ready to make the announcement.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And for -- 2 final question for John Rielly. On the -- when you're talking about the DD&A going up in the second quarter because of higher Bakken production, we look at it and ballpark estimate, it seems to suggest that the Bakken unit DD&A may be around in the $35 pass. Is that on the ballpark correct? So that we can use it to estimate in the future what should we assume the DD&A as Bakken production go up.","John P. Rielly","We haven't been specific on that, Paul, outside of saying that the Bakken DD&A is above our portfolio average, and it is a good bit above the portfolio average. So -- and just to remind you, our cash cost though on the Bakken, outside of like a quarter like this with the gas plant being down, its run rate for the cash costs are in line with our portfolio average or a little bit below. And so again, you've got to look at where we are in the process of developing the Bakken. Obviously, volumes are going to begin here to ramp up. So that volume ramp up will continue to lower our cash cost in the Bakken, as well as we continue to produce out and get more performance history in there, and our DD&A rates will come down over time as well.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Do you have any idea when that unit DD&A in Bakken will start to trend the other way going down?","John P. Rielly","It'll start just slowly each year. So starting in '15 and '16 again as we begin do that, it'll just start to slowly trend down, and you know where our Bakken D&C costs are getting to and the EURs on the wells. So ultimately, it'll track down to that with the inclusion of infrastructure costs.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, final one. On the gas plant, have you guys -- I mean, I presume you're saying that 70% of the gas is Hess operated, but that 30% is outside. So how the NGL extraction, the economic, is that based on a fee base or that you take the commodity risk by buying the gas and then you get whatever that you can sell for dry gas and NGL? Can you help us understand a little bit on the economic how that work?","John P. Rielly","Sure. So, I mean, again first, we'll do it from the Hess standpoint and then third party. So on the Hess standpoint, obviously, the economics are just taking the liquids out and getting better pricing for the liquids versus the gas or the wet gas running through the system. So that increases our economics, and you'll see the flow-through of that on our NGL production and the prices that we get. So you'll see that in the press release. As far as third party, when they're coming in, all contracts are different. And so you run on percentage of proceeds-type contracts where you'll get a certain portion of the liquids that come out that come to Hess that we then sell and get that revenue, not production, but we get that revenue associated with that. There are other contracts where some is percentage of proceeds, some is fractionation fees. So we'll get it up. You'll see that actually in our revenue line not in our production lines, but just our revenue line for E&P.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And as we're preparing this for a MLP listing next year, is it a -- any particular strategy from the management standpoint that whether you want to move your contract one way or the other to become more fee-based or that you're still okay with more on sort of the take on the commodity progress given that the 2 revenue streams have a very quite different on the multiple.","John P. Rielly","You are absolutely right, Paul. So the economics that I just talked about and the commodity exposure is what Hess will maintain and continue to maintain post an MLP-type transaction. The MLP revenue will be solely fee-based. So the MLP will charge. Even though the contracts will work for Hess, and Hess will maintain all the commodity exposure, the MLP will not have that commodity exposure. It will just be fee-based.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","There's been a tremendous number of moving parts here. Could I just ask you, and forgive me if you've already said some of these things, but could you just repeat what your full year CapEx expectation is for 2014? And to any extent that you can look forward beyond 2014 as to what you think the run rate for the company will be, could you additionally talk about where you think the optimum level of leverage is in terms of debt, debt to capital, et cetera? Whether that's changed over time or whether there's a number that we can just think of? And then could you just talk a little bit about the mechanics of the buyback, which is to say, whether it's just a rated buyback, an opportunistic buyback, anything you could add.","John P. Rielly","Sure. So first with the E&P capital guidance, it is $5.8 billion. That is still the number. And obviously, we'll track it as we go throughout the year. I think the next thing you said -- asked was about our leverage or our debt cap type.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Well, sorry to interrupt. I just wondered whether there was any sort of indication of what CapEx should be.","John P. Rielly","Sorry, Paul, yes. So on a go-forward basis, I mean, the guidance that we have been saying is that post 2014 with our capital expenditure profile, we will be free cash flow positive. So we really don't go out and give long-term guidance on where that capital level is, but it's going to be in a range like that of the $5.8 billion, but we're not going to be specific on that right now. The leverage target is not a change for us. The way we think about it is we want to maintain a solid investment-grade credit rating, and so any leverage metrics that we look at are to continue to achieve that solid investment grade, which is BBB+ at least. And then I think the last question...","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Dividend. And I guess I didn't throw in dividends, but I will now, so dividend and buyback. The buyback was just whether there's -- it's a rated kind of ongoing or on opportunistic-type approach. And then any comments you can make on where the dividend might go from here in terms of the big increase you had last year, and what you aspire to do with that going forward?","John P. Rielly","And so what we're going to continue as you've seen with our stock buyback, we have a disciplined approach to the buyback, and that is depending on market conditions. And we plan to continue that disciplined approach. I think as John Hess said earlier, we will update post the announcement of the retail transaction, whether it's a spin or it's a sale on where our authorization is for the stock buyback. So we're going to continue that way. And then as far as dividends go, as you know, we did increase the dividend last year. And John had mentioned that as we look at our free cash flow going forward and we have excess free cash flow as production increases, we will be looking at additional current returns to shareholders at that time.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Great. And then another long-term one, and I'll leave it there. You've learned a lot obviously from a very aggressive process of restructuring. Are we now looking at a terminal point for Hess? Do you have an idea of what the optimal balance of the assets and overall company will be or can we see this as an ongoing under revision-type process?","John B. Hess","As you know, Paul, with the completion of our Thailand sale, we've pretty much completed our portfolio restructuring that we announced a year ago on March 4. Retail and Hetco are the only 2 remaining for this year, and they're well underway. Obviously, let's not forget the Bakken infrastructure. That will be a monetization event next year above and beyond anything that we're doing this year. But with the transformation to a pure-play E&P substantially completed, our focus going forward is going to be on operations, driving our lower-risk cash-generative growth and sustainable returns from our portfolio. And any further portfolio reshaping would just be part of the normal course of business operations.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Campbell [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I wanted to ask you going back to the Bakken and the stack test that you're doing, do you model the Three Forks as 4 discrete zones as do some producers in the play or do you think of it in another way? And having said that, what portion of the Three Forks are you landing in the stack zone tests that are upcoming?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So we have put wells in the second bench of the Three Forks, as well as the first bench of the Three Forks. So we do see some -- we do see some potential in the deeper benches of the Three Forks. Now as I've said before, ultimately, the decisions kind of come down to economics. So does the incremental recovery from putting a well in each bench justify the cost of doing that well? Or can a single well access the majority of the reserves anyway? So that's really going to be the question that we're doing. So we're planning our test to help us answer that question. Regarding the Three Forks in general, we estimate that 60% to 65% of our acreage, core acres will be perspective for the Three Forks.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. That's helpful. Turning to the Utica quickly. Just I looked at the first quarter '14 well announcement from your partner, and I was just wondering bearing in mind that these wells are line constrained, do you -- would you qualify the performance of the first quarter '14 wells as on average with your other wells that you've published results on accounting of line constraint?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, again, I think we're continuing to delineate the play, and it wouldn't -- I wouldn't want to say that those wells were the same as other wells. Because again in our delineation, we're finding some variation in those well rates. And so no, I wouldn't say those are typical results.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And the last one that I'll -- well, actually, I wanted to ask one of you a quick question quickly. Can you give us any idea of what your current well costs are and what those might look like a year from now?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, so the -- we're still in the appraisal mode. Therefore, the cost of our wells are still pretty high as we're gathering extensive core log and technical data and plus, we continue to experiment with lateral lengths, stage counts and frac size to really try and figure out what is the optimum development plan here. But what I will say is over the past 12 months, we've achieved about a 50% reduction in per foot drilling costs and a 30% reduction in per stage completion costs. So on a per foot and per stage basis, we're seeing the same things happen that happened in the Bakken as we gain efficiencies in our drilling and completion cost, and we expect that trend will continue.","Unknown Analyst","And those efficiencies that you're getting, are you already drilling on pads or are these still standalone wells as you're seeing these efficiencies on?","Gregory P. Hill","We are. We're drilling on some pads. We've got 3 rigs operating, and some of those are on pads.","Unknown Analyst","So is it fair to qualify the reductions that you just identified as being somewhat pad-related? Or is it -- should we think of it another way at this point?","Gregory P. Hill","No, it's both pad related and efficiency related.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. And the last question I want to ask was a little bit more high level. As you're preparing to examine the production and continue drilling in Kurdistan, what's your current take of the progression to be able to export Kurdistan product over the next 12 to 18 months?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think we're continuing to develop our commercial strategy on Kurdistan as we speak.","John B. Hess","Greg and I were in Kurdistan about a month ago, and leave it to the Kurdish government to give you updates on their export plans. But the physical capacity is there to export to Turkey, and we're pretty confident that if we have a commercial discovery that can be developed, we'll be in a position to be able to export the oil.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First, back to the Utica. You've been saying over the past year that the earliest full-scale development could begin is the first half of 2015. Any changes to that timetable?","Gregory P. Hill","No. I think that's our strategy now is to figure out what the full-scale development plan will be in 2015. And that's why we're still experimenting a lot with lateral lengths and frac stages and profit loading and all those things you do to try and figure out what the optimum is.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on exploration expense, I mean, obviously, you can't really guide to it. But in Q1, the $119 million was the lowest quarterly number in 3, 4 years minimum. That's not going to be the norm going forward, that run rate is it?","John P. Rielly","No. I had mentioned it earlier. It's because we had a very limited dry hole expense in there. The only -- it was about $10 million related to the lower Triassic section of the Kurdistan well. And so that's the only dry hole expense in there. We obviously are drilling in Kurdistan, and the next well is about to spud. And then we've got drilling in Ghana. So it's very difficult to predict, but yes, it should be higher.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Fab, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Fab. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements.","With me today are John Hess, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President, Worldwide Exploration and Production; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results.","First, I would like to express our deep concern for the people suffering from the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy. Our company is doing all that we can to help meet the public's energy needs in the wake of this storm. Hess has had a long history of doing whatever it takes to meet the demand for energy during times of crises. We are very proud of and want to thank the Hess employees, who have worked around the clock to quickly open and supply 177 of our 186 Hess stations in New York City, Long Island and New Jersey.","In advance of the hurricane, we arranged to have available 85 electrical generators in the event of lost power. Approximately 80% of the gas stations in the Northeast that were impacted by Hurricane Sandy are still closed due to lack of power. The oil terminals and refineries used to supply them are still not in operation for similar reasons.","Finally, I want to recognize and thank both New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg; and New Jersey Governor, Chris Christie, and their staffs for their outstanding leadership during this difficult period.","Now I would like to provide an update on the progress we have made since our July call. As to future funding, we continue to believe that at current oil prices, the gap between operating cash flow and capital expenditures should peak this year at about $3 billion, moderate in 2013 due to lower spending and approach a balance in 2014. We also expect that this deficit will be largely met through asset sales.","Since July, we have announced the sale of our interest in Azerbaijan for $1 billion and the Beryl fields in the United Kingdom for $525 million, which together with previously announced asset sales, bring the year-to-date total to $2.4 billion. We have significant additional divestitures, either underway or in the early planning stages. We expect these sales will be completed by the end of 2013.","As a consequence of our strategic portfolio reshaping, our reserves and production base will be lower than 2012 levels. However, our Exploration and Production assets will be more focused in lower risk and offer higher growth and financial returns.","Next, I would like to discuss our financial and operating performance. Net income for the third quarter of 2012 was $557 million. Excluding nonrecurring items, earnings were $495 million versus $379 million for the third quarter of 2011.","Our earnings were positively impacted by higher crude oil sales volumes and improved Marketing and Refining results and negatively impacted by higher operating costs in Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production reported net income of $608 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 402,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 17% increase over the year ago quarter. This increase was primarily the result of higher production from the Bakken in North Dakota and Libya.","Net production from the Bakken averaged 62,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, an increase of 94% over the year ago quarter. And we shipped approximately 37,000 barrels per day of crude oil from our Tioga rail-loading facility to higher value markets, improving our price realizations.","In addition, we are currently evaluating the feasibility of building a rail unloading facility at our Port Reading, New Jersey complex to market Bakken crude oil on the East Coast. At the Waha fields in Libya, production averaged 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. The fields were shut-in during the third quarter of 2011 due to civil unrest in the country.","At the Valhall Field in Norway, net production averaged 6,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. The field was shut in July 29 to complete major field redevelopment work. This work is now expected to be completed in mid-December, after which production will resume.","With regard to exploration, Hess concluded drilling operations on the Almond prospect in Ghana. The well resulted in a discovery encountering approximately 15 net feet of oil pay. We are currently taking a drilling break to incorporate results of the 2012 drilling program into our subsurface models, and we plan to drill 2 additional wells, the first of which should spud later in the fourth quarter.","In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we spud the Ness Deep well on Green Canyon 507 on June 12. Ness Deep is a Miocene prospect, in which Hess has a 50% working interest. BHP holds the remaining 50% and is the operator. This well is anticipated to reach total depth during the fourth quarter.","Turning to Marketing and Refining. We reported net income of $53 million for the third quarter of 2012. Refining generated earnings of $18 million compared to a loss of $38 million in last year's third quarter. Marketing earnings were $17 million compared to $41 million in the year ago quarter. Gasoline volumes on a per site basis were down approximately 2%, and total convenience store sales were down nearly 7% versus last year's third quarter, reflecting the continued weak economy. In Energy Marketing, electricity and oil volumes were lower versus last year, while natural gas volumes were higher.","In summary, we are confident that our strategic portfolio reshaping, unlocking value from asset sales and redeploying the proceeds into lower risk, higher-return investments will deliver improved financial performance and create long-term value for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thank you, John. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare third quarter 2012 results to the second quarter. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $557 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $549 million in the second quarter. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the corporation had earnings of $495 million in the third quarter compared with $585 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production reported earnings of $608 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $644 million in the second quarter. There were several items affecting comparability of Exploration and Production earnings between periods. Excluding these items, Exploration and Production had income of $546 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $680 million in the second quarter.","The third quarter results included an after-tax gain of $349 million related to the sale of the corporation's interest in the Schiehallion Field, partly offset by after-tax charges totaling $287 million. These after-tax charges consisted of $116 million for asset impairments resulting from increases to the corporation's estimated abandonment liabilities for nonproducing properties, $56 million to write off the corporation's assets in Peru as a result of a decision to cease further appraisal and development activities and $115 million for a onetime charge resulting from a third quarter change in the United Kingdom's supplementary income tax rate applicable to deductions for dismantlement expenditures.","Second quarter results included an after-tax impairment charge of $36 million. Excluding these items, the changes in after-tax components of the results were as follows: lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $132 million, higher operating costs decreased earnings by $32 million, lower exploration expense increased earnings by $17 million. All other items net to an increase in earnings of $13 million for an overall decrease in third quarter adjusted earnings of $134 million. The E&P effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2012 was 49%, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods.","Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining generated income of $53 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $8 million in the second quarter. Marketing earnings were $17 million in the current quarter and $18 million in the previous quarter. Port Reading refining operations generated income of $18 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $8 million in the second quarter, reflecting higher margins. Trading activities generated earnings of $18 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with a loss of $18 million in the prior quarter.","Turning to Corporate. Net corporate expenses were $38 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $39 million in the second quarter. After-tax interest expense was $66 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $64 million in the second quarter.","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter, including an increase of $530 million from changes in working capital, was $1,862,000,000. Capital expenditures were $2,160,000,000. Proceeds from the sale of Schiehallion were $524 million. Net debt repayments were $93 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $14 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $119 million.","We had $528 million of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2012, and $351 million at December 31, 2011. Total debt was $7,841,000,000 at September 30, 2012, and $6,057,000,000 at December 31, 2011. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30, 2012, was 27.5% compared with 24.6% at the end of 2011.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess my first question, I appreciate the update on the asset sale process, and I know you're not identifying specific assets. But could you range a proceed estimate or potential production impact for us? And also related, how much lower is 2013 capital spending as a result of the already announced asset sales, which I know had some related CapEx calls on them?","John B. Hess","In terms of our prospective divestitures, obviously, until they're successfully completed, we can't give specific details. We have a number underway right now. And obviously, as soon as the purchase sale agreements are signed and completed, we'll get that information out in a very timely manner. In terms of the asset sales that have occurred, John Rielly will be happy to give you some perspective.","John P. Rielly","Yes. So including the ones we've announced and the ones we've completed, which are Barrow, Schiehallion, Snohvit, ACG and Bittern, the 2013 production impact from these sales is estimated to be approximately 30,000 barrels a day. Our capital expenditures are estimated to be reduced by approximately $500 million, resulting from those sales. And our net cash flow will be reduced at an estimate of approximately $200 million from the sales.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. My second question would be, if you could just kind of walk us through your North Sea production in the quarter. I know you talked a little bit in the opening comments. But is it a bigger portion of the bead and how should we think about that going forward? Because production, overall, looks like it's trending at the higher end of your guidance.","John P. Rielly","The third quarter, I mean we had -- it was good production across the portfolio. So we had Valhall that was down for the majority of the quarter in the North Sea. But in general, the assets performed very well. I don't know if you were particularly asking about in the North Sea. So Schiehallion and Bittern actually closed right after the quarter end. So the impact in the fourth quarter from Schiehallion and Bittern will be about 11,000 barrels a day. That's what they produced in the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Do you have any update on where you are in terms of Bakken well costs, and how you think they're trending over the next year or so?","John B. Hess","Yes, thanks, Arjun. Let me provide some additional comments on the Bakken first, and I'll get right to your question. As John indicated in his opening remarks, our third quarter production averaged about 62,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was up 13% from the second quarter and 94% from the third quarter of 2011. Now we still expect production guidance for 2012 for the Bakken to average between 54,000 and 58,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Getting to your question, now that we're largely through HBP drilling, our main focus is on capital efficiency. And as a result, we've reduced average drilling complete cost to $9.5 million in the third quarter. That's reference to $13.4 million in the first quarter. The 29% reduction was primarily driven by the switch to providing fleet completion designs, which was used in nearly all of our wells in the third quarter. Looking forward in the fourth quarter, our HBP drilling will be substantially completed, and therefore, we expect to see further decreases in our average well costs as we transition to pad drilling. And currently, 15 of our 16 rigs are operating in pad drilling mode. The switch to pad drilling is going to allow us to further improve our capital efficiency and optimize the pace of development. Our approach is going to be to sequentially drill a number of wells on a pad using a walking rig; then once drilling operations are finished, we will move completion crews in to then sequentially fracture the wells. Now this will lead to the temporary flattening of the production profile until mid-2013, at which steady-state operations will allow us to resume our upward growth trajectory. So the production curve in 2013 will be a bit back-end loaded. Now we believe that this lean manufacturing approach will result in significant efficiency gains and cost savings and further improve our returns in the Bakken.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful and thorough answer, Greg. Are you still planning in doing the dual laterals? The $9.5 million, I'm pretty sure, is a single lateral well cost there.","Gregory P. Hill","It is. It is a single well cost. We're experimenting with co-planar dual laterals, but it's just a pilot. That's it.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see. So your base case plant is now single laterals, maybe similar to what other operators up there are doing. And $9.5 million is the starting point, you expect it to come down, that's how we should be thinking about it this?","Gregory P. Hill","It is, yes.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Any updates to then kind of individual well recovery rates and some of the type curve stuff you've talked about? Or can we take the dual lateral stuff you've given before and kind of divide those by 2?","Gregory P. Hill","No, I think the 30-day average IPs from this new sliding sleeve design, which is 25 to 34 stage, are slightly lower, they're 800 to 900 barrels equivalent per day. I think with regard to EURs, we continue to think that 500 to 600 is a good average used for the entire acreage position. However, as we focus on higher quality parts of the play in 2013, we expect EURs in the Middle Bakken to be closer to 600,000 to 700,000 barrels.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. Just a final question. I think John had alluded to some of the asset sales you've done and are planning. Do you have an updated total asset sales target you're working towards? I think you're already on track to well exceed your original guidance.","John B. Hess","As we said, Arjun, the number this year on prices is about $3 billion funding deficit. Next year, there'll be a significant decrease in that number. We'll be able to give more guidance on it on the next call as we talk about next year's capital and exploratory expense budget. But we're going to be reducing our CapEx and exploratory expenditures for next year significantly. So when we can announce that at the end of the year, we will. The deficit will be reduced accordingly, assuming current oil prices. And then we think by 2014, we'll be more in balance between operating cash flow and CapEx. So in terms of what it means in terms of asset sales, that's going to be much more a function of the sales we have underway and in early stages of planning and getting them executed. So more definition than that, I just can't give you right now. I can give you the contextual perspective, but I can't give you the specific answer until those sales are done.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But do you think about your asset sales as a funding gap issue, or is that we need to high grade and clean up the portfolio-type consideration?","John B. Hess","We're focusing our strategy to invest for future growth, focusing on lower risk, higher-return investments, obviously, led by the Bakken, but also the North Malay Basin and some of the focused exploration that we're doing because so much is to meet the upfront investment we need for the Bakken. It's just time for us to fund that with the assets that are either lower interest or more capital intensive, and so it's both to upgrade our portfolio, to have higher profitability and be more focused, but also to meet the funding needs that we have.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions for me. First, I was wondering if you could give me some more detail on the Port Reading rail receipt terminal capacity, expected CapEx, timing of first receipts of production if you've gotten that far along in your plan and then maybe how much it would cost to move a unit of production from the Bakken to that facility.","John B. Hess","Yes, a very fair question. We certainly have strategic geography available to us, I think, for a very attractive investment. Having said that, we're in the early stages of doing a feasibility study. So to give you more definition would be premature.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Understood. Well, it sounded very interesting, and good luck with that. Other question on Llano. I think you've received the Atwood Condor rig and are doing some development drilling there. I think you've got maybe 3 wells planned. Is that right? And what are you thinking as far as capital investment there and future production given the development drilling at Llano?","John B. Hess","We're still finalizing our drilling plans for Llano on a go-forward basis, but there are some targets in the Llano area that we're very interested in.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","So you would consider this more exploration or delineation-type drilling than development at this point?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, it's basically just in-field drilling, more delineation than it is exploration.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Any kind of predrill prospect size you could throw out there?","Gregory P. Hill","No, not yet because we haven't finalized the sequence.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I don't want to push too hard on the asset sales, but John, forgive me for this, but order of magnitude, you've announced I think about $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion so far. The asset sales still to go relative to that scale, is it similar size, much less, much more? How would you characterize it?","John B. Hess","Doug, fair question, and again I don't want to get ahead of our results. As soon as the asset sales are completed, we'll give you the details on them. Having said that, the intent is to meet the funding gap and also put some excess cash on the balance sheet. So that's the direction we're going. We have enough sales underway to help us get there, and we also have some other divestitures on top of that. So we should meet the funding gap and have some cash excess to boot.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is really -- there's a bit of a portfolio high grading going on in the background then, basically.","John B. Hess","Absolutely.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So a little follow-up to that. I think you said, certainly, to us in the past that net debt to cap target, somewhere closer to 20%. Is that still a good number?","John B. Hess","Yes, I don't want to just focus on that. Obviously, it'll be closer to where our debt cap was before we started the scaled-up investment program in the Bakken and have the higher capital exploratory program that we have this year. Another focus that we have though, Doug, is to really get our debt back to the levels that it was before the investment program, which is the equivalent of, let's say, about $6 billion because of some capitalized leases that we're going to have. The equivalent number, going forward, will be probably closer to $6.7 billion, but it's also a focus to keep our strong investment grade rating, so we can have the balance sheet to fund through the cycle and take the volatility of oil prices at the same time.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Just 2 very quick follow-ups then if I may. On the spending obviously, you've got a lot of infrastructure spending going. Your asset sales, I believe you've said in the past, that you expect to have everything announced pretty much by the end of the second quarter, albeit they may not be completed by the end of the year. But then after that, I think the discussion moves on to how else you can unlock value. And I think you're on record talking about potential for an MLP. I'm wondering if you could just give us some color as to what kind of assets in your portfolio would qualify. And final one for me is just an update on any hedging thoughts into these strong oil prices, and I'll leave it at that.","John B. Hess","Yes, a couple of perspectives on the funding gap. The majority of the sales will be some of our E&P assets as part of the portfolio high-grading that we're going through, which are either lower working interest, mature assets, maybe CapEx associated with them that we feel don't generate the returns that we'd like to see, maybe lower margin. It's a combination of all these factors that go in to our portfolio model to figure out what are the assets that we have for sale. And as I said, a number underway on the E&P side, as well as there are a number in early planning stages. So I'd say that's the first part. I also think that when you think about MLPs, the strategic infrastructure we have in North Dakota, having control of that adds a lot of value to our production, both on the oil side, and ultimately, the Tioga Gas Plant side for extracting liquids out of the natural gas we're going to have there, because Bakken associated gas is very rich in content of NGLs and LPGs. So that's not something that we would be interested in MLP-ing. There are some other assets that we have in the portfolio that we might think about MLP-ing, but our first priority right now is not that. The first priority is to address the E&P assets that we think don't fit us as much strategically. So we can really slim down and upgrade our portfolio on the E&P side.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And on hedging, John?","John B. Hess","Yes, on hedging. As we look forward, we think our balance sheet is in much better shape right now. So we can afford more price risk. So our intention is to take it. Having said that, if there are opportunities during the year where we think we can lock in some good prices just for next year, and basically, protect our cash flows, it's certainly something that has been and will continue to be given full consideration.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Faisel from Citi. We've seen a number of companies announce restructurings of their integrated sort of strategy as integrated oil companies, whether it's Murphy or Marathon or some other companies. I'm just wondering, can you discuss what the strategic rationale is for remaining sort of an integrated company, or is there a possibility that you could separate the retail and refining business, whatever's left of it, into a separate entity given that those assets trade higher multiples than where upstream assets trade today. And I have a follow-up after that.","John B. Hess","Very, very fair question. First of all, I have a lot of respect for these companies. We're not Murphy, we're not ConocoPhillips, and we're not Marathon. With the close of HOVENSA refinery, we've completed our transition to being a predominantly exploration, production company. Exploration production's over 90% of our capital employed; and marketing is, basically, the balance. Our energy marketing and retail marketing businesses remain a long-term strategic part of our portfolio that generate attractive returns, build upon our strong brand and offer selective growth opportunities. As I mentioned before, in terms of the portfolio reshaping that we're doing, the more material opportunities to meet our funding gap and to focus our portfolio to generate higher returns are on the E&P assets that do not meet our strategic criteria.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. But I mean how -- if these other assets, like retail and refining and logistics trade at higher multiples than upstream, how do you extract that value at the current...","John B. Hess","Well, we're really not in the refining business anymore. We just have the Port Reading cat cracker that's just a unique niche investment that we have that generated good returns in the third quarter. We'll keep running it as long as it makes good returns, number one. So the focus is marketing, which is really different part of the portfolio. And as I said before, it generates attractive returns, builds upon our strong brand and does offer some selective growth. So we're very happy having it in the portfolio, and it is a strategic part of the portfolio.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And just on exploration expense, I think you guys discussed how this was an expense number that was probably going to trend down over time. It looks like it gapped up a little bit in the third quarter, and we're still trending around almost $800 million, $900 million to $1 billion a year in exploration expense. What kind of -- where is this going to trend over time? It's still a very large number given the size of your company.","John P. Rielly","In that exploration expense number, I had mentioned the Peru asset write-off. That's where the pretax portion of that write-off is. So in that exploration expense number on a pretax basis is $86 million related to Peru. So that's why that number is a little higher this quarter.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So where did this number trend over time? And can you give us some concrete examples of how the activity levels have actually wound down a bit?","John B. Hess","Yes, year versus year, if you take the Peru out, obviously, it's trending down this year. But when we announce our budget next year, you'll see another material change to the downside. So as we announce our budget, you'll see more specifics on exploration expense and expenditures coming down. As Greg has said before, going forward, we're going to have a much more focused exploration program and less exposure to exploration as well. We're still going to be in the exploration business, but it'll be a lower dollar number.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The first question is for John Rielly. John, just want to understand, despite that very popular people on -- in the industry, people is spinning off their retail and all that. But is it true that, I mean, for in your case, that you -- the retail actually help you to utilize your IDC deduction? Without the retail operation, you actually are going to leave money on the table?","John P. Rielly","No, not specifically related to that, but we don't -- I mean, as John said, Retail and Energy Marketing are going to be a core part of our portfolio, and that will not impact our ability to take the 100% IDC write-off.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, no, I'm saying that, I mean that your IDC anyway, that you're generating so much even if you just deduct say, 50% or 75%, yet without the retail earning, you may not be able to fully utilize it.","John P. Rielly","I mean, absolutely. Anything that generates U.S. earnings, we can use the IDC write-off for. So because we have this additional write-off, as we can continue to generate more and more income in the U.S., could be on the downstream side, could be on the upstream side, makes those IDC write-offs much more valuable, correct.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So from that standpoint maybe that's the one strategic reason you may not want to spin off then?","John P. Rielly","Yes. I mean, again, as we overall look at that and look at the deductions that we have associated with that, and just as John said, I mean, when we look at it and put that portfolio together -- and I'm going to call it a risk-adjusted basis, it improves our overall portfolio returns on a risk-adjusted basis.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the second one that I just spoke, Greg. Greg, in Bakken, what is your current game plan for the number of rigs? I mean, you're going to focus on the capital efficiency. Does that mean that you're going to move down from the 18 rig into a lower number, say, by the end of the year into the next year? Or how should we look at it?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So, Paul, just to clarify, we have 16 rigs currently operating in the Bakken, 15 in pad drilling mode. I think as John has said and I've said before, as we focus on capital efficiency, we may moderate the pace slightly. But it won't be a major downward reduction in pace in the Bakken.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So we should still be looking at, at least, in the 14, 15 rigs?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we'll announce that as part of our 2013 guidance, but directionally, you're correct.","John B. Hess","But the key is, Paul, as you look at us going forward, the overall capital expenditures for next year will be materially down year versus year because of the improvements in operating efficiency and capital efficiency that Greg and his team have made, even if we run a rig count that's slightly less than this year.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And John and Greg, I mean when I'm looking at the third quarter, your U.S. lifting cost, unit lifting cost is going down. Should we -- base on that and deduct the conclusion that maybe in the Bakken, unit cash operating costs already reach their high watermark, and from this point on, it's going down?","John P. Rielly","We've been getting more and more efficient quarter-by-quarter in the Bakkens. And so right now, our Bakken costs are clearly below our portfolio average. They're slightly below our portfolio average and continuing to improve on our cash cost that way. And again, the more volume that we're getting and the more, again over time, development, that is continuing to trend that way.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, when you say that below your average portfolio you're talking about average U.S. or average total company?","John P. Rielly","Average total company. And that -- I'm saying that's inclusive of the production taxes that are up there in North Dakota, which are significant.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And how about on the unit DD&A, is it -- can we draw the same conclusion or not really?","John P. Rielly","You can draw the same conclusion that it will be on a declining path. But right now, on the unit DD&A as I had mentioned before, that is above our portfolio average. And again, early on in development of this, the reserve bookings lagged the investment dollars. So again, we've had a lot of infrastructure spend on top of the well cost. You don't get to book those full EURs upfront. But over time, the DD&A rate comes down, and that's what we're expecting to see and should start to see next year as well.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And in the third quarter, I think John has earlier mentioned, you guys did about 37,000 barrel per day of the unit train. Can you share with us then what kind of margin uplift on that 37,000-barrel per day may have been?","John P. Rielly","Yes, I can. So just in general, from our overall North Dakota-type production, so if you take all our production, not just that went by rail, we've got year-to-date about a $6 uplift in our price realizations in North Dakota.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Year-to-date, $6?","John P. Rielly","That's on our overall production, not just the amount that went by rail.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And John, can you give us some maybe, industry estimate or that your number in your retail network, October, the same store sales year-over-year, how is that looking like on the GAAP and inside?","John P. Rielly","For October, given the hurricane, I -- obviously, I don't think it's appropriate to even talk about it right now with all the suffering that's going on in the region that we live in, which has been impacted by the storm. But we're really one of the few operators open with all our stations working, save about 8 or 9 that are closed due to floods. With the generators we have, obviously, we've been open around the clock. Many of our stations have lines of 3 miles long. People have to wait 3 hours. If more operators were in business, obviously, would alleviate a lot of the panic buying that's going on. Having said that, in a number of situations, our gasoline sales are 2 to 3x what the normal amount would be.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And John Rielly, do you have any over-lift or under-lift in the quarter? And also at the end of the third quarter from an inventory standpoint, are you, at this point, normal?","John P. Rielly","There's no material under or over-lift in the quarter. And we are basically balanced here going into the fourth quarter. So we're not seeing any -- as we forecast, any material under or over-lift in the fourth quarter.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A final question is for Greg. Greg, from a strategic standpoint, when you're looking at Australian gas, you basically -- that in that Asia-Pacific just down there that you only have that discovery. So should that be really part of your -- from a capital efficiency and human capital efficiency standpoint, should that be part of your ongoing core operation, or that would be better off that since you make the discovery and just sell it to someone and focus your resources, your manpower, that there may be more concentrated areas?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Paul. So I think that the answer depends, obviously, on the commercial arrangements that we can negotiate with the 3 parties, again Chevron, Northwest Shelf and Pluto, Woodside and also the price that we get for that LNG. So the answer is going to depend upon returns and what that investment looks like. And that's how we're going to make the decision. I'm not worried about the capability to execute because it's all offshore drilling and development, which we're very good at.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And when are you going to make the decision? Any timeline you can share?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, I think we're still negotiating with the parties. So we aim to make the decision sometime next year. I think that's all I can say at this point.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Most everything's been asked. Regarding the Bakken, Greg, you mentioned that you're having your own improvements in terms of cost optimization, but what about services costs in general? Are you seeing a leg down on completion cost, rigs, et cetera?","Gregory P. Hill","I think, in general, relative to last year, our costs are flattish, I would say. Rigs, we're not seeing any significant downward pressure because of the high utilization there. I think we are seeing on the pumping services side, some downward pressure as supply is beginning to outstrip demand, but there's still upward pressure on labor costs in the Bakken. No major, major reductions in sight in the near term.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay, that's fine. And then any sort of update on the Gulf of Mexico, or just a lot of discussion, that's it?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think that's pretty much it. As we said, we're drilling Ness Deep with BHP, the operator and our 50% partner. And we anticipate TD-ing that well during the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","When I back out your Bakken, the growth in Bakken volumes year-over-year, it looks like the rest of your U.S. liquids production was down. Is that mainly Gulf of Mexico?","John P. Rielly","Yes, that would be Gulf of Mexico. And again, we did have that hurricane impact. So it was about 6,000 barrels a day of an effect in the quarter. And then typically again in the third quarter, we did have some maintenance as well.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you also share the year-over-year change in your Eagle Ford volumes?","John P. Rielly","It's really not material.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Not material.","John P. Rielly","No.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on the Utica, I guess you've been watching industry trends. It feels gassy to the east, and then there's a productive, I guess, liquids window around Noble, Harrison, Guernsey and some of Belmont. Have you had a chance to sort of update us on how much of your acreage that you acquired last year would be in that core liquids window?","John B. Hess","No, we haven't. And I think really, it's because we're still in the very early stages of appraisal of the Utica, not only us, but also industry. To kind of put that in context, that we have, for us, we only have 3 wells in the Utica versus more than 600 in the Bakken. So and the only extended production data that we have is from that initial North American Coal well in Jefferson County. I should say that well is a good well. It continues to produce at a constant 4 million a day, with a steady tubing pressure with significant surface facility constraints. Beyond that, we have 2 additional wells on our 100% acreage that are drilled that are waiting completion. And then our partner, CONSOL, has announced the results of 2 JV wells, one of which the Noble 1A flowed at a good rate, 9 million cubic feet a day initial rate. But given that very limited well mix, including industry, it's early in the appraisal stage. But I think based on what we've seen so far, and our acreage from a drilling standpoint and the very limited completions that we have, we remain optimistic about our position in the play.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, no, it certainly seems though that the play is developing. Very small one. On the European surprise, I mean, how much was Beryl, because I guess you're selling that. So how much did that produce in the quarter?","Gregory P. Hill","Okay, Beryl, I will get that in one second. Beryl, for the quarter, produced 13,000 barrels a day.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then I guess a general question coming back to CapEx, but not about projections. You spent about $2.5 billion internationally this year through, I guess, the first 9 months. And you gave us some good CapEx associated with some of the asset sales. But I mean is it possible just to give us a reminder of how much you spent, say, by region or assets, so that we can think about where CapEx may go? I'm very conscious that you've kind of finished Valhall and now moving into the drilling phase, there might be some savings there as well.","John P. Rielly","Sure. I mean I can just give you some highlights of the numbers. So Valhall this year was a significant capital requirement. So we are forecasting to spend approximately $750 million at Valhall this year. Also, if you're looking at the North Sea, we have South Arne. We have a development of a northern extension there, so we're spending approximately $200 million at South Arne in the North Sea. Some of the other just, in general, bigger assets. We have the Tubular Bells development that's going on in the U.S., so we expect to spend somewhere around $400 million in the Gulf of Mexico. We have the first of the 3 production wells drilled on that, and we'll continue drilling there next year. So you can expect -- if I was going to give you for next year, that some of the Valhall numbers will come down because of that redevelopment. South Arne will continue to drill, and so there will still be continued capital being spent in South Arne. Then in EG this year, we did pick up our drilling program again. We had kind of taken a hiatus there. We're spending about just under $500 million we forecast to spend in EG this year. So hopefully, that gives you a feel of where we're spending. But Like John Hess said earlier, we do anticipate next year a significant reduction in our overall capital spend.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, that's very helpful. And just then a follow-up that you bring up on EG. Is that sort of a 2-, 3-year program of spending at that level? Just I know that you're trying to some infill drilling to offset decline.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, that'll be another 2 years or so on EG. We continue to find excellent infill opportunities using 4D seismic with very high return investments.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Malone with Global Hunter Securities.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 questions. On the Bakken, the 37,000 BOE that you railed, if I heard correctly, that looks like a smaller proportion of the total production in the previous quarters. Is that going to come back up again, is that something specific to Q3? And where do you kind of see the proportion of rail to overall production going forward?","John B. Hess","Yes, on the rail side, that number is maybe at the lower end of what we might have anticipated, in part, because of some of the logistical disruptions from the Gulf Coast hurricane. Having said that, the number now is running closer to 45,000 barrels a day within a range of that number.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just overseas looking at Ghana. When do you think you'll be able to start talking about development options and plans for the discoveries you've made there so far?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So on Ghana, while we're encouraged by the results to-date, additional drilling's going to be required before we can really figure out the commerciality of the reserves that we have there. What we can say, we've said in the past, Paradise and Hickory North were predominantly gas-condensate discoveries in the Cenomanian and Beech and Almond were predominantly oil discoveries in Turonian-age reservoir. And as John mentioned in his opening remarks, we plan to drill 2 additional wells in Ghana, starting on the first one later in the fourth quarter.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one broader one last question. In the past, you talked about production guidance 395 to 4,000 or 5,000 BOEs a day. Obviously, a pretty stellar quarter this quarter has made that attainable. Are you sticking with that guidance, or do you think there's going to be at the high end? Or do you think you could exceed it?","Gregory P. Hill","I think we still feel good about our guidance. In the fourth quarter, we will be impacted by the continued shutdown of Valhall, which will now be shut in until mid-December, and then as John Rielly mentioned, in addition, we completed those Schiehallion and Bittern asset sales. So that's going to reduce our fourth quarter production by about 11,000 barrels a day versus Q3. So we feel pretty good about the guidance still.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kate Minyard with JPMorgan.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. Probably the first one is for John Rielly. Can you give us a sense as to the level of capitalized infrastructure so far in the Bakken? And also over what timeframe that's depreciated?","John P. Rielly","So for the Bakken right now, we plan on spending approximately $750 million this year on infrastructure. And again, that's going to be infill pipelines. You've got your gas plant. You've got the rail facility. And obviously, we had spent some of that beforehand. There's various rate years that are used for the DD&A. I'd say you've got a 20- to 25-type year depreciation on those facilities.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then prior to the $750 million in 2012, the total cumulative spending or maybe net infrastructure as of year-end '11 was -- do you have that?","John P. Rielly","So the total that -- I'm going to say pre-2011, and we've got 2012 costs and then we do have some carryover like the gas plant expansion that will be completed next year. We're talking about $1.2 billion worth of infrastructure spend. And that's related to the gas plant field compression, gathering systems, rail, our truck facility, so again all those type of facility investments, so up around $1.2 billion.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then I guess just for John Hess, you've made a couple of comments so far and I think on the prior conference call as well, about the portfolio reconfiguration moving to lower risk but also higher returns. And that's little bit of a more, maybe unusual move just to generate higher returns at lower risk. So how should we be thinking about measuring returns? And over what timeframe do you expect this to manifest in your results?","John B. Hess","Well, it's a work in progress, very fair question. As we reshape the portfolio, the majority of these asset sales will hopefully be completed in 2013, so really sort of the new rebased company would be starting in 2014. And while the production and reserve base will be lower, the unit profitability will be enhanced. So we also think that the reserve life will be enhanced, and the risk profile will be enhanced, so all of those together should be very helpful. And at the same time, we're limiting our exposure and refocusing our exploration efforts as well. So all of these, plus some other moves we're making, should improve our financial performance and make it lower risk and more sustainable. So between now and 2014, work in progress 2014, I think you'll really start to see those results shining, even though I think this quarter's results are an indication of what's to come in the future.","Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, all right. And should we look for measuring returns -- return on capital employed fair, or should we be thinking about return on equity? Or how are you guys thinking about it?","John B. Hess","Yes, return on capital employed, but when we invest money, as I've said before, we're looking for a 15% hurdle rate at $100 Brent. We tested at $80 for the cost of capital. And obviously, we want our investments to be better than that. We have to risk adjust it. So we use different criteria depending upon the risk within that framework that I mentioned. But that hopefully will be translated to improved financial performance as these investments bear fruit.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue.

My name is Towanda, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Towanda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements.","As usual, with me today are John Hess, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President, Worldwide Exploration and Production; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which, Greg Hill will provide an update on our activities in the Bakken. John Rielly will then review our financial results. This conference call at midyear is when we discuss our 2012 results and forecast in more detail. Just as important, this quarter also marks a midpoint and a period of important change for Hess.","Before getting into the details of the quarter, I would like to reflect on this change for a moment, as I think doing so will provide meaningful context to our current and expected future results. This change essentially began in 2009, and should be largely complete in 2014. In that relatively short span of 5 years, Hess has all but exited the refining business with the closure of the HOVENSA joint venture refinery, and we'll have shifted our Exploration and Production growth strategy from one based primarily on high impact exploration to one combining lower risk unconventional development opportunities such as the Bakken, along with the exploitation of existing discoveries like North Malay basin, and more focused and limited exposure to high-impact exploration such as Ghana and Ness Deep in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico.","This shift in Exploration and Production has required a substantial upfront increase in capital spend, largely related to the Bakken. Approximately 35% of this year's capital and exploratory expenditures are devoted to the Bakken compared to 11% in 2009. The majority of our total spend has been funded with cash flow from operations. Any shortfall has been and is expected to be funded mostly, if not entirely, through asset sales as we rebalance our oil and gas reserve and production portfolio in favor of lower risk, geographically more secure and higher return assets.","At current oil prices, the gap between cash flow and capital expenditures should peak this year at about $3 billion, moderate substantially next year and approach a balance in 2014. Asset sales should be largely completed by year-end 2013. We expect that the reserve and production base established as a consequence of these actions will be lower than the levels likely to be achieved in 2012. However, the profitability of those barrels on a per-unit basis should be higher than is currently the case. With the feedback gained each day through the execution of our strategy, we feel ever more confident that this portfolio reshaping is the right course for our company.","Certainly, there have been and will continue to be difficult learning experiences along the way, but we are convinced of the strategy, committed to its successful execution and believe it will lead to improved financial performance.","With that as an introduction, we will now cover the details of the quarter.","Net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $549 million. Compared to the year-ago quarter, our earnings were positively impacted by higher crude oil sales volumes and improved Marketing and Refining results, but were negatively impacted by lower realized crude oil selling prices and higher operating cost in Exploration and Production.","Exploration and Production earned $644 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 429,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 15% increase over the year-ago quarter. Higher production from the Bakken in North Dakota, the Llano Field in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Libya was partially offset by natural field declines in Equatorial Guinea.","In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken averaged 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter compared to 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 120%. For the full year 2012, we now forecast net Bakken production to average between 54,000 and 58,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In April, we commenced operation of our crude oil rail loading facility and shipped an average of 29,000 barrels per day during the quarter to higher value markets. At the Llano Field in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where Hess has a 50% interest, a successful work-over was performed on the Llano #3 well, which had been shut in for mechanical reasons since the first quarter of last year. The well was brought back online in May, and in June, net production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In Libya, net production averaged 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. In last year's second quarter, the fields were shut in due to civil unrest. Given the political uncertainty in Libya earlier in the year, we chose to exclude Libya from our original 2012 production forecast. However, since production has been restored, we will now include Libya in our revised production financial forecast.","At the Valhall Field in Norway, net production averaged 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. BPV operator has informed us that the field be shut in for approximately 90 days compared to their original forecast of 30 days, which will result in 2012 net production averaging 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus our previous expectation of 20,000 to 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Major field redevelopment work is now expected to be completed by the end of this year and development drilling will resume in 2013. As a consequence of these factors and the strong overall performance of our portfolio, we now forecast 2012 production for our company to average between 395,000 and 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which includes the addition of approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent today -- per day from Libya, which was excluded from our previous forecast of between 370,000 and 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In June, we signed agreements with PETRONAS to develop 9 discovered natural gas fields in the North Malay basin. Located offshore Peninsular Malaysia and adjacent to Hess' interest in the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area. This project is consistent with our strategy to invest in long-life, low-risk reserves with attractive financial returns in exploration upside. Hess will have a 50% working interest and become operator of the project.","The project will require a net investment for Hess of approximately $250 million in 2012. First production is forecast to commence in 2013 at a net rate of approximately 40 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and increase in 2015 to an estimated 125 million cubic feet per day.","With regard to exploration in Ghana, Hess concluded drilling operations on the Hickory North well in June. The well encountered approximately 100 net feet of gas condensate pay. We recently completed drilling our beach prospect, located 5 miles north of the Paradise location and are conducting wire line logging.","The Stena DrillMAX drillship will next drill our Oman prospect located 20 miles west of Hickory North. Offshore Brunei, the Jagus East well on Block CA-1, in which Hess has a 13.5% interest, encountered hydrocarbons. This well, along with the previously announced Julong East discovery, is being evaluated and additional exploration and appraisal drilling is planned in 2013.","In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, on June 12, we spud the Ness Deep well located on Green Canyon 507. This is a Miocene prospect in which Hess has a 50% working interest. BHP holds the remaining 50% and is the operator. The well is anticipated to take approximately 160 days to drill.","Turning to Marketing and Refining, reported net income of $8 million for the second quarter of 2012. Refining generated earnings of $8 million versus a loss of $44 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a positive contribution from our Port Reading facility in the second quarter and the shutdown of the HOVENSA joint venture refinery early in this year.","Marketing earnings of $18 million included an $11 million after-tax charge for environmental liabilities compared to $28 million in last year's second quarter. Retail marketing benefited from declining wholesale prices during the second quarter, which resulted in improved fuel margins.","Gasoline volumes on a per-site basis were down approximately 3%, while total convenience store sales were down nearly 6% versus last year's second quarter, reflecting the continued weak economy. In Energy Marketing, natural gas and oil volumes were lower versus last year, while electricity volumes were higher.","Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first half of 2012 were $4.1 billion, substantially all of which were related to Exploration and Production. For the full year 2012, our capital and exploratory expenditures forecast has been increased to $8.5 billion from $6.8 billion. Over half of the increase is due to activities in the Bakken with the balance related to Valhall, Tubular Bells and our recently announced investment in the North Malay basin.","Although our 2013 capital and exploratory budget will not be finalized until the end of the year, we plan to make significant reductions below 2012 levels and be more aligned with expected cash flow. As I said previously, we expect that internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales will fund most, if not all of our 2012, 2013 capital and exploratory expenditures.","Year-to-date, we have announced asset sales totaling more than $850 million, which includes the sale of our interest in the Schiehallion field in the United Kingdom to Shell for $503 million, as well as the previously announced sale of our interest in the Snohvit Field in Norway and the Bittern Field in the United Kingdom. Addition to asset sales of $1 billion to $2 billion are well underway, and details will be announced as soon as terms are finalized. Further asset sales have been identified and are in the early stages of divestiture.","I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill.","Gregory P. Hill","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide a few remarks about the Bakken. We're continuing our transition in the Bakken during 2012, from higher cost 38-stage hybrid completions in HBP drilling to lower cost 34-stage sliding sleeve in-fill drilling. In the first quarter, nearly 70% of our wells were hybrid wells with an overall average drilling complete cost of $13.4 million per well.","During the second quarter, only 40% of our wells were hybrids with an overall average drill and complete cost of $11.6 million, a reduction of 13%. Looking forward to the second half, our HBP drilling will be substantially completed by year end, and 100% of our wells will be sliding sleeve wells by the fourth quarter leading to an estimated drilling complete cost of under $10 million.","Second quarter production averaged 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 30% from the first quarter and 120% from the second quarter of 2011. Our higher second quarter production reflects working off our completion backlog and the drilling of higher working interest wells.","We expect 2012 net production to average between 54,000 and 58,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which implies net production will average between 60,000 and 68,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second half of 2012. Our 2012 capital budget for the Bakken has been increased to about $3 billion from $2 billion previously.","There are 4 primary drivers for this increase. The first driver is our decision to drill in higher working interest areas, reflecting an average working interest of approximately 80% versus a budgeted 62%, and to drill additional wells in 2012. While these changes will result in increased capital spending of approximately $500 million, they will also allow us to substantially complete our HBP drilling in 2012, and accelerate production growth that will partially offset the lower-than-planned production experienced during the first quarter.","The second driver is an overall increase in drilling and completion cost, which are now expected to average approximately $11 million per well in 2012 versus our original budget of approximately $8.5 million. Now these cost increases are due to the need to use ceramic proppant instead of white sand caused by market shortages earlier in the year, coupled with a slower-than-anticipated transition to full sliding sleeves. While higher well costs will result in additional capital spending of approximately $300 million, we still expect to generate attractive financial returns.","The third driver is increased infrastructure spend associated with the gas plant and gathering systems due to design changes and higher labor costs, which will increase capital spending by approximately $150 million.","The final driver is higher-than-budgeted non-operated drilling spend from additional wells and also higher non-operated well costs, resulting in additional capital spending of approximately $100 million.","In closing, it's important to note that we're still relatively early in the overall development of the Bakken. We are building a long-term business from a large high-quality acreage position and competitively advantaged infrastructure. As we move forward, we expect significantly lower capital cost through further well cost reductions, through the completion of the major infrastructure projects, including the Tioga Gas plant in 2013, and through improved capital efficiency as we complete the transition from HBP to pad drilling.","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare second quarter 2012 results to the first quarter.","The corporation generated consolidated net income of $549 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $545 million in the first quarter. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the corporation had earnings of $585 million in the second quarter, compared with $509 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production had income of $644 million into the second quarter of 2012, compared with $635 million in the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2012, the corporation and a joint venture partner agreed to exchange interest in properties in the Eagle Ford Shale in the United States and the Paris Basin in France. As a result, the corporation recorded an after-tax charge of $36 million to reduce the carrying value of the exploration properties that are expected to be divested in the exchange.","First quarter results included an after-tax gain of $36 million related to the sale of the corporation's interest in the Snohvit Field offshore Norway. Excluding these items, the changes in after-tax components of the results were as follows: higher sales volumes increased earnings by $161 million; lower selling prices decreased earnings by $61 million; lower exploration expense increased earnings by $37 million; higher operating cost, primarily depreciation, depletion and amortization, decreased income by $61 million; all other items net to an increase in earnings of $5 million for an overall increase in second quarter adjusted earnings of $81 million.","Our E&P operations were overlisted [ph] in the quarter compared with production, resulting in increased after-tax income of approximately $25 million. The E&P effective income tax rate for the second quarter of 2012 was 47%, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods.","In July 2012, the government of the United Kingdom changed the supplementary income tax rate applicable to deductions for dismantlement expenditures from 32% to 20%, with an effective date of March 12, 2012. As a result, we expect to record a onetime charge in the third quarter of 2012 of approximately $100 million to increase the deferred tax liabilities related to asset retirement obligations in the United Kingdom.","For the full year of 2012, we expect our normalized E&P effective tax rate to be in the range of 44% to 48%. This forecast reflects the resumption of operations in Libya.","Full year 2012 unit costs are now expected to be $39 to $41 per barrel of oil equivalent produced, down from our previous guidance of $40.50 to $42.50 per barrel. E&P cash operating costs are still expected to be in the range of $20 to $21 per barrel, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses are now expected to be in the range of $19 to $20 per barrel.","Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining generated income of $8 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $11 million in the first quarter. Marketing earnings were $18 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $22 million in the first quarter, principally reflecting seasonally lower Energy and Marketing earnings and an after-tax increase in environmental liabilities of $11 million, partially offset by improved retail gasoline margins.","In Refining, Port Reading operations generated income of $8 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with a loss of $6 million in the first quarter, reflecting higher margins. Trading activities generated a loss of $18 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with a loss of $5 million in the first quarter.","Turning to Corporate. Net Corporate expenses were $39 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $38 million in the first quarter. After-tax interest expense was $64 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $63 million in the first quarter.","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter, including a decrease of $334 million from changes in working capital was $1,240,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,978,000,000. Net borrowings were $803 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $52 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $13 million.","We had $409 million of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2012, and $351 million at December 31, 2011. Total debt was $7,845,000,000 at June 30, 2012, and $6,057,000,000 at December 31, 2011. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at June 30, 2012 was 28.2% compared with 24.6% at the end of 2011.","As John has mentioned, total full year capital spend is now expected to be approximately $8.5 million. The increase is primarily in 4 areas. Greg Hill has just explained  the increase in Bakken capital spending. The remaining drivers for the increase relate to the recently sanctioned project in the North Malay basin, which added $250 million; cost increases for the Valhall redevelopment project of $200 million; and accelerated spend of $100 million at the Tubular Bells deepwater development due to the early arrival of the rig.","We plan to fund most, if not all, of our capital program with cash flow from operations and anticipated proceeds from the asset sales previously mentioned by John Hess. We are currently using our available credit facilities to fund our capital program until the asset sales are completed.","At June 30, 2012, we have $2.2 billion of outstanding borrowings under available credit facilities with additional committed credit capacity of $4.3 billion.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","John Hess, you referenced you coming moderate to -- well, you expected the net out spend for 2013 to moderate substantially next year. I just want to see if you could be a little bit more specific. I know you've got to go through budgeting and everything, but just is there a way to give us some sort of range, plus or minus $1 billion for 2013?","John B. Hess","No, I can't, for the very reasons that you said, but I will say and repeat, that we plan to make significant reductions below 2012 levels for our capital and exploratory expend. In 2013, we're going to have flexibility in the Bakken for the reasons Greg said, going from HBP to pad drilling. Also the change in completion. Also a lot of the infrastructure investment will be behind us. Also some of the assets that we're selling, like Schiehallion, will also allow us to get rid of some capital expenditures that we previously had been obligated to spend money on. There are other such things that we're considering selling now. And as the specifics of those asset sales are done, we'll be able to give more granularity, if you will, to the projection for next year. But with the significant reductions below 2012 levels and also the cash flow that we expect to get from our production operations, we will be much more aligned with expected cash flow going into 2013 and then pretty much in balance in 2014. So those are the conceptual points. I can't be more specific at this time, which I'm sure you understand.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I understand. When you think about balance for 2014 though, what oil price do you assume?","John B. Hess","Well, we test it down to $80 Brent, but you could assume something in the $90 to $100 Brent range as you think about it conceptually.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then, conceptually, do you think your capital program will be more flexible and variable going forward, now that you complete drilling the hole, the acreage in the Bakken, will you dial it up or back down?","John B. Hess","Yes, we will have more flexibility. I think that's a fair statement. Also you've got to remember, we're going to have a number of fields that we're investing in now, like Tubular Bells and North Malay basin and also the continued investment in the Bakken that should generate more production in 2014. So we'll have more cash flow in 2014, from money -- from projects that we're spending money on right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, can I just [indiscernible] asset sales, please. I just wanted to clear on your prepared remarks. Did you say an additional $1 billion to $2 billion?","John P. Rielly","Yes, an additional $1 billion to $2 billion are well underway and the details from those activities will be announced as soon as the terms are finalized. But I also said that above and beyond that, further asset sales have been identified and are in the early stages of divestiture.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. You made a comment about this pipe production. Can you -- I mean, we could all take a stab at, I guess, the Eagle Ford restructuring and you previously said small working interest, I guess, that would -- that make [indiscernible] on the block but these are fairly small in terms of production impact. So can you help us with the order of magnitude as to what production is associated with these asset sales?","John B. Hess","Fair enough, Doug. Again, I can't because these things are underway. Some may succeed, some may not happen. But we have a number underway. So again, the specifics of that I only could do once the sales details are finalized, but I think the real important takeaway there is that while the reserve and production base that we have right now will likely be lower than the levels that we have now in 2012, the profitability of those barrels on a per-unit basis should be higher as is currently the case. So the important thing is we're going to be shedding assets that are either smaller interest, that have capital investments associated with them that maybe not as attracted to us, maybe they're in mature areas as well. And we're going to be reinvesting those proceeds and assets that offer lower risk, higher returns and more sustainable growth. So we're confident that these reshaping moves will improve our financial performance and really create long-term value for our shareholders.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Before, with the asset sales, John, just to be clear, you're expecting all of this to be received in the Board by the end of this year?","John B. Hess","No, it probably -- we may announce all of it by the end of the year, if we are fortunate enough, but more likely than not, some of the proceeds, in terms of receiving the cash, may end up coming in 2013. That's why I said that the asset sales should be largely completed by year-end 2013.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. If I could take a second one, on the Bakken, maybe to John -- to Greg, sorry. As regards your Bakken production, Greg, 55,000 in the second quarter suggest that June, or at least the exit rate must have been a fairly punchy number. Can you give us some idea as to how -- where production stands right now, and maybe talk a little bit about what the impact will be if moving to whole sliding sleeve in terms of completion stages, and maybe talk a little bit about how the well results have been coming in, although [ph] they still look pretty good to us?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Well, thanks, Doug. So current rates in the Bakken are just shy of 60,000 right now as we speak. You mentioned that we are very pleased with the wells. The 165 30-plus stage wells that we drill, the average IPs are 900 barrels a day, and we're particularly pleased, when you look at the NDIC data, that passes drilled 7 of the top 25 wells in the play in the first 4 months of 2012. We're in transition to the sliding sleeves. And as I said in my opening remarks, really, by the fourth quarter, we'll be in 100% sliding sleeve mode in the Bakken. So obviously, that offers significant advantages in terms of timing, as well as a reduction in completion costs.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. If I can just squeeze one more in, then I'll leave it there. You mentioned that you're going to be logging beach. I'm guessing you don't log dry holes, Greg. So can you give us some idea as to what the plans going forward could be for Ghana? And I'll leave it at that.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Doug, I've got to be very careful here because obviously, we can't outrun the government. So anything we really announce about Ghana has to be approved by the government. So suffice to say, you're right, we wouldn't be logging something if it was a dry hole. So that's about all I can say.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, maybe talking broader CapEx question. I know the market isn't very focused on CapEx increases and I think your stock is pressing real value disruption. And just on a higher level question, you mentioned improved returns, but can you quantify your expected returns of these capital projects, meaning when Hess that's global opportunities or spending decisions? Can you just describe your process and your hurdle rates and kind of how you stress your downside returns? I know you mentioned your implied Brent outlook.","John B. Hess","Yes, we look for cost of capital, meaning 10%, testing it down to $70 and $80 Brent. Number one, our hurdle rate's 15%. Obviously, when you talk about our hurdle rate, you've got to take risk into account as well. So for certain projects, we're higher than 15%, but lower risk, long-life returns it'll be a bit lower than that, but generally, it's 15% hurdle rate.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then maybe somewhat related, I mean, just on the price-to-reserve basis or other [indiscernible] significantly below implied F&D and your CapEx number and I know that's not perfect analysis, yet it's just clearly historically wide. I mean, how do you think about weighing buybacks, given the paper value versus investment decisions in this calculus?","John B. Hess","Well, right now, what we're focused on is making the investment reposition the portfolio for lower risk, more profitable growth led by the Bakken, but by the other parts of our strategy that I talked about, it's a more balanced, lower risk approach to profitable growth. Obviously, because we're in the investment mode now, due to, predominantly, to the Bakken, we are going to use, predominantly, if not all, asset sales to make up the funding gap and get more balanced. After we get more balanced, then how we use our cash going forward will be a decision that we make where we can find the best way to invest our money for our shareholders.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And maybe just one last if I could. I mean, it's -- I mean, clearly topical across the sector, it seems like everything imaginable is ending up in an MLP. I mean, you have some more conventional midstream assets, you spend a lot on infrastructure in the Bakken and with potential organic growth behind it, which is, recently tax enhancement, how do you -- I mean, any thoughts on how do you think about that vehicle as a potential sourcing of money?","John B. Hess","It's certainly an idea that we weigh against continuing to invest in infrastructure. The Bakken infrastructure we have is really advantaged because of the upstream higher revenues that we get. Because we have significant size and scale in the Bakken, it gives us competitive position. So that doesn't necessarily mean that MLP would be the most advantageous in the long run to do. So the point is it's something we look at but at the end of the day, I think you have to look at it play-by-play as opposed to just saying do an MLP for all your midstream assets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the increase in capital spending in the Bakken, from what you initially guided in January and versus where you are now, how do you guys get comfortable that this is the last increase we're going to see this year, and that as we go to through the end of the year, we're not going to see any further increases?","John B. Hess","Well, I think if you look at the trends, I mean, clearly, our costs are coming down. As I said, on our well costs in particular, obviously, the first quarter well costs were high, driven a lot by the sliding -- or sorry, the plug and perf wells. And in the second quarter, we dropped our well costs by 13%, and we expect that trend to continue as we go through the year. And obviously, as we continue to complete infrastructure, that helps as well. Yes, and the final thing is by year end, we'll be out of HBP mode and largely in infill drilling mode as we move into 2013. So there's some obvious advantages there.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then as you guys look at your overall capital expenditure budget, what level of capital do you guys think you need to spend in order to keep production flat?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, we're not really giving that guidance right now. And let me tell you why. Now that we're nearing the end of HBP mode, what we are doing is we're doing a comprehensive development strategy for the Bakken. So this a long-term development strategy with a goal of maximizing profitability and capital efficiency. And so the results of that study will be used to optimize the drilling program in 2013 and beyond.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, in the Bakken, I think you gave us some data points in terms of the drilling times for your wells, has that -- can you give us some trend data on that -- on those wells today, where you were versus last quarter?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, that's pretty much stayed the same. So there haven't been major improvements in drilling time Q1 to Q2. I mean, obviously, as we move, again, out of HBP mode and more into pad drilling, you can expect some reductions there because the numbers we quote are spud-to-spud. So that includes all the movement of the rigs that occurs between locations.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And on your sort of prepared remarks and how you expect to spend less CapEx next year, does any of that reduction in capital spending affect your long term kind of production growth guidance?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, again, I think, specific to the Bakken, again, I think, to say again, we're in the process of completing this comprehensive long-term development strategy for the Bakken. Again, our goal there is maximizing profitability and capital efficiency, and the output of that model will really dictate what those future curves look like.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last question for me. Do you guys plan to hold an analyst meeting to discuss all these changes and the details and kind of how you guys are spending capital over the next few years?","John B. Hess","We obviously have an active Investor Relations program. We will continue to. Certainly, at the right time, we will consider hosting our own company investor meeting. We're happy to do that. But at the same time, we're going to do everything we can with Jay, Greg, myself, John Rielly to get out and see investors one-on-one as much as possible so they really can get their questions answered and better understand our strategy and our commitment to it. And the whole focus will be getting our cap expenditures under control. We have a plan for that, and then it's up to us to execute it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could just slightly triangulate some of the things you've been saying, John. I think, basically, the long-term outcome from all these moving parts that we just referenced is that you will be cash flow, you said I think, basically breakeven in 2014. And if I kind of triangulate that against another statement was you'd be cash flow breakeven in 2014, on an assumption of a $90 to $100 Brent?","John B. Hess","Let's just assume $100 Brent there.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So basically, that's where we'll end up once this whole process has kind of worked its way through, and that would be a 15% return?","John B. Hess","I'd said, our projects, Paul, when we invest money, our hurdle rate's 15%.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I understand. Okay. If we could just come back to the guidance for 2012, now on volumes. Could you just run through the moving parts again because I guess, at its interest [ph] level, you were at a much higher current level of production than what you've said you'll achieve for the full year?","John P. Rielly","Sure, Paul. In the third quarter, we're going to be impacted by the normal North Sea facilities maintenance. That happens every third quarter. But in addition to that, we have a shutdown of the Llano Field for 45 days due to the maintenance at the Auger platform. And as well, John has mentioned in his remarks, we now have a 3-month shut-in of the Valhall Field. So that's approximately 25,000 barrels a day that'll be impacting us. In addition, Conger is going to be down for maintenance as well at Enchilada in the third quarter. So what you're seeing from that guidance is the impact in the third quarter and then the fourth quarter production should be back where we're seeing it right now.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then that hopefully can get me down to the -- I guess it's a 4 or 5 upper end of the range guidance that you've got for the full year?","John P. Rielly","We're not guiding within the range but it's 3 95 to 4 05. And again, we're coming into hurricane season and things like that. So from a guidance standpoint, we feel comfortable now narrowing the range to 3 95 to 4 05 for the full year.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. I guess, with the level of disposals that you're talking about, it's going to be hard for you to talk about an outlook for volume growth. I wondered if you could, and if you can talk about that, that would be great, but I assume that it's going to be very tough with all the moving parts. It does seem that you stated quite clearly that you're very committed to the Bakken. Could you talk more about the volume outlook there for the longer term again for us? I'm thinking back to my 2014-type balance cash flow, I just wonder what's the volumes you're looking for now from the Bakken over the longer term?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, again, Paul, our 2013 budget, and that includes production, won't be finalized until later this year. And I want to say again, we're in the process of completing this comprehensive long-term development strategy now that we're nearing HBP for the Bakken. There's a lot of things to consider into the wells, the learning that we've gotten from all the areas that we've drilled in. And again, the focus of that study is going to be to maximize profitability and improve capital efficiency. So when the results of that study are done, we're obviously going to be -- use that to optimize the drilling program in 2013 and beyond. So not comfortable giving any kind of capital or volume estimates until we're really done with that study. We're at a point now in the Bakken where we've learned a lot, and now it's time to look forward and say how do we really want to develop this asset.","John B. Hess","All focused on capital efficiency and focusing on returns.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So we should think about the -- really, as you stated, the primary balance here will be that you'll be cash flow balanced in 2014. The volume that results from that will be an outcome.","John B. Hess","Yes. And the volume also that results from that will be a function of which assets we end up selling, and I think the important thing there is we deliver growth. Sometimes people say shrink to grow. That's not our case. I think that's more the case with the major oil companies that maybe have a little more challenge in their growth profile. We can grow from our current base, but we've got to spend a lot more money. By reducing our portfolio to the more profitable assets, we still deliver pretty respectable growth. The exact number of that, we can't give you until we get the asset sales behind us. But the key to that, we'll be able to live within our means and deliver, I think, very attractive financial returns on a going-forward basis. As I said, while the base of reserves and production going forward will be less subsequent to the asset sales, obviously, than they are now, the profitability on a per-unit basis, the cash margin on a per-unit basis will be higher as we go forward. And I think that focus on profitability is the key takeaway here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, you mentioned the repositioning of Hess and the asset sales you're pursuing and your commitment to the basic strategy. Curious if you still want to be as globally diversified as you are right now, or could some of the asset sales you're considering, and it sounds like it could be more than the $1 billion to $2 billion that have already been outlined, could that exit you out of an area? Do you want to be onshore U.S., Deep Gulf, North Sea, Russia, Southeast Asia, West Africa, maybe in Australia, do all those areas really make sense for Hess at its current size and growth and profitability aspirations?","John B. Hess","Arjun, as opposed to looking at it just purely geographically, I would look at it by asset and what the profitably and investment required for that profitability is by that asset. Sometimes, it's the country, sometimes it's an asset within the country. Obviously, we have a comprehensive program here. And a number of the areas you mentioned are going to be considered within that, to bring more focus to our portfolio, to be more profitable so that then we could invest in the growth projects that deliver the best returns.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. A couple -- you mentioned the potential for CapEx to come down in '13, and I think yourself and your colleagues gave some detail, but Utica shale, if you have success, that sounds like it could be additive, Pony\/Knotty Head presumably will be sanctioned at some point in time. Australia LNG is a potential project. It feels like there could be additions as well or perhaps some of those might be in the divestiture category?","John B. Hess","Yes. Arjun, again, we'd like to have a high-class problem that -- or opportunity. I should say that some of the one you mentioned would be sanctioned for development and investment because that would mean it has good returns. Having said that, a number of the things we're selling will be getting rid of capital obligations in the future. So all of that is modeled into the guidance conceptually that we're giving you.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Makes sense. And then just lastly, can you talk about hedging strategy going forward? You had some hedges, they rolled off, you added some this year. Will that be part of your ongoing program going forward?","John B. Hess","Yes. As a general concept, we want to keep a strong balance sheet, live within our means and be able to give our shareholders the benefit of oil prices. And obviously, sometimes, they go down. So you have to have a strong enough balance sheet and also live within your means to be able to absorb the ups and downs. Having said that, as we look at the funding gap that we have this year and with the investment program we have this year, we thought it very prudent to take the risk out of some of our revenues and cash flows to be sure that we can fund through the cycle. So hedging as a concept will always be an option for us. We only did it for this year. We don't know where oil prices are going to be next year. We're not sure exactly where the asset sales are going to be, what our CapEx is going to be, even though it's going to be less of a funding gap next year. So it is an option that will always be on the table. So we will consider it year by year. Having said that, as we get our balance sheet in order, as we live within our means, we're going to be more able to absorb the ups and downs of oil prices.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick follow on from Arjun. Do you think you can get the CapEx with the sales and back in becoming more efficient below the $6.8 billion that you were originally going for this year?","John B. Hess","I don't want to go there simply because there are moving pieces in the asset sales that we have. But by definition, where we are right now is the peak of our CapEx, and we're going to make significant reductions for next year. And when we're in a position to give you the details of that, which will be in that fourth quarter conference call most likely, in January of 2013, we will give it. But as soon as we're in a position to give that specific number, we will give it to you.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and then 2 follow ons for Greg. I don't know if you can share any of the latest Eagle Ford sort of IP rates from your recent well cost. And if you've had any further wells drilled in the Utica?","Gregory P. Hill","Sorry, I was on mute. Let me do the Utica first. So again, on the Utica, we've got 2 wells in the ground. One was the well that we completed. Remember, on our Marquette acreage, that was the 11 million cubic feet a day well. That well is on. It's facility constrained, pipeline constrained, and producing about 3 million to 4 million cubic feet a day. So variously, in very low pressure drops, it's a good well, it's a good high-rate well. The second well that's been drilled is over on the far west and that's a CONSOL well. That well is waiting on rod pump, artificial lift. So we'll see what that well is going to produce. And then we're in various stages of drilling, really, both CONSOL and us in various stages of drilling additional wells. So no results to report on those yet just because we're still in the drilling stage on all of them. I think just a general statement about the Utica, we remain pretty pleased and pretty optimistic when you take into account what we've seen albeit limited and what industry is seeing. We feel -- we still feel good about our acreage position in Utica. In regards to the Eagle Ford, on our retained acreage. So this is the Cotulla area. We've now got 43 wells in the ground, of which, 40 are now on production. Only 34 of these have 30-day IPs, and those range between 250 and 650 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Production in June is averaging about 4,000 barrels a day net to us, and that's 2\/3 liquids. So that gives you some sense or some color of the Utica results to date -- sorry, the Eagle Ford.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just one smaller question around the Bakken, in terms of its variability in working interest. Obviously, in the first quarter, it was low. In the second quarter, it was high. How does that process work in terms of -- is it your choice or is it around the working interest that the partners are taking in the wells?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Well, it's a mixture of both because, of course, we -- as part of our lean manufacturing process, we nominate or put wells in our schedule, really about 18 months in advance, right? So we have a 12- to 18-month drilling schedule that we're planning to. And of course, in that, we know the working interest, assuming a certain level of participation by the other party. Now if somebody elects to go nonconsent on a well, obviously, that working interest will float up in that particular well. So our forecast are based upon this 80% average working interest, which assumes that most of the partners participate in the well. Obviously, if people elect not to, that working interest will float up over time.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And as you're thinking about the 54 to 58, there potentially could be some upside if you could get a higher working interest in those wells or is that sort of adjusted in the guidance?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, it's sort of adjusted in the guidance. But if you look at the annual impact of that, it's going to be fairly small, right?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Some quick ones on the Bakken. You changed your completion techniques. Any difference with EURs?","Gregory P. Hill","No, John. We've done quite a study actually comparing plug and perf\/hybrid to sliding sleeves and we see no difference. Now having said that, we're still early in the type curve phase, but certainly, there's no difference between the performance of the wells.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Are you engaging in control flowback techniques to increase EURs?","Gregory P. Hill","In the Utica or in the Eagle Ford?","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Both.","Gregory P. Hill","Well, in the Utica, yes. What we do is we shut in the well for an extended period of time. The nature of the Utica is quite different than the Bakken, but in the Bakken, no. No, we don't.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay, Ghana, you mentioned that Hickory [ph] with gas condensate, is it retrograde?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, it is, yes.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. And last one for me is Australia. Any other news with respect to that? You haven't mentioned anything.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So Australia, we recently completed our appraisal drilling and testing campaign on our WA-390-P block. That appraisal campaign included 4 wells and 5 DSPs and has yielded some pretty important information for future development. For example, we were able to successfully drill the first offshore horizontal well in Australia, which will reduce the number of development wells required for the project, and the DSDs also confirmed good reservoir continuity, high flow rates and minimal contaminants in the gas stream. One final point I'd make is the Australian government's granted a major project facilitation status to us, and that really streamlined some assistance during approvals in order for a development decision to be reached. And as has been ongoing for several months, as you all know, the commercial discussions with all the potential liquefaction partners are ongoing. So that's our next step really.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Are you thinking about bringing in an equity partner? We're seeing that with a lot of the deals for LNG in Asia. Are you considering that?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we're considering it. And obviously, like all LNG deals, typically, if you have a buyer, a certain percentage of the equity in the gas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have to apologize that I came in a bit late. So if you already covered it, just let me know, I will check the transcript later on. Greg, have you given any well cost on the Bakken and Eagle Ford in the second quarter?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Paul. Actually, in my opening remarks. In the first quarter, this is related to hybrids and sliding sleeves, so in the first quarter, nearly 70% of our wells were hybrid wells with an overall average drilling complete cost of $13.4 million per well. Now during the second quarter, only 40% of our wells for those hybrids or overall average drilling complete cost was $11.6 million. So that's reduction at 13%. And then looking forward to the second half, our HBP drilling wells will be substantially completed by year end, and then 100% of our wells will be sliding sleeve wells by the fourth quarter, which leads to an estimated drilling complete cost of under $10 million for the second half.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and how about in Eagle Ford?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Eagle Ford, we've seen significant cost reductions as we have taken over operatorship of the well. So if you look at the wells currently, we're about $8.9 million on 2012 drilling and completion costs in the Eagle Ford.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Greg, can you give us some idea that how much you are spending your CapEx in Eagle Ford this year, Australia and also Utica, as well as the infrastructure spending in Bakken this year?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I'll pass it on to John Rielly, but the one thing I do want to say, Paul, on the Eagle Ford is relative to our 2011 performance, which was $10.3 million per well, we've already got those cost down to $8.9 million drilling complete in the Eagle Ford and there's more improvement underway as we speak. So that's the average cost. Recent wells have actually been cheaper than that in the Eagle Ford.","John P. Rielly","Paul, if I remember your question, I think you asked for the Eagle Ford, the Utica and Australia...","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And also the infrastructure spending this year in Bakken, the CapEx expectation I should say.","John P. Rielly","Sure. So in the Eagle Ford, and both -- actually, both the Eagle Ford and Utica, there is some land cost as well in these costs. So not just infrastructure and drilling, but Eagle Ford is approximately $380 million this year forecasted, the Utica is about $350 million forecasted of total capital spend. In Australia, the forecast is $220 million for this year. As Greg was saying, finishing up the appraisal program. And as far as the facility costs or the infrastructure costs, all infrastructure cost, not just major, including the gathering systems that Greg spoke about, we're forecasting $760 million of facility cost in the Bakken this year.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And, John, so -- I mean, in theory, that you say the Bakken infrastructure cost will come down after this year. So should we assume, going forward, will be $200 million or $300 million a year?","John P. Rielly","You have to get to ultimately to a recurring number to get to that type of level. So we still do have to finish the Tioga Gas plant as Greg had mentioned in his remarks. So that will still be going on next year. And then it just depends on where the drilling is and getting further gathering systems in pipelines in there, but we will -- we expect the reduction next year in the facilities and then you can see maybe a slow trend depending on the development program that Greg spoke about that we are looking into right now.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And John, wondering that if you can share with us that you're talking about there's a $1 billion to $2 billion of potential asset sales that is currently underway of the negotiation. Let's assume that if those pad [ph] is going to be actually complete, what does the production volume impact may look like?","John B. Hess","Yes, again, Paul, and this question was asked before, we can't give that kind of specific point until the asset sales are finalized and the terms are finalized. So we don't want to be in front of our blockers on this one because some of the deals may not meet our expectations and we'll do some other deals. And until all these deals are finalized, one by one, when they are, we'll give you the details of that. And then obviously, you can update your production accordingly. The key point is the focus going forward is going to be capital efficiency and profitability, and the things we are selling are going to be more mature, not as strategic. We'll still be global independent, but we're going to have a more profitable portfolio and invest in the capital projects that offer the best financial returns.","Operator","At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to management for closing remarks.","John B. Hess","That's it. That's fine. And thank you, all, for your attention. And again, we have our strategy laid out, we're focusing on the capital expenditures. And as we execute our strategy, we're confident that it's going to create a lot of value for our shareholders. We appreciate everybody's interest.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference. That concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"10968":["Hess Corp.

My name is James, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.","Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information which will be provided on our website.","Now, as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will provide a strategy update, Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results.","We continue to make significant progress during the quarter in executing our strategy, to grow our resource base in a capital discipline manner, to move down the cost curve so we are resilient in a low price oil \u2013 low oil price environment and be cash generative at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price post-2020.","Consistent with this strategy, in June, we announced the sale of our joint venture interest in the Utica for a net cash consideration of approximately $400 million as part of our continued efforts to high grade and focus our portfolio by divesting lower return non-core assets. In addition to the $3.4 billion from our 2017 asset sales, these proceeds are being used to invest in our highest return assets, Guyana, which is one of the industry's largest oil discoveries in more than a decade, and the Bakken, our largest operated asset, where we have more than 500,000 net acres in the core of the play, as well as to fund our previously announced $1.5 billion share repurchase program and reduce debt by $500 million.","During the quarter, we announced that we will retain our interest in Denmark where we hold a 61.5% interest in the South Arne field and are the operator. The offers received in a previously announced sale process did not meet our value expectations. Key to our strategy is our position in Guyana; the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator is a massive world-class resource that is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, cost, rapid cash paybacks and superior financial returns.","As such, our first priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit rating in order to fund one of the most attractive oil investment opportunities in the world today. Earlier this week, we increased the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block to more than 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up 25% from the previous estimate of 3.2 million barrels of oil equivalent. The increase follows completion of testing at the Liza-5 appraisal well, discoveries at Ranger and Pacora and the incorporation of results from the recent Longtail discovery into the Turbot area evaluation. The Liza Phase-1 development that was sanctioned last June is progressing rapidly with first production of gross 120,000 barrels of oil per day expected by early 2020. Phase 2 of the Liza development, which is targeted for sanction by the end of this year, will use a second FPSO with gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day, start-up for Phase 2 is expected by mid-2022.","The Liza-5 well was successfully tested the northern portion of the Liza field along with the giant Payara field will support a third phase of development in Guyana. Planning is underway for this third phase, which is targeted to be sanctioned in 2019 and will use an FPSO vessel designed to produce approximately 180,000 barrels of oil per day with first production as early as 2023. The Longtail discovery established the Turbot Longtail area as a potential development hub for recovery of more than 500 million barrels of oil equivalent. Additional prospects to be drilled in this area could increase this estimate. The total discovery discoveries on the Stabroek Block to date have established the potential for up to five FPSOs producing over 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025. There is potential for additional development phases from significant undrilled targets and plans for rapid exploration and appraisal drilling, including at the Ranger discovery. We continue to see multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential on the Stabroek Block.","In April, we extended our acreage position in the prolific Guyana-Suriname Basin by acquiring a 15% participating interest in the Kaieteur Block which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block. The Kaieteur Block is approximately 3.3 million acres or roughly the size of 580 deepwater blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. Also key to our strategy is the Bakken, where we have a premier position and a robust inventory of high return drilling locations. We added a fifth rig in June and plan to add a sixth rig early in the fourth quarter which is expected to generate capital efficient production growth, from an average of 114,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter to 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 along with a meaningful increase in free cash flow generation over this period.","During the quarter, we continued evaluating new completion techniques and initiated a comprehensive study to further maximize the value of this important asset. We plan to provide an update on these initiatives later in the year. Second quarter net production in the Bakken averaged 114,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2018 we continue to forecast that Bakken production will average between 115,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Now, turning to our financial results, in the second quarter of 2018 we posted a net loss of $130 million or $0.48 per share down from a net loss of $449 million or $1.46 per share in the year ago quarter. Compared to 2017, our improved second quarter financial results primarily reflect higher realized crude oil selling prices and lower operating costs and DD&A expense, partially offset by lower production volumes primarily due to asset sales.","Second quarter production was above the high end of our guidance range, averaging 247,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, driven by strong performance across our portfolio. For full-year 2018, we reaffirm our net production guidance of 245,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 255,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. This guidance includes the loss of production from the sale of our Utica joint venture interests and the benefit from the earlier than planned return of production from the Conger field in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico.","In summary we continue to make significant progress in executing our strategy and positioning our company to deliver long (09:09) and superior financial returns to our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update on our operational performance for the quarter as we continue to execute our strategy. In the second quarter, production averaged 240,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. This was above the top end of our guidance range of 235,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day to 245,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and reflected strong performance across our portfolio.","In the Bakken, we delivered another strong quarter despite some despite some curtailments related to heavy rains in June that caused a significant number of road closures. Second quarter Bakken production averaged 114,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the second quarter, we drilled 28 wells and brought 27 wells online. For the full year 2018, we still expect to drill approximately 120 wells and bring 95 wells online. In line with our previous guidance, we have added a fifth rig in the Bakken and plan on adding a sixth rig early in the fourth quarter. We also added a third frac crew early in the third quarter. We continue to see encouraging initial results from our pilot of limited entry plug-and-perf completions. Of the 95 gross operated wells we expect to bring online this year, approximately 25 are planned to be plug-and-perf.","In late June, we announced an agreement to sell our JV interests in the Utica Shale play to Ascent Resources. Production from this asset was expected to average 14,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2018 and we expect this transaction to close by the end of the third quarter. In mid-July, Shell brought its Enchilada facility in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico back online which allowed us to restart production from the Conger field. Production from Conger is in the process of ramping back up to its pre shut-in rate of approximately 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Taking these factors into account, we forecast third quarter production to increase to between 250,000 and 260,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. We are maintaining our full year 2018 production guidance range of 245,000 to 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, as the earlier than expected return to production of the Conger field is expected to offset the production associated with the sale of our Utica joint venture assets.","Both in the third quarter and for the full year 2018, we forecast that Bakken production will average between 115,000 and 120,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. We continue to forecast steady Bakken production growth to approximately 175,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 assuming a six-rig program.","Now turning to the offshore. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production averaged 47,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, in line with guidance and again reflecting approximately 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day of production that was shut in at our Conger field over the quarter. For the third quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 60,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. By the fourth quarter with all Enchilada-impacted fields back online and the continued ramp-up at Stampede, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 65,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Moving to the Gulf of Thailand, production from our Asian assets averaged 63,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter. At the joint development area in which Hess has a 50% interest, production averaged 37,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. Production is forecast to average approximately 36,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2018. At the North Malay Basin, where Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, production averaged 26,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter and is forecast to average approximately 26,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over the year.","Now turning to Guyana. We announced on Monday that gross discoverable recoverable resources at the Stabroek Block, in which Hess holds a 30% interest are now estimated to exceed 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which is up 25% from the previous estimate of more than 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In addition, total discoveries to-date have established the potential for up to five floating production, storage and offloading vessels or FPSOs to produce over 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2025. As we've said before, Guyana continues to get bigger and better.","In late June, the operator ExxonMobil announced an eighth oil discovery at Longtail-1, which is located in the southeast of the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block, approximately 5 miles west of the Turbot-1 discovery. The well was safely drilled to 18,057 feet in 6,365 feet of water in 26 days. It encountered approximately 256 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir. With the success at Longtail, we believe the combined gross recoverable resources in the Turbot Longtail area exceed 500 million barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see several additional prospects in this area that could potentially take this estimate even higher.","Post Longtail, the operator decided to perform routine maintenance on the Stena Carron. This provided an opportunity to complete the riser-less top hole section of Ranger-2 before proceeding to the Hammerhead-1 exploration well in the coming days. Hammerhead is located 9 miles southwest in \u2013 of the Liza discovery. In the coming days, the drillship will move to the Hammerhead-1 exploration well and following completion of the well operations on Hammerhead, the current plan is to return to Ranger.","The Liza Phase 1 development sanctioned in June 2017 continues to make rapid progress. Development drilling began in May, laying the foundation for production start-up in early 2020. Liza Phase 1 will consist of 17 wells and an FPSO designed to produce up to 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Development drilling and construction of the FPSO and subsea equipment is progressing on schedule.","Liza Phase 2 is on track for sanction by year end. The Phase 2 development will utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day with first oil expected by mid-2022. Given the ongoing exploration success on the Stabroek Block and its significant remaining potential, the operator now plans to add a third drillship by the fourth quarter which will be dedicated to exploring and appraising the numerous high value prospects on the block.","On the recently acquired 3.3 million acre Kaieteur Block offshore Guyana in which Hess holds a 15% participating interest, the 2018 work program will include processing and interpretation of 3D seismic data and evaluation of a future drilling program.","In neighboring Suriname, Hess has exposure to an additional 4.4 million acres through our 33% interests in both block 42 and 59. We see these blocks as a potential play extension from the Stabroek Block in Guyana with similar play types and trap styles. The operator Kosmos plans to spud a first exploration well on a prospect called Pontoenoe in Block 42 by the end of the third quarter.","In Canada, offshore Nova Scotia, the operator BP has spud the Aspy playtest well targeting a large subsalt structure analogous to those found in the Gulf of Mexico. BP and Hess each hold a 50% working interest in exploration licenses that cover approximately 3.5 million acres, equivalent to some 600 Deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks. We anticipate results by the end of the third quarter.","In closing, we have once again demonstrated excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. The Bakken is on a strong capital-efficient growth trajectory and this combined with our sizable interest in the world class Guyana Suriname basin has positioned us for more than a decade of visible cash flow and production growth and improving returns and cost metrics.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2018. We incurred a net loss of $130 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared with a net loss of $106 million in the first quarter of 2018. Our adjusted net loss which excludes items effecting comparability of earnings between periods was $56 million in the second quarter of 2018, down from $72 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to exploration and production, on an adjusted basis E&P had net income of $21 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $12 million in the first quarter of 2018. The changes in the after tax components of adjusted E&P results between the second quarter and first quarter of 2018 were as follows: higher realized selling prices increased earnings by $46 million, higher sales volumes increased earnings by $47 million, higher exploration expense reduced earnings by $25 million, higher DD&A expense reduced earnings by $23 million dollars, higher cash costs reduced earnings by $14 million, higher Midstream tariffs reduced earnings by $12 million, all other items reduced earnings by $10 million for an overall increase in second quarter earnings of $9 million.","Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $30 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $28 million in the first quarter of 2018. Midstream EBITDA before the non-controlling interest amounted to $126 million in the second quarter compared to $123 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to corporate, after tax corporate and interest expenses were $191 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $109 million in the first quarter of 2018. After-tax adjusted corporate and interest expenses were $107 million in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $112 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to our financial position. In April, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement which was completed in June, bringing total share repurchases under our previously announced $1.5 billion repurchase program to $1 billion. Total shares purchased to date amount to 19.2 million shares at an average price of $52.18 per share. We plan to purchase the remaining $500 million of shares during the second half of 2018 and are targeting $250 million of purchases in the third quarter and $250 million in the fourth quarter.","In the second quarter, we also purchased approximately $110 million of our public notes, increasing total debt retired to $500 million. Excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion, total liquidity was $6.8 billion including available committed credit facilities and debt was $5.5 billion at June 30. In the third quarter, we completed the purchase of WTI put option contracts that set a floor price of $60 per barrel on a notional 35,000 barrels of oil per day during calendar year 2019. Proceeds from the recently announced sale of our Utica joint venture interests are expected to be received in the third quarter.","Turning to guidance, first for E&P, in the second quarter, our E&P cash costs were $13.37 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $14.03 per barrel of oil equivalent excluding Libya which beat guidance on strong production and lower costs. We project cash costs for E&P operations excluding Libya in the third quarter to be in the range of $13 per barrel of oil equivalent to $14 dollars per barrel of oil equivalent, while full-year 2000 (sic) [2018] cash cost guidance remains unchanged at $13 per barrel of oil equivalent to $14 dollars per barrel of oil equivalent.","DD&A expense in the second quarter was $16.85 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $17.92 per barrel of oil equivalent excluding Libya, which was in line with guidance. DD&A expense excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $18 per barrel of oil equivalent to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent in the third quarter of 2018 and full-year DD&A expense guidance of $18 per barrel of oil equivalent to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent is unchanged. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs excluding Libya of $31 per barrel of oil equivalent to $33 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and for the full-year of 2018.","Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million in the third quarter with full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $190 million to $210 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $165 million for the third quarter with full-year guidance forecast to be in the range of $635 million to $650 million.","The E&P effective tax rate excluding Libya is expected to be an expense in the range of 0% to 4% for the third quarter. The full-year effective tax rate is expected to be a benefit in the range of 16% to 20%, which is updated from the previous guidance of a benefit in the range of 0% to 4%. For the full-year 2018, our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures guidance remains unchanged at $2.1 billion.","Our 2018 crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We have $50 WTI put option contracts on a notion of 115,000 barrels per day of production for the remainder of the year. We expect the non-cash amortization of premiums on our crude oil hedges will reduce our financial results by approximately $50 million per quarter for the remainder of 2018.","For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $30 million in the third quarter with the full year guidance of approximately $115 million, which is above the midpoint of our previous guidance.","Turning to corporate, for the third quarter of 2018, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and the full year guidance is estimated to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million, which is down from the previous guidance in the range of $105 million to $115 million. Interest expenses are estimated to be approximately $85 million for the third quarter and the full year guidance is estimated to be in the range of $340 million to $345 million, which is also down from the previous guidance in the range of $345 million to $355 million.","This concludes my remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi. Your line is now open.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Congratulations John on the continued success in Guyana on that reserve update earlier this week.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Greg. You're welcome. Greg, just some quick questions on the Bakken shale. I know that 40 of the 95 completions this year are supposed to be in the higher productive Keene area. How many of those 40 wells in the Keene area have you done in the first half of the year? And then also of the 25 plug-and-perf wells, how many of those were completed in the first half of the year?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, let me \u2013 thanks, Bob. And before I get started, I do want to correct something in my remarks. Our second quarter production was 247,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, I believe I said 240,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was obviously incorrect.","Let me start with the plug-and-perf wells first. So we expect to do 40 of those this year, drill and complete, but only have 25 of those online. And as you said, we do expect to have 40 Keene wells online, seven of those will be plug-and-perf by the end of the year that will be drilled and completed. Regarding how many we've got done in the first part of the year, I think we have about 12 done in the Keene area in the first half of the year, so the remainder will come in the second half of the year.","Now, what I should say is those Keene wells are doing extremely well, so they're outperforming their type curves at least on the wells that we've done so far by some 25%. So the results here have been very good. Also in the Stony Creek area, the wells that we have done there, again reminding everyone we're going to do 25 of those this year in Stony Creek, those were outperforming their type curves by around 40%. So Stony Creek and Keene are really the top two areas in this year's drilling program and then our East Nesson South and our Capa wells are performing at, about at expectation on the type curve. So Keene and Stony Creek are the ones to watch.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for that update.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, and congrats on the quarter. If we could maybe just hit Guyana a little bit here. So if we look at the guidance of 750,000 or more barrels by 2025, and the expectations of barrels out of the first three FPSOs, we'd be implying kind of Liza-1 sized FPSOs at the minimum in terms of phases 4 and 5, and is that \u2013 should we think of them as upside to maybe where Liza-2 is, when we're trying to frame the overall impact of the development?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Okay, thanks. Thanks for that, Roger. A couple of comments there. I think first of all, in our messaging you note that we said that we see the potential up to five FPSOs to produce over 750,000 barrels a day. So that's one caveat. I think the other one \u2013 the other thing is, is that the ultimate size and timing of those last two vessels very much in the scoping phase, and it's going to be a function of a lot further exploration and appraisal drilling as well as detailed engineering work. And again, these are massive reservoirs with very large areal extent and multiple horizons. So those are directional numbers. Let's get that appraisal and exploration drilling done, and then we can be much more definitive. But again, we see it as over 750,000 barrels a day.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. And one more clarification as we think about Guyana. I know Phase 1 here is an oil only situation, how are we thinking about the gas and the other liquids as you look at these future phases? Any plans to bring the gas to shore or are we thinking pretty much 100% oil in terms of production?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, I think that the grand majority of the gas will be re-injected in the reservoir. There is a small project being discussed with the Government of Guyana to bring a small amount of gas onshore for an onshore power plant. Other than that, all the gas right now is anticipated to be re-injected in the reservoir, because particularly in the Liza complex the gas is miscible. So there will be recovery uplift as a result of putting that gas in the reservoir.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Morning, everybody.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Guys, maybe I could kick off with a follow up on Guyana, just very quickly. I think Roger kind of hit the point about the 752,000 FPSO math doesn't really seem to make any sense, but can you walk us through what the exploration plan is for the second half of the year, it looks like Ranger has obviously been brought forward in the plan. But with a third rig coming in, what should we think about \u2013 what you're trying to identify for the second half and what I'm really trying to get at is, are we getting to a point where we're going to start to see parallel developments on some of these things as you move into that 2023, 2024, 2025 timeline?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Let me answer your second question first, Doug, I think regarding in parallel, we are in absolute agreement and alignment with the operator that the way to approach this development is in a phased manner, so that's currently the thinking right now and we're absolutely in support of that.","Regarding the exploration drilling program for the remainder of the year, all I can say now is that next we go to Hammerhead, we just are in the final phase of drilling the top or drilling the top section on the Ranger-2, we'll go to Hammerhead, then most likely we'll go back to Ranger, the sequence for the fourth rig we're still working out with the operator, but obviously we've got a lot of stuff to do, and we've got a lot of stuff to do in kind of the Turbot Longtail area; there's some things that we'd like to drill there as well, potentially a good resource increase there. So the exact order, we're still working out but there'll be more and more in the Turbot Longtail area.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just to be clear, Greg, is this a third rig or a fourth rig?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","It's a third rig, yeah.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Third rig. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so my follow-up is if I could take you back to the Bakken for a second and I appreciate the color on the Keene and the Stony Creek wells doing better, but can you kind of walk us through, have you completed any plug-and-perf wells yet? Is that contributing to the better performance or is there something else going on with the better performance?","And then your answer, Greg, I wonder if you could take one other comment I think John had made at a prior third-party conference that you're starting to look at potentially putting ESPs down some of these wells as well. So I guess I'm really just trying to get a prognosis for what was embedded in your guidance because clearly the better type curve wasn't embedded in your guidance. So what are you assuming in your guidance and how should we think about the risks for that guide and for well performance as we move into 2019?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, so Doug, the grand majority of our guidance reflects the sliding sleeve wells, and the reason for that is because we only have three of the plug-and-perf wells on right now. Now, they're doing better than expected, but it's early days. So we didn't want to build a whole bunch of uplift in the guidance at this point until we got more data on those plug-and-perf wells. So far so good, but we wanted to have confidence in the data before we did that.","Now on ESPs, we've been evaluating the use of ESPs as well as some other forms of lift. As you know, some operators up there are doing gas lift as well, particularly in the areas that have higher fluid rates and require the use of additional liquids handling. And in particular, the plug-and-perfs, if they continue to perform and have high fluid rates, obviously that's something we're looking at. But at the end of the day, the decision on which forms of artificial lift we're going to use is ultimately going to be driven by economics, not volume. So it will be an economic decision as to what we do on the lift side.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry to press you on this, Greg. Just to be clear, the Keene wells, the Stony Creek wells are doing 25% and 40% better than your type curve, and they're the majority I think of the completions in the second half of the year and that's not in your guidance. So why haven't you raised the guidance in the Bakken?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, we've raised some of the guidance on those Keene wells but only on the sliding sleeve completions, Doug. So I wouldn't \u2013 watch this space, as we get more data, it will reflect itself in the production numbers, but we have not raised guidance on the Bakken until we get more data from the plug-and-perf wells.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah, I think the important thing here, Doug, and obviously you're onto something, which is with the improved completion techniques, we're doing a study to really optimize our investment in the Bakken going forward and we'll be ready to share the results of that study between now and the end of the year where we hopefully can give more specificity and clarity on to what our future production rates might be in the Bakken. So let's get a couple more wells under our belt, and as we do, incorporate that into our investment program, and then the output of that program, obviously focused on returns as Greg was saying, I think we'll be able to provide more clarity on the question you're asking by the end of the year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for your patience, guys. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I had first a follow up on Guyana as it relates to the addition of the third drillship later this year. I was just hoping to better understand the CapEx impact of that. Now, I noticed that overall, CapEx guidance for the year is unchanged, so are there some offsetting efficiencies you're seeing elsewhere in the business that are allowing you to keep CapEx flat with that addition of the drillship?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yes. I mean, if you look where our run rate is right now, so for the first half of the year we came in at $909 million on our capital spend. And the reason is we'd look at that and say why isn't the guidance coming down, but it's because of these type of things that you mention. So, what do we have in the second half of the year? So Guyana, we do have the third drillship, as you mentioned, coming in, it's going to come in the fourth quarter, so that will be an impact. What we also have is a little more Phase 2 spend as we're again coming up on sanction than we had in the first half of the year, so we'll have Phase 1 in Guyana 1 and more Phase 2 spend in the second half of the year.","And then the other component that we have that is going to raise capital in the second half of the year is the Bakken, right? So we have the fifth rig coming in now and the sixth rig coming in later in the year. And yes, so far, our efficiencies have been good with our program. But as we see it right now, we're reaffirming that guidance to $2.1 billion.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. That's helpful color. And then thinking just longer term on the overall cash flow profile of the company, you've talked about being cash flow positive post-2020. And I believe since then there's been upside to the Guyana resource estimate as well as potential for additional phases of development. Can you just talk about the latest thoughts there on cash generation post-2020 and also the ability to fund within cash flow these incremental developments at Guyana longer term?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. The best thing that we can do for our portfolio and matching up with our strategy on generating free cash flow at a $50 environment is to add more oil resources in Guyana. It's just a fantastic asset. Obviously, you've heard all the attributes on it. But combined with the great reservoir characteristic, it just gives superior financial returns and has a very low breakeven price, as we talked about, at $35. So what happens is that you add Phase 4, Phase 5, what we've done for the portfolio is it continues to lower our breakeven price as we go forward and can generate more cash flow in a low price environment or in a higher price environment.","Now, just to get to your specific question on timing on free cash flow, let me tell you what we know right now and as Greg mentioned earlier what we really don't have good information on. So starting with Phase 1, obviously we've got really good information on that, what the capital, what the timing is. Phase 2 feed is progressing rapidly, we expect to sanction that before the end of the year and achieve first oil by mid-2022. So we have good information on that. Phase 3 has now been sized, expected to be sanctioned during 2019, so we have a decent estimate on that. So with those three FPSOs in place, we do see that we can generate free cash flow at $50 post 2020 with those three FPSOs.","Now, Phases 4 and 5 still require, Greg mentioned it, we've got additional exploration appraisal drilling in order to size the projects and optimize the development plans. So at this point, I really do not have a good estimate as to timing how much of that capital could be in 2021 and what exactly the amount will be for future phases. It will be further out in the future. But what we can say about this funding is the way we pre-position the portfolio with our asset sales that the funding is very manageable and that Guyana itself is expected to become free cash flow positive really once Phase 2 starts producing. So that, as I mentioned, will be in 2022. So again, for us, Guyana, it fits right in our strategy, driving our cost down and driving our breakeven for the portfolio so that we can really drive production growth and free cash flow.","Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Arun, if your line is on mute, can you please unmute.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, the first question is for Greg. Greg, as you test the plug-and-perf completions in the Bakken, can you remind us of how you're doing the well spacing within the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks for the plug-and-perf because I believe under sliding sleeve, you're doing eight wells or nine wells in the Middle Bakken per DSU, and maybe seven or eight in the Three Forks. I just wanted to see if you could give us a sense of what the spacing will look like for plug-and-perf?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Again, it's early days. So what we're doing now is we are using the same well spacing that we're using with sliding sleeve because we want to compare the two. So, we want to have a valid comparison by keeping the well spacing the same. Now as we mentioned as part of the Bakken study, we're going to take our data, relevant industry data and one of the outputs of the Bakken study will help us confirm the appropriate well spacing, completion type and proppant loading for each area of the basin. So, that's ultimately what we're trying to determine. And then the penultimate question is, what's the way to maximize value from those DSUs in the Bakken? So that's what we're aiming for with the Bakken study and through our own experimentation.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just can you remind us what the current spacing is under sliding sleeve, just to get the baseline?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. It's on the nine and eight, nine and eight configuration.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Nine and eight, okay. Okay. Great. And Greg, just in terms of the 3Q Bakken guide of 115,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, you did 114,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this quarter with some weather impacts. Do you view that guidance conservative?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, I think we're back on track in the third quarter. So we're right within our guidance range on the third quarter, recovering from the weather impacts that hit us in very late June.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. Got you. And my final question is just on Guyana, you have a gross 4 billion barrel kind of resource range. Can you help us think about potentially now five phases of the project? How much resource do you expect to recover in five of those potential distinct phases?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","I think the recoverable resource on the block again is 4 billion barrels. I think those last two phases as I said before are very much in the scoping phase as to where that \u2013 where those vessels could lie, are they going to be in Ranger or are they going to be in Turbot, kind of complex where are they. So there's still a lot of uncertainty in that. But clearly, we've got a lot of oil to recover here; extremely high value. We're going to do that as judiciously as possible. So this is all good news.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Thanks, everyone. I wanted to ask about the free cash flow inflection, but you've clearly answered that. I guess one follow up would be, given this is so transformative for you in Guyana, the hedging, how do we think about that? And also I guess buyback given that you're currently buying back stock, is that really something that you'll be doing when you have these big asset sales, I assume? And then the final thing again thinking transformatively is dividend policy? Thank you.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. So, let me get the dividend policy and the buyback. So let me just start where we are with that right now. I think as you know, we've got $500 million left under our share repurchase program right now, and we expect to complete that by the end of the year, and we're targeting $250 million in the third and $250 million in the fourth. And so, as we look at it, we've got drilling coming here in the third quarter, we got an exciting well in Suriname, another well as Greg mentioned, Hammer on what our investment plans are going forward. So, it's a little early right now, we'll get to the end of the year, we'll see where prices are and at that point in time, we'll look where we are and see if there's anything from a buyback or debt reduction as we look into the future. Was there, I forgot, Paul, did you have another?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Hedging.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Hedging, sorry.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Yeah. I started with hedging, but you sort of headed towards dividend. Go ahead, sorry.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yes. So from a hedging standpoint as I mentioned we did add 35,000 barrels a day for 2019 and you can expect us to add a bit more for 2019. Why again, it's we're still in the investment phase, Guyana production hasn't started up in 2020. So again from our standpoint, we just think it's prudent to put some insurance on in 2020. Obviously when we get to the free cash flow phases of Guyana then we're in a different position and hedging may be less as we move forward, and that's when we're generating the growth and free cash flow is when we'd start looking at our dividend policy as well and potentially increasing it at that time.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Great. Thank you. And then the follow-up would be, you talk about a $35 breakeven for Guyana, many of us on the call are oil finance nerds. Could you talk about the assumptions that you make to get that breakeven? Thank you.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. It's not \u2013 you don't have to do really that much from an assumption standpoint. So the contract is out there and it's public. It's there. We can't from a confidential standpoint talk about it, but it's public, so you can look at the contract. And the unique difference from a Guyana versus just \u2013 let's just call it a U.S. on a tax and royalty system is the production sharing contract impact. So, even if we're in a great point in the cycle and you have low cost from that, so you can get low F&D in the Gulf of Mexico. But what happens is if prices are lower, then obviously your breakeven is affected because you're not being able to get additional barrels out of the ground.","With a production sharing contract what works with that is your cost recovery gets affected by the price. So, as prices go lower, you get more cost recovery to help with that and that's the way the point of a production sharing contract. So, it's really the mixture of \u2013 the mixture of the reservoirs, how good they are, the low point in the cycle, the F&D costs associated with it and the production sharing contract that gets you to that $35.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","That's great. I appreciate your answers. Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","You've undergone a significant restructuring here in preparation for the Guyana development and production, selling the non-core assets, repurchasing shares. I wonder if you consider yourself towards the final innings of that restructuring with a $0.5 billion of share repurchase left and the Utica assets to close in the third quarter, or do you see any more to come on the asset shifting side of the equation?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. The portfolio reshaping, I'd say the majority of the work's been done. There are one or two assets that still if we got full value for them, we would consider monetizing; if not, we're happy to have them in the portfolio because they're good cash generators. Having said that, I think the key point going forward is as both John and Greg have said; Guyana is really a truly world-class investment opportunity. One of the best if not the best in the industry with low breakeven oil prices and high financial returns across the industry, it's one of the best.","So our first, second and third priority is to fund that, maintain a strong balance sheet, investment grade credit rating to ensure we have the capacity to do that. As we get further definition regarding our future capital requirements for the third phase of development and then potentially a fourth phase and fifth phase as well as the outlook for oil prices, then we're in a better position to give consideration to further returns of capital. But right now, we're focused on execution, finalizing the share repurchase program that we have and bringing more clarity both to our Bakken growth plan and our Guyana growth plan.","So that's where we are, but we love the position we're in. And obviously, I think we're going to be in a position to generate superior financial returns and cash flow generation for many years to come as Guyana comes to fruition and our Bakken plan does as well.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is with regards to that third drillship specifically from an exploration perspective, it sounded like there are some priorities for appraisal at Ranger and elsewhere, but can you speak more to the when and potentially where we would see exploration within the Stabroek Block? And maybe relatedly, can you talk about the extent to which the Ranger and Liza discoveries have de-risked the portion within Stabroek in between the two discoveries, the acreage in between and the plan for exploration there?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. The third ship is going to \u2013 as we understand from the operator now we're working with the operator, going to be focused on bringing further definition to the greater Turbot area with the success that we had at Longtail. To your point, this area is starting to be de-risked, we see some other prolific sand channels there and potential resource adds. So, that's what the third ship is going to try to appraise. The other exploration ship as Greg said goes to Hammerhead first, in the coming days that should be spud, then after that we'll go to further appraised Ranger, maybe one or two wells, we'll see where that goes.","And yes, obviously, as we get definition in each of those campaigns and we get further seismic work correlating the well results with the seismic, we definitely see numerous more prospects on the block. I think Exxon said and we would agree, there are probably another 20 exploration prospects on the block to drill and yes we do see the Stabroek Block being further de-risked as we have more success remember, we're 8 out of 10.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from all Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys. Good morning. A number of questions ...","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","... first is for Rielly. On the hedges for 2019, do you have an estimate what is the amortization cost?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. The cost of the 35,000 barrels a day was approximately $50 million. So, it would be....","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","For the full year?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","... amortized over for the full \u2013 for the full year.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And that's after tax?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yes.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And John when \u2013 previously I thought the 2018 hedges you already closed out or that you already have to offset things so that I thought the amortization charges should be stay constant, why is edging up over the last several quarter? I mean initially you're talking about $30 million a quarter and then $40 million, now they're talking about $45 million. Any particular reason or, now it is $50 million, why there has been hedging up?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. There's two reasons, one that the jump from the $30 million to $45 million was due \u2013 you remember, we did have a collar in place with the $50 WTI options at $65 and we bought back that collar and obviously we're benefiting from the higher prices right now from that purchase. So, that increase from $30 million basically to $45 million. The only difference between the $45 million and $50 million is due to accounting. You have mark-to-market on the way these hedges, you get this ineffectiveness. So we've got this additional amount that sits in other comprehensive income that's going to be amortized for the remaining part of the year, so nothing except accounting associated with that.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. On the Phase 2 Guyana \u2013 on the development, should we assume that the unit cost is going to be about the same as Phase 1 or that because it's a new drillship, so that is going to be higher?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","So we are still, we're progressing feed right now and getting all of that information. So I'd prefer, Paul, we're going to be at the end of the year that we can be a little bit more specific on it. But obviously what I would tell you, this is still going to be a terrific investment there. But right now we're still working with the operator on exactly what the costs will be. We're working through the feed and we'll update you at the end of the year. And...","(56:01)","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","What I will say, Paul, what I will say is that based on what we know so far that the costs are coming in lower on Phase 2 than they did for Phase 1 for most of the service line. So obviously that bodes well for Phase 2.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And Greg, should we assume 220,000, that given that size (56:21), that would be a new drillship, right?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yes, that will be a new build.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Because that Phase 3, on the other hand, will be potentially refurbished. If you only go for 180,000, is that the way how we should look at it?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yet to be determined, but I think it will be no matter what it is, it's going to be consistent with this design one, build many, very efficient kind of strategy where the only thing that flexes is the topsides, those will be modular based on the specific attributes of the development.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And can you give us some rough idea of what's the different cost between the refurbished and a new drillship, is that about $1 billion difference?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Paul, I don't have that information in front of me. What we're doing right now is just working with the operator. Obviously ExxonMobil has been doing a terrific job on that. We could refer that type of question to them, but we'll be again trying to maximize value on this is as we move from Phase 3.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I think the key point here, Paul, is we're finalizing our costs. The operator is doing a great job getting those numbers to be as cost efficient as possible. When we sanction the second FPSO, you'll have the number, and that will be before the end of the year, and then you'll be able to compare as other investors will with our Phase 1 ship as well. So, once we finalize the sanction numbers, we'll give them to you, and then you'll be able to compare that with the first ship that we already have contracted.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And John and Greg, (57:59), now that you no longer put it up for sale, how should we look at that asset, that I think before you put it up for sale, at one point you were thinking about spending some money to gradually expand the production. So, now that you are no longer selling it, should we just assume you're going to maintain it as flat or allow you to decline over time or you're trying to grow it a little bit over time, so how should we think of it?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Paul, South Arne is a very good cash generating asset. Obviously, Brent based pricing generates good cash flows, and it has upside potential both in terms of optimizing the field and further production with some investment, and also some nearby exploration that we could tie in. So, we're coming up with our plans now to have an investment program there. It will have to compete for capital in the rest of the portfolio. But having said that, as we get further definition on what our investment program there, which we think will be very manageable, we'll be happy to communicate that to you. And we're going to retain the asset. We're happy to do it. It's all about value. And in the normal course of business, we'll continue to evaluate options to maximize its value.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. Hey, final one from me is probably for John Rielly, that if we're looking at your 2018 Midstream tariff, say call it $640 million, $650 million, that's roughly about $16 per barrel for the Bakken production. And that must be including some minimum volume. So as we looking out, when you get to 175,000 barrel per day, by 2021, what kind of unit tariff that we should be assuming?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So first, Paul, we do put in the supplement, you can see, how the Midstream tariff then gets calculated in coming back to Hess net barrels, because the first thing, when you calculate it on those numbers, you're getting kind on a tariff applied to a net number, which is really applied to gross volumes and also includes third-party numbers. So if you look at the supplement which we do, we'll put that in place after the call here, you'll see for us it's about $8.70 on a gross basis for our barrels. And then, we have 50% of that. So it's sitting in that kind of $4.00, $4.60 type range net to Hess. Then as we see going forward, when the volumes do increase from the Bakken, you will get \u2013 it is factored in, the growth is factored in the way we calculate the tariffs \u2013 but over time obviously, you'll get the efficiency of scale impact to those tariffs.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Now do you have a number you can share by 2021?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","No. So, I mean, again, we've talked about the Bakken study, what we're doing now, that all has to be integrated into our infrastructure plans and that will work into the tariffs. So that's all part of the Bakken study to maximize value.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advocators (sic) [Advisors]. Your line is now open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Yeah, no problem. So, most of mine have been answered at this point. I'm just curious, on the Bakken, earlier in the year you had talked about a 4Q rate of around 120 to 125 mboe a day. Is that still in the cards? Is that something we should still be modeling towards? It sounded like maybe sub 120 per the comments, but I didn't know if that was just kind of rounding, for a lack of a better word?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","So I just want to make sure what you're asking, Michael. So on the Bakken volumes that we're talking about as we were getting to the end of the year?","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah, I think it was about two calls ago or something, you talked about 120 to 125. Is that still fair?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, you can still expect us to be at 120,000 barrels plus in the fourth quarter...","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","...in the Bakken. In fact if you just look at our guidance and the way we have the 115,000 to 120,000 barrels in the third and then going 115,000 to 120,000 barrels for the full year, you'll see we are still planning to be above 120,000 barrels.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Got it. Yeah, I didn't know if that comment on the full year meant the rest of the year or \u2013 sorry, I was just trying to clarify.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, no.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","That's helpful. Okay. And then the remaining wells to be turned online in the Williston this year, are those relatively evenly loaded across the year or is there any emphasis in 3Q or 4Q just from a timing standpoint?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","More of them will be in the fourth quarter because what happens now is we get the fifth rig coming in, really any wells that are drilled by the fifth rig, that won't impact the third quarter. That's why we'll get more wells online in the fourth quarter and the production going up from there.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yeah. The fourth quarter is going to be a very big quarter in terms of wells online.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then the last one, I guess, just on the Williston again and can you just quantify how much the weather impacted 2Q in June?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","It was a couple thousand because we were, as Greg said, we were right on track April, May, it was June and the weather \u2013 and that month was affected. So overall for the quarter it was a couple thousand barrels. And right now we are right back on track where we were before.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Great. That's it. Thanks very much.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Your line is now open.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hey guys, thanks. Greg, just to follow up on the prior questions about Keene, as we look out to 2019 with the rig count entering the year at six versus four in the first half of this year, from a directional standpoint should we expect activity will be less focused on the Keene area with the mix maybe dropping down to closer to a third of completions versus close to half this year, or would you expect to keep the Keene mix closer to 50%?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. I think the Keene percentage will go down, but obviously in our 2019 budget we'll update the guidance because we will be most likely in a 100% plug-and-perf mode by then. So all the IP180s and everything will have to be updated as we do our planning guidance for 2019.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","But, yes, there will be fewer Keene wells next year than this year.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. And can you quantify...","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","But that doesn't mean IP180s average for the year will be less. With plug-and-perf, there would be upward pressure on IP180s in a plug-and-perf situation. But we'll update all that when we give guidance next year.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. And you've quantified how many remaining locations there are at Keene or is that something that will come out after the study?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","That's something that will come out after the study as well.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just a question maybe for John Rielly. You guys have reported working capital cash outflows for the past six quarters that have amounted to roughly $1 billion or so. What have been the primary factors there? And when would you expect that trend to sort of reverse?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. So first of all, we did have the hedging, right? So we'd kind of gone through with our hedges. Now we will have, as I mentioned earlier, we have $50 million on our 35,000 barrels a day in 2019. So that will come in the third quarter. So our hedging do go through there. Some of the things that were basically impacting us besides the hedges of premiums paid is we do have \u2013 you've got your normal things like pension contributions, you've got \u2013 we had abandonment. If you're going back several quarters in when we had Valhall, those were always significant amounts. We've got timing on income tax payments related to Libya, in the 93.5% tax rate. So those will always continue. And what I would say is on a normal run rate basis, our first quarter and our third quarter were going to be the higher pulls on working capital. So you have \u2013 because one, we \u2013 that's the semi-annual payments on our bonds happen in the first and third quarter. The first quarter always has your bonus payments in there as well.","And then, outside of that, it's just normal recurring. So the only unusual things that we'll get in there is kind of from the hedging and things like that. So if you looked at this quarter, right, it wasn't much of a pull in cash flow and you can see it was an add in fixed assets. So we actually, on an overall basis, working capital had a positive on the bottom line from it. So things are going to move in and out just like that and first and third being bigger and second and the fourth not so much.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. I wanted to just ask Greg to kind of step back and give me an overview of all this plug-and-perf stuff. In the past, I thought you had said that you felt these were going to be best for maybe Tier 2 type resource, but it sounds like that it's, particularly based on what you just said about 2019, it sounds like this is moving towards becoming a primary way to complete the wells, so maybe I was confused. But, could you just talk about it kind of on a higher level?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. You bet. So I think you are correct. We always knew that as we went outside the core of the core that we would have to use plug-and-perf, so I think we've always said that. But what we are doing is part of the Bakken study, because some of our competitors are using plug-and-perf in the core of the core. We're trialing some of that as well. So again, our mission here is for the two-thirds of the inventory remaining in the Bakken, what is the best way to maximize value per DSU both in the core and outside the core. So we wanted to get some wells in the core as well to do a good comparison. So that's the ultimate, ultimate objective of the Bakken study.","Now based on the results, so far, and again it's a limited sample but based on the results so far indicatively it looks like that even plug-and-perf in the core can give you an improvement. So, but, at the end of the day we're going to go area by area in the field and answer that question, what's the best way to maximize value per DSU. And that answer could vary depending on where you are on the field and the completion design could vary dependent on where you are in the field. Right now directionally we're just saying plug-and-perf looks pretty good, so from an assumption standpoint let's assume that we're going to do plug-and-perf throughout the field.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Well that's helpful and also I assume as you always say that case-by-case it's going to be economics, so if \u2013 if it were somehow possible that sliding sleeve would produce a better economic in....","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","....some place then you would use that.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Exactly. And I think what's happened with plug-and-perf, so there's been quite a change in plug-and-perf over the last couple of years which kind of changes how we think about it and that's the introduction and perfection of limited entry perforating. So, that allows you to tightly control where your proppant and fluids are going. And then secondly the cost of plug-and-perf have come down substantially during the downturn. So, that made plug-and-perf come more into queue on a comparison basis to sliding sleeve. And then finally we reached kind of the technical limit on sliding sleeve is about 60 stages is all you can really stuff in those. So, I can get more stages, have tight control and is a cost that's not that far off of plug-and-perf, or sliding sleeve. So, therefore it makes sense to evaluate that technology now.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","That was really helpful. I appreciate it. And I just wanted to ask quickly, you mentioned you're going to go to six Bakken rigs by the end of the year, and I think you said you've already added a third frac crew. I was just wondering, is this the activity level that you see maintaining going forward or are you still unsure until you complete the development study?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, I think directionally it looks like six rigs is about right, and that's a function of -- you don't want to build infrastructure too fast and overbuild and not be capital efficient. So six rigs at this point is still kind of the sweet spot. The third frac rig -- frac crew will be added in the latter part of the year. So we have not added that yet, but it's on its way.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks for clarifying that. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just one question for me, kind of a high level point about Guyana. Given the new targets you're putting out for 2025, at least a third, possibly half of the company's net volumes will be coming from Guyana at that point. How comfortable are you just kind of conceptually with that level of asset concentration, and to state the obvious, what's historically been somewhat of a frontier market?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","We're very happy to have one of the truly world-class investment opportunities in the oil industry that keeps getting bigger and better. We believe that our 30% working interest is appropriate for this world-class asset. We have a world-class operator in ExxonMobil, and so we're happy to have this opportunity to invest shareholder money which has a very high financial return.","So net-net we are happy with it and you got to remember, it's part of our portfolio, we also have the Bakken, we also have the Deepwater Gulf and also Malaysia. So the combination of that portfolio I think manages and is really managing not only the risk of the different investments but the financial performance of those. So we think our focused portfolio with that balance and that's the key makes Guyana standout and be positioned the best way that it can be for our shareholders.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, clear enough, appreciate it.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Nicole and I'll I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay Wilson","Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John Hess","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I\u2019ll review highlights from 2016 and plans for 2017. Greg Hill, will then discuss our operating performance and John Rielly, will review our financial results. First, I would like to share our view of the oil market, particularly in light of the recent OPEC agreement. We are entering a new chapter in oil prices.","After two years of a lower for longer price environment global investment in exploration and production has been severely curtailed, nearly in half from approximately $700 billion in 2014 to $380 billion last year. While 2017 should see modestly higher investment than 2016, we believe this level of spend will not be enough to bring forward the necessary production over the next several years to meet future oil demand growth and offset production declines globally.","We see continued strong demand coupled with the anticipated reduced supply resulting from OPEC and non-OPEC supply cuts and natural field declines, more than offsetting increased U.S. shale oil production, leading to higher oil prices this year and into 2018. Our company is extremely well positioned for this improving price environment. We have a decade or more of visible reserve and production growth and our continued focus on operational excellence and financial discipline is driving improving returns and lower costs across our portfolio.","Our visible growth trajectory is underpinned by four key areas; the Bakken, where we have a leadership position and we\u2019ll go from two rigs to six rigs over the course of 2017. Two offshore developments North Malay Basin and Stampede, which are expected to contribute significant production and cash flow when they come online in 2017 and 2018 respectively. And the world-class Liza and recent Payara oil discoveries in Guyana. With sanction of the first phase of the Liza development expected mid-year and continuing appraisal and development activities underway.","In 2017, we will continue to be disciplined in investing in our growth projects, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. On January 12, we announced 2017 capital and exploratory budget of $2.25 billion. About 70% of our 2017 budget is allocated to our four major growth areas. With activity increasing in 2017, our focus will be on execution. In terms of safety, cost control, project delivery and working with our partners to advance our discoveries in Guyana to development.","Now turning to our 2016 financial results, our adjusted net loss was $1.5 billion and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $840 million. Compared to 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas sales volumes and selling prices, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower operating costs and DD&A expense.","From an operational standpoint, while we reduced activity across our producing portfolio in 2016, our team has much to be proud of. Driving operational efficiencies across our portfolio, delivering reductions in capital expenditures and cash operating cost, progressing our offshore developments and achieving major success with our focused exploration program.","In 2016, full year net production was 321,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. In 2017, our production is forecast to average between 300,000 and 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. It is important to note that first quarter 2017 production is expected to increase in excess of 10% from first quarter levels.","Driven by the startup of North Malay Basin in the third quarter, increased activity levels in the Bakken and the restart of drilling at the Valhall Field in Norway, all of which builds momentum and positions the company for strong production growth in 2018.","At year-end 2016, our proved reserves stood at 1.1billion barrels of oil equivalent and our reserve life was 9.2 years. We were placed 119% of production in 2016 and an SG&A cost of approximately $13 per barrel of oil equivalent.","Now turning to the Bakken, Hess has one of the highest quality acreage positions in the play, with more future drilling locations in the quarter than any other operator and an advantage infrastructure position. Through our application of lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team has achieved among the lowest drilling and completion costs and most productive wells in the basin, offering very attractive financial returns.","Bakken production in 2016 averaged 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting our reduced drilling program. Bakken production in 2017 is forecast to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With the increased activity in the Bakken and the improvement in the MLP market, Hess infrastructure partners is preparing for an initial public offering LP common units in 2017.","Turning to our offshore developments, Full-field development of North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand is on track to achieve first production in the third quarter of 2017. The Stampede development in the deep water Gulf of Mexico is progressing and remains on schedule for first oil in 2018. Together they\u2019re expected to add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in transition from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company.","With regard to Guyana, we are excited about the significant resource potential on the 6.6 million acres Stabroek Block. The Liza-3 well result last October, confirmed Liza as one of the industry\u2019s largest oil discoveries in the last 10 years, with estimated recoverable resources of more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017, with production expected in 2020.","This month Payara-1 well confirmed a second significant oil discovery with the same high quality reservoir. Payara and an additional deeper reservoir identified directly below the Liza field are accretive to the estimated recoverable resources already confirmed at Liza and further demonstrate the prospectivity of the Stabroek Block.","The Stabroek Block offers very attractive economics and will be very material for our company. The Liza and Payara oil discoveries underpin a large discovered resource on the block that has significant upside in terms of appraisal and future exploration potential. The reservoir quality is world-class with high-porosity and permeability. The wells can be drilled in a third to a half of the time and cost of those in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and we are entering the development phase at what will likely be the bottom of the offshore cost cycle.","In summary, we are well positioned to deliver visible and sustainable growth and value to our shareholders. We are increasing activity in the Bakken, which will bring growth back into our onshore portfolio and support a potential IPO of the midstream business to unlock additional value. Offshore, our developments in the Gulf of Thailand and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico are poised to add significant volumes and become long-term cash generators.","And in Guyana, the Liza field is one of the industry\u2019s largest oil discoveries of the last ten years, which we and our partners will continue to appraise and progress toward development. Overall, we see 2017 as the start of an exciting new chapter of value driven growth and increasing production momentum for our company and our shareholders.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory Hill","Thanks John. I\u2019d like to provide an operational update for 2016 and review our plans for 2017. Clearly the past year was challenging in terms of oil prices and we responded by reducing our capital spend and operating cost.","Last year was also marked by strong execution on many fronts including the continued advancement of our North Malay Basin and Stampede developments and exceptional exploration results in Guyana, firmly establishing a new world-class oil province.","With regard to production, in 2016 we averaged 321,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. In the fourth quarter, production averaged 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, which was above our guidance of 305,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","During the quarter, production from Libya resumed and on a net basis averaged 4,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Production from Libya remains highly uncertain therefore we\u2019ll continue to exclude it from our guidance.","As John mentioned, in 2016 we achieved a reserve replacement ratio of 119% and SG&A cost of $13 per barrel of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions totaled 143 million barrels of oil equivalent. About half of the additions were in the Bakken, reflecting higher EURs associated with their shift to 50-stage completions and lower cost. Other areas with additions include North Malay Basin, South Arne and the Utica.","In 2017, we forecast companywide production to average between 300,000 to 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our production has been decreasing over the last several quarters as a result of reducing our capital expenditures to manage in the lower price environment. Our production will continue to decline in the first half of 2017 as a result of this reduced spend and a high level of planned maintenance at four of our offshore assets in the second quarter.","We forecast production to average between 290,000 and 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter and between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. Production is in forecast to increase in the third quarter with the start-up of North Malay Basin to between 305,000 and 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Production will continue to grow in the fourth quarter as Bakken production increases as a result of the rig ramp up and the first new Valhall well comes online. Fourth quarter production is forecast to average between 330,000 to 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, resulting in production growth in excess of 10% or some 40,000 barrels per day from the first to the fourth quarter of 2017.","Turning to operations, the Bakken continues to deliver outstanding results. We continue to improve our drilling and completion performance with fourth quarter D&C cost dropping 10% versus the year ago quarter to $4.6 million. We now have enough production history to conclude that we will get an average 13% uplift in EUR per well from our 50-stage completions compared to our previous estimate of 7%.As a result, we\u2019ve increased our estimate of ultimate recovery from our Bakken acreage to 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent from our previous estimate of 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent.","In the fourth quarter, initial production rates for wells that reached IP30 during the quarter averaged a record 1,091barrels of oil per day versus 843 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter. This result reflects all wells during the quarter being 50-stage completions and in the core of the core of our acreage.","Going forward we will shift our guidance to IP90 rates which we feel are more reflective of a well\u2019s actual performance. In 2017, we forecast IP90s to average between 700 and 750 barrels of oil per day compared to 620 barrels of oil per day in 2016.","Net production from the Bakken averaged 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016, which was at the top end of our beginning of the year guidance range of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below guidance due to extreme winter weather which resulted in road closures and an unusually high number of shutting facilities and wells.","The net negative impact of weather in the fourth quarter on the Bakken was about 7000 barrels of oil per day. With the recovery in oil prices to the mid-50s, we plan to increase our rig count from the two rigs we currently have operating to six rigs by the end of this year and expect our rig count to average approximately 3.5 for the year.","In 2017, we plan to drill approximately 80 wells and bring approximately 75 new wells online over the year. We will continue to focus our drilling in the core of our Bakken acreage where our sliding sleeve completions, site spacing and higher stage counts deliver optimal value. Of the 75 wells we plan to bring on line this year, approximately 50 wells will be our new standard 50-stage design and we expect the D&C cost for these wells to be in line with the 4.8 million that we averaged in 2016.","We will also be conducting two new completion design pilots this year in our drive to continually optimize the value of our industry-leading acreage position. The first pilot will be increasing the stage count to 60 from the standard 50-stage design. We plan to test this in 10 wells to ensure the reliability of the system and our forecasting well costs in these 10 wells to range between $5 million and $5.5 million.","The second pilot will involve higher proppant loading. The 60-stage sliding sleeve may be approaching the technical limit and mechanical design. Therefore, we now want to test the technical limit on proppant loading in a sliding sleeve well. We plan to increase proppant loading in 15, 50-stage wells and forecast these wells to cost in the range of $5.5 million to $6 million dollars.","For both of these trials, reservoir stimulation indicates a potential IP180 uplift of 10% to 15%. If successful, our future development plans and production outlook for the Bakken will be modified accordingly in 2018. The extreme winter weather conditions have persisted throughout the month of January and as a result we forecast production in the first quarter of 2017 to average between 90,000 and 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","For the full-year of 2017, we forecast our Bakken production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With the building rig count, we expect our Bakken production to average between 105,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the fourth quarter of 2017, which would represent a growth rate of approximately 15% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of 2017.","Moving to the Utica, in 2016 net production averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As a result of continued wide basin differentials, we intend to maintain our drilling pause in the Utica.","In 2017, production is forecast to average between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. However, given the high quality of our Utica acreage position, our high average net revenue interest of 95%, as well as the first quarter well performance that we delivered in 2016, the asset will be an excellent resource to develop as natural gas and NGL price realizations improve.","Now turning to the offshore, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in both the fourth quarter and for the full-year 2016. We forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017 and to reach approximately 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2017.","This production growth reflects the addition of a new well and the restart of an existing well following a work over at the Tubular Bells field in the first quarter. A restart of a well at the Conger field also following a work over and a planned new well at the Penn State field, which will come online in the second half of this year.","In Norway, at the Aker BP-operated Valhall field in which Hess has 64% interest, production averaged 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. The transition from BP to Aker BP-operatorship was completed in the fourth quarter and we're looking forward to working together with the new operator to maximize the value of the Valhall asset. Drilling from existing platform rig is planned to resume in March. In 2017, net production is expected to average between 25,000 and 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","At the South Arne field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, net production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. The field is expected to average approximately 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017. In the fourth quarter, the Danish government awarded an extension of the South Arne license through to 2047. This secures the long-term future of this asset and provides for future phases of development.","In Equatorial Guinea where Hess is operator with an 85% interest, net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016, reflecting the drilling pause in place since mid-2015. Net production in 2017 is forecast to average approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Interpretation of the latest 40 survey has been completed and has identified multiple new targets. However, the production outlook for 2017 reflects continuation of the drilling pause over the year.","At the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. Net production averaged 34,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and is expected to average approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017. No further drilling activity will be required to meet contracted volumes for the year as a result of the booster compression project that was completed in the third quarter of 2016.","Moving now to our development projects, at North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, three remote wellhead platforms were hooked up and commissioned in the fourth quarter. The drilling campaign is on schedule with two wells being drilled in the fourth quarter bringing the total number of wells drilled so far to 13. All wells have either met or exceeded pre-drill expectations.","The last heavy lift for the central processing platform topsides is completed and sail away is scheduled for the first quarter of 2017. Net production through the early production system averaged approximately 26 million cubic feet per day over 2016. Once full field development is completed in the third quarter of this year, we forecast net production to increase to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day and to remain at this rate for many years, becoming a significant cash generator for the company.","At the Stampede development in the Gulf of Mexico in which Hess as a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully completed installation of subsea equipment at both drill centers and completed all topsides heavy lift on to the hall. Looking forward, in 2017 we will install the TLP and topsides on location, complete the subsea installation, and continue our drilling program. First oil remains on target for 2018.","Turning to Guyana, exploration and appraisal drilling activity continues at the 6.6 million acres Stabroek block in which Hess holds a 30% interest. As announced earlier this month, the Payara-1 well located approximately 10 miles northwest of Liza discovery, was drilled by the operator Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited to a depth of 18,080 feet and encountered more than 95 feet of high quality multi-Darcy permeability, oil bearing sandstone reservoirs.","Two sidetracks were subsequently drilled to take core and further evaluate the reservoir. Both sidetracks found high quality oil bearing sands. The original well and the two sidetracks were drilled, logged and cored in 56 days. A production test is now planned to further evaluate the reservoir. Appraisal drilling is planned later this year to help define the full resource potential of the Payara discovery.","After completing the well test on Payara-1, the rig will move to drill the Snoek exploration prospect, which is located approximately six miles south of the Liza-1 discovery well. The next well in queue is Liza-4 appraisal well, which will pass the eastern part at Liza field. This will be followed by a Payara-2 appraisal well.","Earlier this month, we announced that the Liza-3 appraisal well, which reached target depth in the fourth quarter, identified an additional high quality deeper reservoir directly below the Liza field, which is estimated to contain recoverable reserves between 100 million and 150 million barrels of oil equivalent. This additional resource is expected to be developed in conjunction with the Liza discovery.","The operator plans to continue to appraise the Liza and Payara discoveries are in parallel continuing to evaluate the wider resource potential of the Stabroek block for additional exploration drilling and seismic analysis over 2017. In closing, in 2016 we once again demonstrated strong execution performance and took proactive steps to manage through the weak oil price environment by significantly reducing our capital span and operating costs while continuing to progress our future growth options.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John Rielly","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2016. The corporation incurred a net loss of $4.892 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $339 million in the third quarter. The largest driver for the loss in the fourth quarter was a non-cash accounting charge of $3.75 billion on net deferred tax assets in the U.S. Denmark and Malaysia.","This non-cash adjustment is required under accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. The deferred tax charge has no cash flow or economic impact. The company's underlying tax position remains unchanged. Beginning in 2017, our financial results will not recognize a deferred tax benefit or expense in these three countries until the deferred tax assets are reestablished.","Our guidance for 2017 includes the anticipated impact of this charge, which will result in a lower effective tax rate going forward. Fourth quarter results also included an after-tax charge of $693 million to fully impair the carrying value of our natural gas project offshore the North West Shelf of Australia as a result of our decision to defer further development, so we can allocate capital to other projects that generate higher returns including the Bakken and Guyana.","Other after-tax charges totaling $145 million were recognized for exit costs for an offshore drilling rig, loss on debt extinguishment, impairment of older specification rail cars, severance and surplus materials and supplies inventory. Excluding items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods, our adjusted net loss was $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with an adjusted net loss of $340 million in the third quarter.","Turning E&P on an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $257 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to a net loss of $285 million in the third quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the fourth quarter and the third quarter of 2016 were as follows.","Higher realized selling prices improved results by $37 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $23 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $29 million. All other items reduced results by $15 million for an overall decrease in fourth quarter net loss of $28 million. In the fourth quarter, our E&P operations were over lifted compared with production by approximately 300,000 barrels, which did not have a material impact on fourth quarter results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 43% in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with a benefit of 41% in the third quarter.","Turning to midstream, the Bakken midstream segment had net income of $3 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $13 million in the third quarter. Higher revenues in the fourth quarter reflect a recognition of deferred minimum volume deficiency payments that were partly offset by lower throughput volumes caused by severe weather in North Dakota.","Fourth quarter results also include a pre-tax charge of $67 million or $21 million after taxes and the 50% non-controlling interest to impair older specification railcars. EBITDA for the Bakken midstream before the non-controlling interest, amounted to $99 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $73 million in the third quarter.","Starting January 1st, 2017, our midstream segment now includes the company's interest in the Permian gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets and our North Dakota water handling assets, which principally consists of gathering infrastructure. These assets are wholly-owned by the company and are not included in our Hess Infrastructure Partners joint venture.","Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $68 million in the third quarter.","Turning to cash flow for the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $128 million. The net increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $198 million. Additions to property, plant, and equipment were $487 million. Net repayments of debt were $592 million. Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $90 million. All other items resulted in an increasing cash of $46 million resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $797 million.","Fourth quarter cash flow from operations before changes in working capital of $128 million reflects a reduction of approximately $200 million associated with the charges for rig exit costs, severance, and surplus inventory and higher well work over costs in the quarter.","Turning to cash and liquidity, excluding the Bakken midstream, we ended 2016 with cash and cash equivalent of $2.7 billion, total liquidity of $7.3 billion, including available committed credit facilities and total debt of $6.73 billion.","Turning to guidance, first with E&P, we project cash costs for E&P operations to be in the range of $16 to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2017, and $15 to $16 per barrel for the full year of 2017 as compared to 2016 cash costs of $15.87 per barrel. Full-year cash costs per barrel are lower than the first quarter, reflecting the startup of North Malay Basin project in the third quarter and increasing production from the Bakken in the second half of 2017.","DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2017 is forecast to be $25.50 to $26.50 and $24 to $25 for the full year of 2017, down from 2016 DD&A of $26.57 per barrel. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs of $41.50 to $43.50 per barrel in the first quarter of 2017, and $39 to $41 per barrel for the full year of 2017, down from 2016 E&P unit operating costs of $42.44 per barrel.","Exploration expenses, excluding dry holes, are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million in the first quarter of 2017, and 250 million to 270 million for the full year of 2017, similar to 2016 exploration expenses of $261 million, excluding dry hole expense. The Midstream tariff, which now includes tariffs associated with our Permian gas plant and related CO2 assets and additional North Dakota water handling assets, is expected to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $520 million to $550 million for the full year of 2017.","The EMP effective tax rate excluding Libya is expected to be a benefit in the range of 11% to 15% for the first quarter and 17% to 21% for the full year 2017 versus a benefit of 42% in 2016. As mentioned we will not be recognizing deferred taxes in the U.S., Denmark and Malaysia which causes the lower effective tax rate. This lower effective tax rate will have no effect on cash flow.","Turning to Midstream, in 2017, we anticipate net income attributable to HESS from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million in the first quarter and in the range of $70 million to $90 million for the full year.","Turning to corporate, in 2017 our corporate and interest expenses will not receive deferred tax benefits as discussed and therefore our guidance reflects pre-tax numbers due to the absence of a tax provision.","In 2017, we estimate corporate expenses to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million in the first quarter and in the range of $140 million to $150 million for the full year. We estimate interest expense to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million in the first quarter of 2017 and in the range of $295 million to $305 million for the full year of 2017.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah, good morning. First question just relates to better understanding, the CapEx and the completion activity in the Bakken and just trying to think about 2018. I know you spent 429 million in the Bakken and did 100 wells [ph] and I know you had some ducts that helped you little bit. In 2017, you are guiding to $700 million in CapEx, at the completion count is going down like 25, just wondering if you could maybe help me reconcile that and could reflect some higher infrastructure spending but just thinking about the completion versus the CapEx in 2017 and tops around completion activities as we think about 18.","John Hess","Yeah, so let me just kind of breakdown the - there is a total of about $660 million being spent in the Bakken next year. About $50 million of that is for non-operative participations in some wells that we are expecting this year. So that leaves about $610 million for I will call it Bakken operated and if you look at that $610 million and break it down, the bulk is drilling in completion. So about $465 million is for drilling and completion at all the related facilities associated with that. There is about $95 million also in that category but that is money spend in 2017 for future years, so that\u2019s the ducts that get carried into 2018 and also the pads that we'll construct in 2017 or early 2018. And then there is about $50 million left for major maintenance and some field upgrades more statistical that we put in the budget. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful.","Arun Jayaram","That\u2019s very helpful. And just my follow up question is, if you could just maybe better help us understand some of the first half \u201817 maintenance related shutdowns that you forecast. I think you all added [ph] four projects that will experience some down time, can you give us some more color on that, pretty much appreciated.","John Hess","Yeah you bet, I mean most of that - almost all had downtimes in the second quarter and about 13,000 barrels a day down first quarter versus second quarter or second quarter versus first quarter associated with those major shutdowns offshore. About 5,000 of asset Llano [ph] in the Gulf, about 6000 is Equatorial Guinea and couple of thousand barrels a day at Conger also in the Gulf of Mexico. So that\u2019s a majority of it.","Arun Jayaram","Okay thanks a lot, appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Greg the update in the Gulf of Mexico, I am just wondering if we could take a little bit in moving part this year, you mentioned but what is the current status and expectations for Tubular Bells trajectory in the full year?","Gregory Hill","Doug, it is just too early to say on Tubular Bells and that\u2019s because we are basically increasing the chokes and not only that the well that was worked over and they came on in December 31, but also the new well they came on late December as well, so we are just in the early stages of ramping Tubular Bells back up I want to get it stable, we are also getting wider injection stables, I really want to see kind of the well results from that before I be specific on that, so potentially maybe we could provide an update once we get stable.","Doug Leggate","So what are you assuming in your full year guidance for Tubular Bells.","Gregory Hill","We aren\u2019t going to give that and again Doug, I am not trying to be evasive, I just really want to see these wells ramp up and see what they are at.","Doug Leggate","My second one, hopefully a quick one is and I have got one more on Guinea, if I may, just assuming oil prices coming trajectory through the year gives a little higher, what is the first call in cash for HESS in 2017?","Gregory Hill","So if oil prices come in higher you know what we are doing with the rig ramp in Bakken, we have always said that first call in cash will be the Bakken. So we will continue to look and accelerate how we will bring the rigs in and so that\u2019s what we would be thinking about at this point. So the first call would go to the Bakken.","Doug Leggate","Okay, thank my final one - I am going to try this, I am not sure I am going to get a lot of mileage out of you guys on Guinea, but I will give it a go. So on the last call, John Hess, you suggested we would know the upper end of Liza, I realize that the Exxon guidance is above a billion but upper end would be 1.4 plus the 100 to 150 I guess gets you to 1.5. But my question is Greg suggested that you are going to drill eastern flank of the field. So can you tell us what proportion of Liza structure is derisked to get the 1.5 to get some ideas to what proportion the overall field capacity will ultimately look like? I'll leave it there thank you.","John Hess","Very fair question Doug, as we pointed out after the Liza 3 well, we confirmed and partners did as well that we were in excess of a billion barrels of oil I think it is very important to note when asked Liza deep will be accretive to the number, Payara will be accretive to the number. [indiscernible] and potentially Liza 4 will be accretive to the number, so to give specificity at this point in time would just be too early. We got to finish the appraisal that we are underway but there is upside to the numbers that we gave guidance on last quarter.","Doug Leggate","So and just a quick follow on, are we going to get a second rig down here given the potential move to FID?","Gregory Hill","That\u2019s under discussion with the operator Doug, obviously after we take out FID, we want third drilling development wells at some point.","Doug Leggate","All right, thanks everybody.","Gregory Hill","Okay thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","John Hess","Good Morning.","Brian Singer","Can you talk to your cost inflation assumptions that are built into your capital budget guidance and what if anything you are seeing now, I thought I heard you mention that you are going to be able to keep Bakken cost, Bakken well cost flat in 2017 and if I have heard that right, but can you talk to what risks that you could see as the year progresses and mitigation on that.","John Hess","Yeah, I think in 2017, we anticipate seeing some pressure in the onshore, commodity based chemicals and potentially as well. But we are pretty confident, you are exactly right, we are pretty confident that we can hold our well cost flat in the Bakken on 50 stage completion in the core at kind of that at $4.8 million average number that we had in 2016. The way we are going to offset increases I mean in sand, commodity base, chemicals, those kind of things is basically by continuing to apply our lean manufacturing capability which we have consistently as you know have been able to pull a $100,000 to $200,000 a quarter out of the well cost. And there is still a bit more room left for that improvement as well.","Brian Singer","Got it, thanks. And then separately as your completions in the Bakken are evolving, can you talk to how significant you see further technological improvement in the Bakken or whether you think we\u2019re in the latter innings and does the success in improving EUR solidifies the Bakken as your key shale horse for the company or rather give you more confidence to look at other areas.","Gregory Hill","Well, let me talk about the completions in the Bakken first, as we said in our opening remark, we are doing a couple of pilots this year. And so in the core of the core which is where we have been focused, where we have that very tight, nine in eight spacing we demonstrated that the best way to optimize value in that core of the core is by using Sliding Sleeve Technology and then steadily increasing the stage counts, which effectively kind of increases the pro-well proppant loading that gives you a nice uniform frac all the way down the well bore and as you know we have worked with our supplier to continue to engineer more and more sliding sleeves in the 10,000 foot lateral. Now we believe that we could be approaching a technical limit on the number of sleeves somewhere between 60 and 70. That\u2019s just given the tight tolerance as between all the ball sizes. So given that we may be approaching that maximum stage count with a sliding sleeve system, we now want to push the technical limits on the per stage proppant loading.","So given our tight nine in eight spacing which is only about 500 feet between the wells, we are going to pilot those higher loading to find out where the optimum point might be to further increase value while not causing significant well to well interference. So when we know what is with the proppant loading that we have, we haven\u2019t seen any significant well to well interference so that says you can probably get more proppant in the well and still be okay. So we are going to test the limits of that this year and see exactly how much that is. And so certainly on the sliding sleeve system, in terms of your question on where we are on technology, I think again as we approach 70 stages and got a lot number I think we are start to reach the technical limit there and next things will be proppant loading for us in the core of the core. But again that sliding sleeve system because it is so inexpensive and so efficient to install it is the highest optimum completion technique in the core of the core.","As you move outside the core which we will being testing that an in the later years 2018, 2019, data seems to indicate that maybe slickwater completions or even higher proppant loadings with plug and perf maybe the answer out there and that\u2019s purely because there is a lot natural fracturing when you get out of core of the cores. So you are going to need more sand and more energy in the reservoir to connect all those fracture to that. So that\u2019s kind of where I see it going.","John Hess","And Brian your question about our position in the Bakken and how we feel about it and potentially, expanding our shale footprint in the US. In terms of the Bakken obviously improvements Greg and his team have made in the lean manufacturing, improving productivity, advancing application and technology, obviously everything governed my lean. We are very pleased with the investment opportunity; we have there, the increasing ultimate resource count that we have that reflects the increasing IPs. In terms of expanding our shale footprint, we are always looking to optimize the value of our portfolio in the normal course of business, however given our robust portfolio of captured growth opportunities with excellent return, starting with the Bakken, but also the low-risk high return inflow opportunities that we have in our offshore hubs and now Guinea outright acquisitions are low on our priority business. ","Brian Singer","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Ed Westlake","Hey, good morning. And I am sure we are not going to up in this year all the results, but as you told F&D cost analyze I mean are you able to share like total development cost for the field?","John Hess","No Ed, we'll share that when we take FID and so we'll give - during sanction [ph] you'll get a lot more color on cost and volume and production rates and all that. That will most likely be around midyear as when we take FID on Liza Phase 1.","Ed Westlake","Could we get recovery per well or that will be at the same time, just as we try and model ahead of the announcement.","John Hess","Yeah, we will give you as much disclosure as we can at sanction.","Ed Westlake","Okay and then on Payara, I mean obviously sort of a narrow net pay I mean is if that does perhaps suggest a small recovery and perhaps more expensive development and I mean anything in that well to suggest that\u2019s the wrong approach EG, like pressure regime, did you test deeper zones there as well, maybe some color on how Payara stacks up against Liza on a per unit basis?","John Hess","No, I think a couple points. You bet, yeah it is early days I think let me be clear. Payara is separate and distinct from Liza. So it is ten miles away and having said that the reservoir quality was outstanding, [indiscernible] permeability and same kind of porosity that we saw in Liza. So we are very pleased with the initial results on Payara but we are going to have to do further appraisal to determine the ultimate size of the Payara discovery, the area will extend.","Ed Westlake","And then maybe switching gears, I mean you signaled acceleration production growth into 2018. I appreciate there is a lot of variables but I don\u2019t know if this point you can share a range particularly I see Bakken will move up, but if well does recover this in a room to perhaps even increase recoveries of Valhall, [indiscernible] all of these decisions just to get - give us a sense as to what the past into \u201818 looks like.","John Hess","Yeah, so I think the only thing we can say with certainty at this point is you know the Bakken will - we are investing a lot in 2017 in the Bakken. You begin to really see production increase in 2018 in the Bakken. Obviously the second major catalyst in 2018 is Stampede. Beyond that we really can't be specific on an activities there because as we said it is going to depend upon oil price, I think the other thing it will happen in 2018 is as you'll have a four year North Malay Basin because of course you\u2019re only getting a partial year this year. So there is a lot of production catalyst upsides in 2018 and you begin to see that in the back half of this year. Our low point as we said is the second quarter but then by in the third and the fourth quarter you really start to ramp and as I said in my opening remark, if you look at the first quarter versus the last quarter, the delta on production if you just take the midpoint, the range is above 40,000 barrels a day. So we really start to surge in the last half of the year.","Ed Westlake","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber of Simmons. Your line is now open.","Guy Baber","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your reserve report which I thought was pretty impressive but reserves in F&D obviously can be lumpy but the $13 barrel F&D you highlight was a pretty solid result. So the question is do you think that is the type of F&D cost that's representative for your company through cycle. Or where there is some reserve lumpiness that may have contributed to that and then more broadly just wanted to get thoughts about how you are thinking of the evolution of your F&D for the total company over the next few years and what do you think as sustainable level?","John Rielly","Sure, I mean like you said, this will be qualitative because you know the reserve at F&D can be lumpy. For the most part let me just tell you what drove our reserve and the very good FD&A that we reported. So half of it is as Greg mentioned earlier it is really driven in the Bakken and it is moving up to those 50 stage fracs. We are getting higher EURs and there and over time as we continue to move up to potentially 60 stages and things like that. F&D in the Bakken is going to be an increasingly accretive if you want to say to our past F&D numbers. So that investment we'll be investing in lower cost reserves.","So that\u2019s one, let me go longer terms, so we don\u2019t have the numbers yet right as Greg just mentioned and we get the FID in Guinea. But we clearly see for all the reasons that John Hess mentioned and Greg mentioned in the opening scripts that the positive attributes that you see in Guinea, low well cost, their recoverabilities, the high quality reservoirs that we see the F&D is definitely going to be accretive again post our past F&D cost. So our continued investment in Guinea and now that\u2019s going to be lumpy when you get the reserves in, but that's going to be very positive to our F&D reporting going forward. Then within the year itself that you would see North Malay Basin, we picked up some additional reserves, but that's just increased drilling and as we spend money there, the only one that you could see that was kind of, if you want to call lumpy or not tied to CapEx as much with South Arne, we did have a license extension in South Arne, so that was extended out to 2047 and we picked up about 20 million barrels there in South Arne. The rest of it was just from our normal portfolio adds in the positive things that we're doing in E&P.","Guy Baber","That\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow-up is, I just want to better understand the flexibility embedded in your plans to ramp from two to six rigs in the Bakken. So, can you talk about the variables that might have you ramping up faster than that or slower than once you've indicated? Are there price-related trigger points you can share with us or any other issues you're monitoring around people, equipment? And if you could just help us with a framework for how you're thinking about managing that pace I think would be helpful.","John Hess","Yeah, so I think for the first half of the year we'll be adding kind of a rig a quarter and then for the back half of the year, the rigs will probably come in the fourth quarter and that just has to do with the scheduling of the wells, getting the pads ready, all of that sort of thing. Now, there is potential to accelerate those rigs. Maybe another rig comes in the third quarter rather than two in the fourth quarter. We're looking at all of that. But for us, the limiting factor for us is we want to bring these wells on safely. And the cadence for us seems to be that we can bring a rig on about one a quarter and confidently say that we can do that safely and efficiently. So, those are our two drivers, safety and efficiency in terms of how fast we can ramp those rigs.","Guy Baber","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Doug Terreson","Good morning, everybody.","John Hess","Good morning.","Doug Terreson","First, let's hope that John, the oil price or outlook ends up proving correct, because I think it will all be better off in that scenario. So, just to clarify, first of all, on the Bakken comments, what was the point that despite all the commentary that's in the market about personnel, equipment availability, et cetera, you believe that your drilling time and cost per well are going to be pretty close to flat year-over-year in \u201817 that as long as you're drilling in the core, was that pretty much the message on that?","John Hess","Yeah, it was, Doug. And as we've spoken about before, during the downturn we tried to preserve a lot of capability in the Bakken, particularly on the contracting side, so that we can enable a smoother transition as you ramp back up. So, we're reasonably confident that in 2017 we can manage that very efficiently, which is why we set our 50-stage fracs in the core. We believe we can hold the costs at that kind of $4.8 million number that we achieved in 2016.","Doug Terreson","Okay, perfect. And then strategically, in the United States and also overseas in E&P business, when you consider reversion to the mean that we've seen on returns for the big oils and declining [indiscernible] returns on E&P, it seems like competitive conditions are pretty intense out there and then we've also had a fairly staggering rise in energy private equity funding over the past couple of years, which doesn't help that much either.","So, while you guys were early in refocusing the company on advantaged areas, done a really good job there. My question is that when you think about the future, what are the strategic imperatives for companies like Hess such that you can continue to navigate this competitive condition successfully in the future? I mean, what would you have to do to ensure the shareholders are rewarded, given this changed condition? Or do you think that the threats not so significant that it requires a response?","John Hess","No, I think you're absolutely right. It's a competitive world out there for oil resources and obviously the two years of a \u2018lower for longer\u2019 price environment has challenged for everyone. Having said that, we think our company is extremely well positioned. And what's going to guide us, Doug, is value, allocating capital, the highest returns and we continue to look at shale opportunities in the United States. You're right to point out that that's a very crowded market and big question mark on returns going forward because of some of the prices being paid.","Where we're actually seeing better opportunities to invest our capital is in the offshore that is much less competitive and we're getting very, very attractive opportunities that will fit our cash flow profile but also give us opportunities to make significant value for our shareholders going forward. So, obviously led by Guyana but the opportunities we have in the Guyana\u2019s basin, I think, has legs. There are some other offshore opportunities we see there. So, we're going to be driven by value and in the long run we believe that strategy is the one that will reward our shareholders the most.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Good answer, John. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys, good morning. The first one is for John Rielly. John, you mentioned that you're not going to have any recognize, any deferred tax in U.S., Denmark, and Norway. Is that purely just a function of price? And at what point that you - those areas that you have the price is high enough and you start making money? So, we assume that you start recognizing the deferred tax benefit in the cash flow or that is going to be a while?","John Rielly","Okay. I just want to clarify. So, it's U.S., Denmark, and Malaysia.","Paul Cheng","Malaysia.","John Rielly","Yes, those are the three areas. And so, as a result, again this is just a bookkeeping requirement that is in the accounting rules because of this three-year cumulative loss that we have or any company would have, you would have to take down your net deferred tax assets. When we try to or have losses going forward, we can't book deferred tax benefits in those three countries until we reestablish the deferred tax assets. So, your question is when is that going to happen and that is not exactly also in the rules. So, it's going to kind of be a facts and circumstances analysis at a time.","So, first of all, we will be emerging and starting to show profits, but then you have to see just like your point, what are the market conditions at that time and any other relevant evidence at that point. So, usually putting a deferred tax asset back on your books is going to require a little bit more positive evidence including now that you're out of this three-year cumulative loss position. So, again I just want to make sure everybody does understand there is no effect on cash flow. There is no economic impact to this at all, so from this charge or the lower effective tax rate going forward.","Paul Cheng","The second question is for Greg. Greg, just when I\u2019m looking back, when North Malay, the early production systems there, I think the expectation is that [indiscernible] 40 million cubic feet per day until the full development on it and your ramp to 165. Obviously, last year that declined below 40. So, the lower production, is it - what then really is causing you? Is it equipment issue? Is it a reservoir issue or is it contract issue, demand issue, can you just - in other words, I mean, what confident that we have once the full production that you really indeed will be able to [indiscernible] in 165?","Gregory Hill","Yeah, so, Paul, the early production system, the reason the production is down slightly this year is because of well. So, we lost the well and that early production system is going to go, remember that, that goes away. So, it doesn't make any sense to re-drill a well for a very short lifespan. So, I have all the confidence in the world that the 165 is a good number. We've got a great well stock. We've drilled 13 wells already. All of those wells have come in at or better than pre-drill expectations. So, the wells are healthy. We've got a great wealth stock. We've got a large number of wells in North Malay Basin or will have, so I have a lot of confidence in the 165 number.","Paul Cheng","Greg, the 165 is based on how many well producing at the same time and what is the average well production?","Gregory Hill","I can give you more color on that as we get closer to actually bringing it on, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Okay.","Gregory Hill","If you ask me that in mid-year and I can give you some more color.","Paul Cheng","Okay. For the Stampede we've been talking for some time, the 2018 start up and that we're now getting closer. Is there any maybe an EBIT more granularity in terms of is it going to be first quarter, second quarter, mid-year, second half, any kind of addition of data?","Gregory Hill","No, we'll give you guidance on that later in the year as we get closer. So, we still have - remember what we're trying to do this year, we're going to float out the TLP and topsides, get those landed on location. We got to get all the subsea umbilicals and flow lines done and then we'll also continue drilling. So, 2018 is a big year of installation. So, we'll give you more color as those activities progress throughout the year.","Paul Cheng","And in Valhall under the new operator, how many wells that they are going to drill this year?","John Hess","Yeah, there will be three wells that actually get drilled. Only one will come on this year. So, the other two will come on next year.","Paul Cheng","So, we should not expect that Valhall production will be up until fourth quarter?","John Hess","Yeah, I think that's a good - I think that's a good estimate, so kind of flattish. In the meantime, we do have a shutdown in Valhall associated with that Ekofisk in the third quarter, but that's fairly minor in the big scheme of things. So, again, we guided 25 to 30 for Valhall this year, which is relatively flat where it was last year.","Paul Cheng","Oh, I see. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Paul Sankey","Hi, good morning everyone. Just a high level question, John, you started out with the [indiscernible]. Greg, you talked about more efficiency. I was wondering, what was the balance between the decisions to accelerate the Bakken in terms of an expectation of higher oil prices or whether it's all about the fact that you can do more for less? Thanks.","John Hess","It's actually both at the end of the day. We said as prices approach 60 and really have a firm five in the price and we feel pretty good about that. We would be comfortable starting to accelerate our Bakken program and obviously with a great work that Greg and his team have done about lowering costs, increasing stage counts, increasing productivity. When you add it all up, it's about allocating capital the highest returns and we saw some very good returns there.","Paul Sankey","Yeah I think that you\u2019ve led into the second thoughts on which was, I think previously you talked about free cash flow generation of 60 in the Bakken if I'm not wrong and that being the number at which you would accelerate, are you effectively saying that that number is now lower?","John Hess","Well, actually, so our plans, our capital plans - fair question. Our capital plans for the Bakken anticipate that asset generating free cash and growing as well and obviously that free cash is going to be a function of what the oil prices, but our plans aren't just to invest all the cash to grow production. It's also to make sure that we start getting some cash back from that asset and that's an integral part of how we thought about allocating the capital.","Paul Sankey","Okay. Thank you. And then one to add to the Guyana question, just wondering you said Payara very similar to Liza, but one can thus note explicitly net pay seems a lot less. Is there anything to say about that? Thank you.","John Hess","I think the key thing there is we just have more appraisal to do, but we think it will be a significant resource in and of itself, how big it is, more appraisals necessary.","Paul Sankey","I guess the question was I think you had 95 feet of net pay at Payara, which is less than half of the Liza?","John Hess","Absolutely, but more appraisals necessary to find out what the resource size is going to be and so, let's wait for that appraisal before we can be more definitive about what the number is, but we do think Payara itself will be significant.","Paul Sankey","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ryan Todd","Yeah, thanks. Maybe as we just look over the medium term in terms of managing and kind of cash inflows and outflows, you have a large cash balance on hand right now. As you look towards - but a decent sized outspend likely in 2017 as well, so as you look forward over the next few years, how do you anticipate drawing down that cash balance versus the preference towards kind of achieving cash flow neutrality?","Gregory Hill","Sure. So, again the key is, as we've been talking about, we've been spending this capital on these development projects, North Malay Basin and Stampede and we're getting obviously closer to getting them both online and generating free cash. So, if you are looking from like a general guidance of where we are this year, if you were excluding basically North Malay Basin and Stampede\u2019s capital, our operating cash flow would cover CapEx and dividends in 2017 kind of at the current strip prices that we have.","So, it's - and then going forward, it's like John just said, I mean obviously prices are going to play an important role in this, but we're trying to balance our investment in growth and this generation in free cash flow and we've always said 2018 will be the big transition year for us. Now we're generating free cash flow from this North Malay Basin in Stampede and we can use that cash flow now to begin to generate into our development projects, say, in Liza and other growth projects like in Bakken. So, we will balance that continually going forward.","Ryan Todd","Okay. And any consideration I know it was asked earlier about your appetite for just additional acquisitions. I mean as you look about at the extent of your global portfolio on the flip side, do you look at - how do you - how is the appetite for additional monetization of resource across the portfolio either from some of your global assets or even a farm-down of Guyana in terms of either allowing you to fund future developments or accelerate capital deployment in places like the Bakken?","John Hess","Yeah, now fair enough portfolio optimization, as I said before, is something we look at every day and is in the normal course of business. So we're always looking to optimize that and go where the value is and go where the returns are. Having said that, outright acquisitions are low on the priority list because what we have captured in our portfolio both short cycle and long cycle already offers very attractive returns to our shareholders.","And in terms of Guyana, it offers such attractive returns that that is not looking at something that we would sell down. But as I said in our overall portfolio we're always looking to optimize and as opportunities present themselves we\u2019ll consider them.","Ryan Todd","Great and maybe one quick follow-up on the Bakken, fourth quarter, as you mentioned in your comments and as we see in the data, in the fourth quarter you saw significant increase in well productivity at least in terms of 30-day IPs versus prior quarters. Can you talk a little bit about what the mix shift was in terms of 50-stage fracs 3Q versus 4Q? And is that a number what we saw in 4Q that we should view as kind of a more representative number of the drilling program going forward in terms of well productivity?","Gregory Hill","Yeah, I think in the fourth quarter, you're right. All the wells that we drilled are 50-stage and that was truly in the core of the core. So, the best wells that we've drilled in the Bakken that 1091 barrels of oil, kind of IP30, those were the wells we were drilling in the fourth quarter. We will stay in the core in 2017 that will be the bulk of where our drilling is. Certainly, on average because of the 50-stage fracs, the IP90s and the IP30 rates will be higher in 2017 than they were in 2016. So, the whole inventory is not going to be the 1091 kind of IP30s. That was truly some extraordinary wells. So, it'll still be - the average is going to be higher this year than it was last year. So, good upside there.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now open.","David Heikkinen","Good morning guys and congratulations on the ramp going into fourth quarter. One thing with all the moving parts of Valhall and Malay that is gas but oil linked, can you just give a BO expectation, just barrels of oil for the fourth quarter in that split for the overall corporate guidance?","Gregory Hill","David, make sure I understand your question.","David Heikkinen","You gave BOEs, what\u2019s just the barrels of oil in the fourth quarter?","John Hess","Barrels of oil for the fourth quarter of 2016?","David Heikkinen","Yeah, in that 330 to 340 guidance, what would be the split?","John Hess","Oh, now I understand, now I understand in the fourth quarter number. So, we would be moving up considerably here. I'd say it's going to go up approximately almost close to 14%, I'd say, between the first quarter and the fourth quarter on the oil. So, you're going to see that jump clearly above in the range of 210,000 barrels a day plus in the fourth quarter for the oil in that number.","David Heikkinen","That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Touhy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning. I was just wondering if you can share any early impressions of [indiscernible] that takes over the operation at Valhall, I mean I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rude to say that sometimes we felt like the prior operators left something to be desired, so I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re feeling about them in your early impressions?","Gregory Hill","Yeah, thanks for the question. I think John and I have met with their senior management twice over the course of the year as recently as a month ago and we\u2019re encouraged by their approach and we really look forward to working together with them to maximize value from the Valhall asset. Hess did a lot with BP and I\u2019ll credit BP with their progress that they\u2019ve made in the last couple of years using many of the techniques that we develop on South Arne, applying those to Valhall both lean manufacturing and some shaft drilling and well [indiscernible] techniques that we developed in the North Sea. Acre, BP is carrying on with that and we\u2019re excited that they can even drive more improvement beyond what BP was able to achieve with our help in the last couple of years.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. I think we\u2019ll look forward to that. I just wanted to ask one quick question with regard to Guyana. It sounds like the Liza-1, the Liza-3 and Payara, all tested different formations. I was just wondering with the next well that\u2019s coming and the visible explorations that you see, are you going to be just essentially testing one of those once again in a different location or are you going to be testing an entirely new formation?","Gregory Hill","Now, these are all upper cretaceous, so every one of these wells has been upper cretaceous. So all of the well test, everything that we\u2019re doing is all confined to the upper cretaceous. Even the Liza deep is upper cretaceous accumulation.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, thank you, I appreciate.","Gregory Hill","Do you mind, I just want to clarify something for the group that I gave because that was - you were specifically asking before oil. I had some liquids numbers in there, so again from an oil and liquid standpoint there will be a significant increase as you go into fourth quarter. Oil again will have a significant increase, but oil will be about 190,000 barrels a day plus in the fourth quarter and then liquids will be above that. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. Thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"10523":["Hess (NYSE:HES) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 24, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Jay R. Wilson - Vice President of Investor Relations","John B.

My name is Matthew, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","With me today are John Hess, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President, Worldwide Exploration and Production; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which Greg Hill will provide an operational date and John Rielly will review our financial results.","As most of you are aware, our management team and Board of Directors have been in the process of undertaking a multiyear transformation of Hess Corporation into a more focused, higher-growth, lower-risk pure-play E&P company. We are successfully executing our plan and are gratified by the results of our first quarter adjusted earnings of $669 million, which, from last year's first quarter of $509 million, represents an increase of 31%.","We achieved these results even after the loss of production from the sale of our interest in the Beryl, Schiehallion and Bittern Fields in the United Kingdom North Sea, as well as the downtime associated with the Valhall redevelopment project in Norway. This accomplishment, in the context of our continuing transformation, bears testimony to the focus, commitment and hard work of our dedicated team of senior managers and employees.","While we will get into the financial details behind these results later, I would like to spend the next few minutes reviewing the progress we have made toward becoming a pure-play E&P company. On March 4 of this year, we announced the final steps of the strategy, with 3 overarching goals: one, that we continue to reshape our upstream portfolio and exit our remaining downstream operations; two, that the proceeds from these divestitures be allocated both to fund the company's future growth and provide substantial current returns to shareholders; and three, that Hess deliver on its forecast of 5% to 8% compound average annual growth in production.","In just the 7 weeks since this announcement, we have made substantial additional progress toward achieving these goals. Let me start with an update on our divestitures. Both the Azerbaijan and Beryl asset sales were closed in the first quarter, yielding after-tax proceeds of $880 million and $440 million, respectively. We agreed to the sale of our acreage in the Eagle Ford shale play in Texas for $265 million, relieving our company of approximately $500 million of capital expenditures over the next several years.","On April 1, we announced an agreement to sell 100% of Samara-Nafta in Russia to LUKOIL for $2.05 billion. Hess has a 90% ownership position in Samara-Nafta. Last week, LUKOIL received the consent of the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service to acquire the asset. We expect to close this transaction within the next week.","Work is also underway on the divestment of our upstream assets in both Indonesia and Thailand, as well as the processes to exit our downstream terminals, retail, energy marketing and trading businesses. We will apply the proceeds from our recent divestitures, including Russia, to reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet so the company will have the financial flexibility both to fund its future growth and also to direct most of the proceeds from additional asset sales to return capital directly to shareholders. We expect the $4 billion share repurchase plan to begin in the second half of this year. In addition, we will increase our annual dividend to $1 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2013.","Lastly, we are continuing to make excellent progress toward delivering our production growth forecast of 5% to 8% per year compounded annually. To that end, net production from the Bakken Shale oil play in North Dakota, our principal engine of growth, averaged 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, an increase of 55% over the year ago quarter. We continue to forecast Bakken production this year to average between 64,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Our average well cost from drilling the Bakken in the first quarter was $8.6 million, a decline of 36% from the first quarter last year and a continuation of a steady downward trend since the beginning of 2012. We believe our operating performance in the Bakken ranks among the best.","In the emerging Utica Shale play, we continue to execute our appraisal program and remain encouraged by the results. In addition, the Valhall Field redevelopment is complete, and our focus is on the drilling campaign to increase production. We also continue to advance our development projects at Tubular Bells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, and we will submit our appraisal plan for offshore Ghana to the government in the second quarter. Greg will further elaborate on our operating results in a moment.","As you can see from this brief overview, we are making substantial progress toward our goal of becoming a pure-play E&P company. However, there is still much to do. With the commitment of our people and their focus, we are confident that we will continue to successfully execute our program and deliver value to our shareholders.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Greg Hill, who will bring you up to date on some of the operational details behind these results.","Gregory P. Hill","Thanks, John. First, I'd like to comment on the recent changes to our portfolio announced on March 4. And then I'd like to provide an update of our progress in executing against our three-pronged growth strategy of unconventionals, exploitation and focused exploration.","As John mentioned, we've taken numerous actions this quarter to ensure our portfolio is focused on higher-growth, lower-risk assets. During the first quarter, we announced that we had reached agreements to sell our interest in several noncore assets, including ACG, Beryl and the Eagle Ford, and began the process to divest our assets in Indonesia and Thailand.","On April 1, just after quarter end, we also announced an agreement to sell Samara-Nafta in Russia. We expect to close the Samara-Nafta transaction in the second quarter for net proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion, generating an after-tax gain on sale of approximately $900 million. The ACG and Beryl transactions resulted in gains of $360 million and $323 million, respectively.","While we incurred an after-tax loss in the fourth quarter of 2012 of $192 million related to the sale of our Eagle Ford position, we were not able to establish a core acreage position there, and we'll now be able to reallocate approximately $500 million in future capital expenditures to higher-return opportunities in our portfolio. Following these divestitures, roughly 80% of our remaining reserves in production will be confined to 5 principal geographical areas. These 5 areas can be described as long-lived, good-margin areas with low-risk growth that leverage our capabilities and competitive advantage.","The opportunities within these 5 areas reflect our three-pronged strategy for future growth through: one, unconventionals, with growth driven primarily from the Bakken and Utica; two, exploitation, with growth driven by Tubular Bells, Valhall and North Malay Basin; and three, focused exploration in areas such as Ghana. This balanced strategy underpins our forecast of 5% to 8% compound average annual growth in production.","Now let me turn to our progress in executing against each leg of this growth strategy, starting with the first element of our strategy, unconventionals. We continue to make excellent progress towards our mid-decade goal of achieving net production of 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Bakken. First quarter net production was 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 55% from the first quarter of 2012 and in line with our previous guidance for 2013.","As a result of our transition to pad drilling, as previously discussed, production will be relatively flat through May as we continue to build the inventory of drilled but not completed wells. Production will increase substantially in the second half of 2013 as we ramp up our completion activity. We remain confident in our 2013 Bakken production forecast of between 64,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In terms of individual Bakken well performance, we are focused on driving high returns, which, as you know, is a function of both well cost and well productivity. Well cost for the first quarter averaged $8.6 million per well, down 36% from $13.4 million per well in the first quarter of 2012 and down from $9 million per well in the fourth quarter of 2013. The continued quarter-and-quarter in cost has been driven by our application of Lean manufacturing techniques. Our productivity continues to be the highest in industry, as 10 of the top 25 wells in the North Dakota Bakken play in 2012 were Hess wells. Therefore, considering well cost and productivity coupled with higher margins from our infrastructure, we believe we're one of the most competitive Bakken operators, and there is much more optimization to come.","During the quarter, we brought 30 wells on to production, of which 21 were Middle Bakken and 9 were Three Forks. For the full year, we expect to bring approximately 175 wells on to production with 2\/3 targeting the Middle Bakken and 1\/3 targeting the Three Forks.","Our Tioga rail facility ran at capacity in the first quarter, delivering an average of 53,000 barrels per day to higher-value markets. Our Tioga Gas Plant expansion project is on schedule to be commissioned at the end of 2013, which will enable us to capture more value from our own gas and third-party volumes.","In summary, our long-lived, high-margin Bakken asset continues to deliver relatively low-risk growth that leverages our capability and competitive advantage. Operational performance is firmly on track as our team continues to focus on execution, capital efficiency and profitable production growth.","Turning to the Utica. The appraisal of our acreage continues, and we are increasingly encouraged by our well results to date. In the first quarter, 4 wells were drilled, 7 were completed and 5 were flow tested. 3 of the 5 tested wells were operated by Hess. On our 100% owned acreage, we tested 2 wells during the quarter. Capstone 2H9 well in Belmont County tested at a rate of 2,242 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 42% liquids; and the NAC 4H-20 well in Jefferson County tested at a rate of 7.5 million cubic feet per day of dry gas. On our joint venture acreage, we tested the Jeffco 1H-6 well in Harrison County at a rate of 1,432 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 20% liquids. Also, as previously announced, the Athens 1H-24 well, also in Harrison County, was tested in late 2012 with a rate of 4,230 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 59% liquids. Although still very early days in the appraisal phase, these well results are encouraging. In 2013, we and our partner, CONSOL, plan to drill approximately 30 wells across both our 100% owned and joint venture acreage.","Turning to the second element of our strategy, exploitation. Progress continues at Tubular Bells, Valhall and North Malay Basin. At our 57% owned and operated Tubular Bells development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our first production well was drilled during the first quarter and encountered 146 feet of net pay, which is 46% higher than predrill prognosis. We are currently drilling the second production well, and facilities construction is on schedule for field startup in mid-2014 to deliver 25,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day of high-margin production.","At the BP-operated Valhall Field in Norway, in which Hess has a 64% interest, field redevelopment project completed, and the operator resumed production on January 26. In the first quarter of 2013, net production was 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as the operator began to ramp up facilities and resolve routine start-up issues. Full year 2013 net production from Valhall was forecast by the operator to be in the range of 24,000 to 28,000 barrels of oil per day, which we believe will come in at the lower end of this range. Looking forward, our primary focus is to work with the operator to grow production over the coming years, leveraging the chalk reservoir drilling and completion capability we have developed in South Arne in Denmark. Two drilling rigs are working in the field currently, with the goal of bringing 6 new wells online during 2013.","In Southeast Asia, we continue to demonstrate our project execution capability. In the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area, we installed our eighth wellhead platform in the first quarter on time and on budget. At North Malay Basin, we installed a jacket and topsides for the early production system in April and plan to start development drilling at midyear. The project is on track to commence first gas in the fourth quarter of 2013 at a net rate of approximately 40 million cubic feet per day. We also continue to advance full field development scheduled for first gas in 2016, which will increase net production to approximately 125 million cubic feet per day.","Turning to the final element of our strategy, focused exploration. We announced in February our seventh consecutive discovery in Ghana, Pecan North-1. Drilling performance in Ghana has been top quartile with cost for the last 3 wells, which were drilled in 6,000 to 8,500 feet of water, averaging $40 million per well. Discussions regarding the appraisal plans for the block are ongoing with the Ghanaian government.","In closing, we are on plan with respect to both our strategic positioning and operating performance. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thanks, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2012.","But before I begin, I want to highlight some changes we have made in our first quarter earnings release and supplemental data. As a result of the corporation's previously announced plans to divest its downstream businesses and complete its transformation into a pure-play Exploration and Production company, we have presented the after-tax downstream results for all periods as discontinued operations. With this change, we now operate with 2 segments: an Exploration and Production segment and a Corporate and Other segment, which is primarily comprised of corporate and interest expenses.","As a pure-play E&P company, we have made various changes to the financial and operating data in the earnings release. For example, in the income statement, our previously reported production expenses have been split into 2 lines: operating costs and expenses; and production and severance taxes. In the operating data, we provided quarterly sales volumes in addition to a more detailed breakout of production volumes.","Finally, as we have done in the past, we have filed our supplemental earnings presentation on our website. We have added quarterly operational data for the Bakken and pro forma E&P results for 2012 and 2013 to the supplemental presentation. The pro forma information presents our results as if our asset divestiture program had all been completed effective January 1, 2012, so that we can present a historical comparison of the performance for the remaining portfolio.","Turning to consolidated results. The Corporation generated consolidated net income of $1,276,000,000 in the first quarter of 2013 compared with $374 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. As a result of progress in our transformation, there are a number of special items in the quarter. Excluding the items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the corporation had earnings of $669 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared with $409 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to Exploration and Production. E&P had income of $1,286,000,000 in the first quarter of 2013 and $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, E&P had income of $698 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $431 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. First quarter results included after-tax gains totaling $683 million related to the sales of our interest in the Beryl and ACG fields. First quarter results also included an after-tax charge of $67 million for employee severance costs and a noncash income tax charge of $28 million as a result of a planned divestiture.","Fourth quarter 2012 results included net after-tax charges of $106 million from items affecting comparability of earnings between periods. Excluding these items, the changes in after-tax components of the results were as follows: higher realized selling prices increased earnings by $148 million; lower exploration expenses improved earnings by $94 million; lower operating cost increased income by $57 million; the mix of sales volumes decreased earnings by $17 million; all other items net to a decrease in earnings of $15 million, for an overall increase in first quarter adjusted earnings of $267 million.","Our E&P crude oil operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 300,000 barrels in the quarter, which increased after-tax income by approximately $10 million. Our E&P cash operating costs were $21.20 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2013, and our guidance range for the full year remains $21 to $22 per barrel.","Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses were $19.28 per barrel for the quarter, and our guidance range remains $19 to $20 per barrel for the full year. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was 42% for the first quarter of 2013, which was below our guidance due to the start-up of production from the Valhall Field. The full year E&P effective income tax rate is still expected to be in the range of 46% to 50%.","We have Brent crude oil hedges covering 90,000 barrels of oil per day at a price of approximately $109.70 per barrel that are in place for the remainder of 2013.","Turning to Corporate and Other. Corporate expenses were $44 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared with $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Corporate expenses in the first quarter of 2013 included an after-tax charge of $11 million for employee severance costs. After-tax interest expense was $66 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared with $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Turning to Marketing and Refining, which are now classified as discontinued operations. Marketing and Refining earnings were $100 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $159 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. As a result of ceasing refining operations at the Port Reading facility in February, first quarter 2013 results included after-tax income of $137 million relating to the liquidation of LIFO inventories, partially offset by after-tax charges totaling $64 million comprised of accelerated depreciation and other shutdown costs. In addition, an after-tax charge of $43 million was recorded for employee severance costs related to our plan to exit the corporation's downstream businesses. Fourth quarter 2012 results included net after-tax income of $71 million from items affecting comparability of earnings between periods.","Turning to our financial position. We are applying the proceeds from our asset sales program in order to have the financial flexibility to both fund growth and provide current returns to shareholders. To fund our growth, we have committed that the proceeds from divestitures would be sequentially applied to: first, repay short-term debt of approximately $2.5 billion; second, to provide a $1 billion cash cushion; third, to fund the 2013 cash flow deficit; and four, to return cash to shareholders by repurchasing up to $4 billion of shares.","In addition, as John Hess stated earlier, the corporation will increase its annual dividend starting in the third quarter of 2013. Subsequent to our March 4 announcement of our transformation to a pure-play E&P company, S&P, Moody's and Fitch all maintained our mid-BBB rating. Following the completion of the sale of our Russian subsidiary, Samara-Nafta, we will be able to repay all remaining outstanding short-term debt and begin building our cash cushion. As John Hess mentioned earlier, we expect to begin our share repurchase program in the second half of this year as further planned asset sales are completed.","During the first quarter of 2013, the corporation generated net cash from continuing and discontinued operations of $819 million. The cash provided by operations, together with proceeds from asset sales of $1,326,000,000 and cash on hand, were used to fund $1,521,000,000 of capital expenditures and repay $752 million of outstanding borrowings.","We had $444 million of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2013 and $642 million at December 31, 2012. Total debt was $7,376,000,000 at March 31, 2013 and $8,111,000,000 at December 31, 2012. And the corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 24.7% at March 31, 2013, compared with 27.7% at the end of 2012.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Doug Terreson of ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to see -- a strategic question. I wanted to see if we can get an updated view on Australia in light of the recent commentary that Woodside is no longer going to seek third-party gas for its Pluto development. And then second, the next steps or plan for the other position, the one in the Beetaloo Basin in Australia. So 2 Australia questions.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, thanks, Doug. On your first question related to the offshore position in Western Australia 390-P, recall we are negotiating with 3 different parties for liquefaction of that gas. And so there's other parties besides Woodside in the mix. And both discussions are continuing with the parties. For the second thing on the Beetaloo Basin, we're in the process of processing the new seismic that we just shot. And then we have to make a drill-or-drop decision by midyear, and so that's where we are in the process.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Midyear '13?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, following up on your Bakken expectations, can you walk us through maybe right now -- I mean, are we seeing production actually declining into the month of May and kind of reflecting depletion rates? And then obviously, as wells come on, beginning in May all the way through the end of the year, production ramps up and could exceed your level, or 70 is really as good as it gets in 2013? I'm just trying to understand the moving parts there.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think as we announced previously, as a result of our switch to pad drilling from held-by-production drilling, you build inventory of drilled but not completed wells. So your completion rate is lower than what it was last year. So as a result of that, your production for the first 5 months of the year is flat to slightly declining. In the first quarter, our production was 65. For the next couple of months, that could decline just a little bit. So it'll be flattish. And then as we put wells on completion as we move the completion spreads in, our completion rate really doubles the last half of the year. So our production is very much back-end loaded for the year. As we said in the opening remarks, we feel confident of our range of 64,000 to 70,000 barrels a day.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on Ghana, what -- is there a timeline we can think about there in terms of -- okay, obviously great success story on the exploration front. You start working with the government here. I mean, I say \"start working.\" You already have been. But any expectations for when something might occur there that you could talk about in terms of a future development plan or anything like that?","Gregory P. Hill","Sure, I think -- so there's 2 things that we have to do. The first thing, which is the most important piece of business right now for us, is to get the approval -- appraisal program approved by the government. That has to occur by midyear, and so we're in the process of having those discussions with the Ghanaian government. In parallel, we're also doing predevelopment studies. Now once we get the appraisal program approved by the government, then we have a 2-year clock to get our appraisal activities done. So that kind of lays out a time frame for you. Lots of appraisal activity over the next couple of years, predevelopment studies in parallel, and then we aim to make a decision, obviously, after that appraisal period is done.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eliot Javanmardi from Capital One Southcoast.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Just a question. You spoke about, in the last quarter, your expectations for your Middle Bakken wells in EURs, and I want to say the range between 600,000 to 700,000 barrels equivalent. Are you seeing something along those lines with that range in the Middle Bakken? And also, I don't know if you can, but could you give us maybe a percentage acreage split on what you have in the Middle Bakken and Three Forks?","Gregory P. Hill","And I think as we said in our opening remarks, we plan to drill about 1\/3 of our wells in the Middle Bakken this year, right? And 2\/3 of the wells this year will be -- or sorry, 1\/3 Three Forks, 2\/3 Middle Bakken wells this year. Regarding your question on EUR, the range is still valid. The EURs in the first quarter that came out of the wells that we drilled were in the low 600,000s.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Very good. Last question, then. With the increasing appraisal activity likely for Ghana, should we expect the exploration budget to -- exploration appraisal budget to swell a bit in the coming years versus where we are now?","Gregory P. Hill","No, I think as we've guided previously, this $500 million to $600 million level is where we want to keep that budget. So we're going to fit -- live within those means.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Excellent. And lastly, on the Utica well, the Capstone well, could you -- was there a timing duration you guys could give on the results that you provided there? If not, I'll just leave it at that.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. On the Utica wells, we're trying to give comparables to what all the competitors are giving, so that -- these are early-time tests, right? Typically, 24-hour kind of test, right?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Greg, on the, I guess, the commentary around the Utica and the Bakken, there's a couple of questions, if I may. First of all, on the Bakken, what proportion of your acreage is perspective for Three Forks? And if you could maybe help us with how the activity level there might accelerate given that you're now starting to go to the Three Forks. And I guess a similar question on the Utica in terms of pace of development. I've got a follow-up, please.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Doug. I think as we previously discussed, the Three Forks underlies the majority of our acreage. And the acreage we consider core, this 550,000 to 650,000 acres, a lot of that is underlined by the Three Forks. Regarding the Three Forks, we have -- at the end of 2012, we had 52 wells in the Three Forks. By the end of this year, we'll have another 65 or so in the Three Forks. So that gives you a sense of where we are. And again, our drilling program, 1\/3 Three Forks this year, 2\/3 Middle Bakken.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess what I'm really trying to figure out is if you're -- you've essentially doubled your locations, then, if you're saying the Three Forks underlies most of the acreage. So what does that mean in terms of pace of development? I mean, 175 wells seems fairly modest given the opportunity set.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think, Doug, on the Three Forks, while it underlies all our acreage, we still have to do some appraisal of that. Just like everyone else, I think there will be really good parts of the Three Forks, which we've seen, and there may be some not so good parts of the Three Forks. So that's really what we have to figure out in our drilling program this year and next year is how much of that is really, really perspective. Our focus this year, obviously, in 2013 is capital efficiency, so we're going in and drilling some of the best locations in the Three Forks, as well as appraising some of the other acreage.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. So the same question for the Utica in terms of -- are we at the point where you're ready to talk about a development plan yet, or still too early?","Gregory P. Hill","No, Doug, it's -- gosh, it's still too early. I mean, to put it in context if you add up 2012 and 2013, we've drilled 11 wells in '12 and '13 so far, and we've only tested 10. So clearly, we've got a lot more drilling to do. We plan to drill about 30 wells this year. So at the end of this year, we'll have about 42 wells under our belt. And contrast that to the Bakken, of course, where we have over 600 wells. So it's still early days in the Utica. But we're encouraged by the results so far, particularly in Belmont, Jefferson, Harrison counties.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My quick follow-up is for John Rielly. It's on the operating cost guidance, John. Does that still include Russia? And can you -- now that you've got a deal in Russia, can you give an idea what the OpEx would look like, x Russia? And I'll leave it there.","John P. Rielly","Sure, Doug. And just to let you know, Doug, we do -- it's on our website now in that supplemental presentation, we have pro forma results up there showing what the portfolio would look like with Russia out, and Indonesia and Thailand, all the assets sold as if it went back to the beginning of 2012. But just to give you an answer to your questions here, if you're looking at 2013, what we expect from -- overall, first on our revenue per barrel revenue. Our revenue per barrel will go up over $5 a barrel because of Russia exiting the portfolio. So first, you get that higher uplift, then, on the revenue line. When it comes to cash cost, we see that basically from a guidance standpoint being relatively flat for the full year of pulling out all those assets. In the first quarter, for example, I told you the portfolio had a cash cost of $21.20. On a pro forma basis with the assets sold, it would have been $21.08. Now when it gets to DD&A, when you start removing some of these assets from DD&A, they have a lower overall DD&A rate in the portfolio. So we expect -- I would tell you the guidance then on the DD&A would be about $4 higher from an overall portfolio standpoint. And then, for example, in the first quarter, I said the DD&A rate for the total E&P assets were $19.28; for the first quarter pro forma basis would be $22.45. So that's our cost guidance. And just to round it off to give you all the guidance, on a tax -- what we see from a tax rate standpoint is somewhere around, from a portfolio standpoint, between 100 and 200 basis points higher. And we have some of the U.K. assets, obviously, with tax rates higher than the portfolio, but Russia and Azerbaijan being below it. And that's why the tax rate then effectively goes up. And then we expect, again, as we have said, that our cash margin overall goes up $5 per barrel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a few follow-up questions just on the Utica results. Just sounds like it's liquids-richy type gas at this point, mostly NGLs. If you can confirm that? And any comments on maybe the black oil potential of the Utica? Maybe you've not drilled that part yet, but any thoughts there would be very helpful.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. I think, particularly in Belmont, Jefferson and Harrison counties, we're in that liquids-rich part of the play. As you move east, as we've said before, in our Marquette acreage, then you move more into the dry gas as the Point Pleasant plunges deeper to the East. Regarding the oil activity in the West, so far, I would say the results are disappointing. It's like the Eagle Ford oil window. You get shallower, and the reservoir just doesn't have the energy required.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. Any update on Pony? I don't think I heard an update there.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Arjun. Pony, we're continuing the FEED, and we'll continue FEED through this year, and we're aiming for a sanction decision, both us and the partners, in 2014.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And we can add 4 years from sanction to start-up, something like that?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, that's probably a reasonable expectation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On your statement, you expect to begin the $4 billion buyback in the second half. I mean per your ordering of priorities in the opening comments, should we assume that you go to work only after you've paid down $2.5 billion of debt and built the $1 billion cash cushion?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, that's correct. And as I mentioned, we actually expect our Russian asset sale to close fairly soon. And with the proceeds from that, we will have fully paid off our short-term debt at that point. And actually, we'll be starting to build that cash cushion. So when we're saying the second half of the year is as these next asset sales come in, we're going to be in this position to be able to start buying back shares.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. So have you assumed, to work in the buyback in the second half, you're assuming that some number of the Indonesia, Thailand terminal sales are completed by year end. Is that fair?","Gregory P. Hill","That is fair.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And do you -- can you give me just the cash, the operating cash flow on the quarter? Were you just going to tell me what the working capital adjustment is?","Gregory P. Hill","The working capital was approximately $600 million in the first quarter. I mean, typically, in the first quarter, we have a very high working capital as you saw compared to the first quarter. I've already started to see some of that turn in April, and we expect, like usual, the majority of that to turn by the end of the year","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then lastly for me. On Valhall, can you discuss the ramp in 2013 or where the exit rate was in the quarter? And are you still on track for the average guidance of 24, 28 through '13?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Evan, as we said in our opening remarks, the operator forecast range of 24 to 28, we think we'll be at the low end of that range. First quarter production averaged about 5,000 barrels per day. Just as a reference point, production reached about 16,000 barrels per day by the middle of April. In addition to just the routine ramp, I'll say in the flesh production associated with that, you also have the drilling rigs in there with our aim to get 6 wells drilled this year. So there will be some back-end contribution from those wells also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Greg, when you say Valhall, say BP is 24 to 28, is that the gross number or your net to you?","Gregory P. Hill","No, no, that's net to us, Paul. Thank you, I should have clarified that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Net to you, okay. And on Ghana, is it too early that you gave a rough estimate of what you think may be the total recoverable resource of the 7 discoveries? And also, do you have a rough estimate on the liquid and gas split on those resource base?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Paul. It is too early to give a resource estimate for one reason. We're not allowed to speak about resources without the approval of the Ghanaian government. And they have not allowed us to do that until we get done with our appraisal plan. So that's the reason.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. How about, say, in terms of the split between the liquid and black oil and NGL and natural gas? Were you -- are you allowed to talk about that?","Gregory P. Hill","No, we can't do that yet either, Paul. But clearly, with our 7 discoveries and a number of them black oil, the predevelopment studies are focused on the black oil.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And going on the -- in Bakken, is there a rough estimate kind of number, then, or any, let's say, trend you can guide us that what is the cash operating cost right now and how that may look like in 2014?","John P. Rielly","Paul, there's no difference actually, I think, from basically what we have been guiding there in the Bakken right now. So including production and severance taxes, in North Dakota, when you put that together with our Bakken operating cost, the cash costs right now are just slightly below our portfolio average in the Bakken.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, when you say the portfolio average, you're talking about U.S. portfolio or total company portfolio?","John P. Rielly","Total company portfolio.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right now, you're slightly below total company?","John P. Rielly","I'm sorry?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right now, you're slightly below total company.","John P. Rielly","Yes. Yes, it is.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then how about your target for 2014?","John P. Rielly","Well, again, as production begins to ramp up, then obviously, then we -- you can take those fixed costs going over more barrels. So we see a declining cash cost per barrel. We'll be focused on that as well as just as the maturity of the reserve bookings and the additional wells coming on will be a slow decline in the DD&A rate as well.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But you're not going to be willing to give us some numbers, say that it declines by $2, $3 average for next year comparing to this year, or anything of that like that, that you can provide?","John P. Rielly","No. Not at this point. I mean first of all, we -- from guidance on next year and what we're doing capital and what wells we're going to drill and all that, I mean it would still -- very early for us to be able to do that. What we can say is, as we know our production is going to ramp up to 120,000 barrels a day, as we said, in mid-decade. So clearly, we can -- if you can tell from that standpoint that they'll just be the cost will go over more barrels. As Greg is saying -- has just alluded to, our well cost on our drilling completer coming down. So again, we've been basically focused in driving down operating costs, well cost. And so both cash costs and DD&A costs will decline over time. But I can't give you specific guidance on that at any point.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, how about in terms of on a pro forma basis that how's your CapEx going forward may look like, is that something that you can give some light?","John P. Rielly","Yes, sure. So first of all then, again, on the pro forma data that we included on the supplemental presentation. So on a pro forma basis, the capital was -- the capital and exploratory expenditures was $1,405,000,000 versus our total portfolio of $1,613,000,000 E&P. So it gives you some type of range from that standpoint. We've given guidance that on a pro forma basis, our full year capital would be $6.2 billion. So that's with all the assets out of the portfolio essentially effective at the beginning of the year. We clearly are giving guidance that our capital will have a 5 handle, can I call that in? So we'll have a 5 at the start of it. So our capital will be in the $5 billion range next year. I just can't give you any further guidance at that point. And with that driving that down, we expect with our portfolio and enhancement of the cash margin that we'll be driving towards a balance between cash flow and capital spend in 2014. And then beyond that, we expect to be able to become cash positive.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Greg, in Bakken, have you guys start testing on the down spacing to 160? And so far, what's the result in there?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we have, Paul. So we've done an awful lot of work in down spacing. I think the Bakken will be down spaced. That's clear from the pilots that we've run. The one thing I will say is the degree of down spacing will depend upon where you are in the field. And so for higher productivity areas, you probably don't need to down space as low as you might in some of the lower productivity areas of the field. So the answer is, is it depends on the degree of down spacing, but there will be down spacing potential in the Bakken.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A final one. Since that majority of your acreage is in the Three Forks, when do you think it's going to reach the inflection point you started drilling the majority of the well in Three Forks and not in the Middle Bakken?","Gregory P. Hill","Well gosh, Paul, we've got 2,500 well locations to drill and even more if you consider infill and --","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In the Middle Bakken?","Gregory P. Hill","No, in Middle Bakken and Three Forks combined. And then if you down space an infill lower in some parts of the field, obviously, that number's going to go up. We're prioritizing wells based on highest return and also in pads, where we can capitalize on the efficiencies, right, of being on the pad, say, drilling Middle Bakken wells. We'll add a couple of Three Forks since we're there on the pad, right? But as I said, I think, to Doug, we've got 52 Three Forks wells in the ground at the end of 2012. We'll have 65 more at the end of this year. So we'll have a good understanding of the Three Forks. In addition to that, we have 30 cores in the Three Forks. We've done a major study of the Three Forks, including all of the Three Forks production data that exists from the NDIC as well as our own data. So we have a pretty good understanding of Three Forks. It's going to be a good play for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Kessler of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I had a follow-up question on Stampede or Pony. You characterized this as being too early, I think, previously, to consider divestment of that asset. And I was curious what you need to see in order to possibly put it in the development queue? I know you've got pre-FID work ongoing. Is this more of a commercial kind of cost structure delineation that you need to accomplish, or is there more actual drilling you need to do to better understand the resource before deciding to sell?","Gregory P. Hill","No, I think this project will be at its maximum kind of value point at sanction, right? And so at that point in time, we'll know all the costs because FEED will be done. We have a good understanding of the subsurface already. It's a combination of our data plus the partner's data. And at the end of the day, the decision will be focused on returns.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","With a good understanding now of the subsurface, how many barrels do expect to recover for Stampede?","Gregory P. Hill","We haven't said that yet, only because we haven't got all the development studies done. That's part of the FEED process, right? We will announce that at the point of sanction, obviously.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then, unrelated question for me. Retail divestment. Have you gotten any further on that in terms of the form of that divestment may take? Are you considering a spinout, an IPO or an outright sale to a third party for cash?","John P. Rielly","Yes. We're looking at all options to maximize shareholder value. And as I said, in all of our downstream divestitures, the sales processes are well underway.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Scott Willis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Scott Willis on for Ed. I was just wondering, as far as the international asset portfolio, is there going to be further rationalization of that portfolio in the future beyond the assets already announced?","John B. Hess","We gave a lot of study between our leadership team, our board and advisors on the optimum portfolio to, hopefully, create the portfolio that will generate a lot of returns to our investors. And that's this focused liquids-rich portfolio that is lower risk with the 5% to 8% compounded average annual growth rate. So there are no current plans for any other divestitures there. It's a dynamic business. Obviously, we'll always look at opportunities as we move ahead to continue to refocus and strengthen our portfolio, but there are no current plans beyond the ones we've already announced.","Scott Willis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on reserve replacement, looking kind of longer term even past Ghana. Could you just talk a little bit about where you think that reserve replacement could come from?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, I think if you look at our portfolio and this 5% to 8% compounded annual growth rate that we've talked about, certainly, we'll be able to replace all of that in the 5-year period and some, right? And obviously, that comes from the Bakken, Utica, Ghana, North Malay Basin, T-Bells, all of the developments we've announced.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask about 2 international exploration areas that I don't think you've touched on yet. First, Kurdistan. I think you had 2 commitment wells for this year. Any status update on that?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So we are currently mobilizing drilling rigs to begin drilling in the back half of 2013 in Kurdistan.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, in the back half. Have you identified sites up for those?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we have. We've got both locations picked. They\u2019re in the process of building locations, roads, et cetera, to mobilize the rigs.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on your legacy acreage in France, obviously, the unconventional stuff is out of the picture right now. But are you still planning to do some conventional work this year?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. In fact, we finished one well, and the rig is moving to the second well. The first well, we cut almost 400 meters of core. So we got a lot of core out of the well. And now, the core is off to be studied. But so far, looks good. And the rig, as I said, is moving to the second well.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is this oil or gas?","Gregory P. Hill","Oil.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Hess for the closing remarks.","John B. Hess","Thank you. In closing, I'd like to say that we are excited about the opportunities for Hess and our shareholders. You've just heard how well we did in the first quarter, both operationally and in terms of our strategic repositioning. We are on track to complete our transformation into a pure-play E&P company and are also making steady progress towards increasing our future production at a compound average annual growth rate of 5% to 8%, as forecast on March 4.","Just as importantly, we expect to begin returning capital to shareholders, as John Rielly talked about, in the second half of this year as a consequence of these actions. We also have a wonderful opportunity to add a world-class slate of new and independent directors to our board. John Krenicki is the former Vice Chairman of GE, former President and CEO of GE Energy and a partner at Clayton, Dubilier. Kevin Meyers was the senior executive, ConocoPhillips, that led their U.S. E&P business, transformed it and spearheaded development of their U.S. unconventional plays. Fred Reynolds is one of the best CFOs in Corporate America. He created tremendous value at CBS and later Viacom, transforming those companies and making them leaders in returning capital to shareholders, and is lead Independent Director at AOL. Bill Schrader is the person BP put in charge of its best and most valued E&P assets, including ACG in Azerbaijan, BP exploration Angola, TNK-BP in Russia. And Mark Williams is well known as one of the best oil and gas executives in the industry. He was on the executive committee of Royal Dutch Shell and has spent 2\/3 of his 33-year career in the upstream and midstream businesses. Their objectivity and counsel have already been a tremendous addition to our company, and all of us at Hess look forward to continuing to benefit from their extensive experience in the future.","Finally, I'd like to thank our shareholders for their thoughtful input and continued support. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, John. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Gary, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Hess","Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will provide some key highlights on the quarter and the progress we are making in executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then review our operations and John Rielly will go over our financial results.","I thought it would be appropriate, before discussing our third quarter results, to make a few comments about recent volatility in oil prices. As most of you know, we have used $100 Brent as the basis for our plans even as Brent has averaged nearly $110 for the last 3 years. However, with Brent now at approximately $87 per barrel, we are reviewing our plans and actions that we might take in a lower-price environment.","As always, we are taking a disciplined approach to: first, allocate capital to the projects with the highest risk-adjusted returns; second, maintain a strong balance sheet and a high degree of financial flexibility; and third, manage capital and exploratory spending within limits of our cash flow over the long term after continuing to return capital to our shareholders.","And we look forward to sharing our plans in more detail with you at our upcoming Investor Day on November 10. Also we will release our 2015 capital and exploratory budget, as usual, in January 2015.","Now turning to our financial results for the third quarter of 2014. Net income was $1,008,000,000 or $377 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted net income per share was $1.24 compared to $1.18 in the year-ago quarter. Cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion.","Compared with the third quarter of 2013, our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and NGL sales volumes and lower exploration expense, which were offset by lower realized crude selling prices and higher depreciation expenses.","Net production in the third quarter averaged 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This represents an increase of 17% from pro forma production of 269,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the year-ago quarter, excluding Libya.","Now we will review highlights from the quarter. Starting onshore. Net production in the Bakken averaged 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up 21% from the third quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter, we forecast net Bakken production will average between 92,000 and 97,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","We continue to focus on drilling some of the lowest-cost, highest-return wells in the Bakken. In the third quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $7.2 million, down 8% from the year-ago quarter, and our wells continue to be among the most productive in the play.","The Utica is positioned to be a material contributor to our production growth over the next 5 years. We and our partner, CONSOL, have a core acreage position in the wet gas window. During the quarter, production averaged 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Moving offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess has a 57% interest and is operator, is completing its final checks and is expected to achieve first production within the next week. Following a ramp-up period, Tubular Bells is expected to deliver net production of approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by year-end.","Yesterday, we announced that we will proceed with the development of Stampede, a deepwater oil and gas project operated by Hess in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico. Hess has a 25% working interest and is the operator. Chevron, Statoil and Exxon each have a 25% working interest. Total recoverable resources for Stampede are estimated in the range of 300 million to 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. First production is expected in 2018.","In terms of overall company production, we are on track to average toward the upper end of our 2014 pro forma production forecast of 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. In terms of divestitures, the sale of our retail business closed during the third quarter for cash proceeds of $2.8 billion. The sale of our HETCO energy trading business was announced on Monday and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. Also we continue to negotiate with a potential buyer for the sale of the HOVENSA joint venture refinery in St. Croix, which we hope to complete in the near future. We continue to make progress in our plans to monetize our Bakken midstream infrastructure in 2015 through an MLP structure, which will allow Hess to retain operational control while realizing additional value from our infrastructure investment.","During the third quarter, the corporation's wholly owned subsidiary, Hess Midstream Partners LP, filed an initial Form S-1 with the SEC in preparation for its proposed initial public offering in 2015.","Based on the sale of our retail business, we increased our share repurchase authorization to $6.5 billion from $4 billion. Year-to-date, through October 28, we have repurchased 34.7 million shares for $3.1 billion. Since the commencement of the program in August of 2013, we have repurchased 54 million shares for $4.6 billion. We will continue to implement this program in a disciplined manner and provide quarterly updates on future conference calls.","In summary, we are delivering strong performance and executing our plan. With our focused, balanced portfolio and strong balance sheet, we are well positioned in the current price environment to drive cash-generative growth and sustainable returns for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory P. Hill","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide a brief review of the progress we're making in executing our E&P strategy.","In the third quarter, we again demonstrated continuing delivery against plan. Starting with unconventionals. In the third quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2014. We operated 17 rigs and brought 59 Bakken wells online in the third quarter. This was up from 53 wells in the preceding quarter.","In the fourth quarter, we plan to have 6 frac crews working and expect to bring more than 80 new wells online. Thus far in October, we have brought 30 new wells online, and net production has averaged 91,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","For the fourth quarter, we forecast net production in the Bakken to average between 92,000 and 97,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We anticipate that full year 2014 Bakken production guidance will be toward the lower end of our range of 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This reflects delays in bringing the Tioga gas plant online at the beginning of the year as well as permitting delays for the Hawkeye South of the River Pipeline, which has prevented additional gas volumes from being processed at the Tioga plant.","Inlet volumes to the Tioga plant continue to increase, and the plant is currently processing approximately 160 million cubic feet per day and 31,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day of natural gas liquids. We expect to fill the plant to capacity in 2015 and are evaluating low-cost options to expand the current capacity from 250 million to 300 million cubic feet per day. Our 13 and 17 well per DSU downspacing pilots are progressing well and performing in line with expectations. We will provide an update of the results from these pilots at our Investor Day in November.","Drilling and completion costs continue to be reduced in the Bakken with the third quarter averaging $7.2 million per well versus $7.8 million per well in the year-ago quarter and $7.4 million per well in the second quarter of this year. We continue to make steady progress in reducing costs as a result of our unique lean manufacturing approach, and we see room to continue to drive these costs lower.","Based on our top quartile drilling and completion cost and the productivity of our wells, we believe we are delivering some of the highest-return wells in the play. In the Utica, the appraisal and early development of our 44,000 core net acres in the Hess-CONSOL joint venture continues to be encouraging.","In the third quarter, the joint venture drilled 10 wells, completed 11 wells and brought 18 wells on production. In the third quarter, the joint venture also tested 14 new wells, 7 of which were Hess-operated. Test results from the Hess-operated wells located in Harrison and Belmont Counties averaged approximately 2,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 47% liquids based on 24-hour tests.","In the third quarter, net production averaged 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the prior quarter. We intend to provide an update of our forward plans for the Utica at our Investor Day.","Turning to offshore. Progress continues in Tubular Bells, Stampede, North Malay Basin and Valhall. At Tubular Bells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 57% working interest and is operator, we are in the final stages of commissioning and anticipate achieving first oil within the next week. From there, we will ramp up net production from 3 wells to approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by year-end.","Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stampede development project, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, was recently sanctioned by all 4 partners. Building on the successful execution of our Tubular Bells project, Stampede will develop one of the largest remaining discovered Miocene fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and is expected to deliver first oil in 2018.","A 2-rig drilling program is planned with the first rig commencing operations in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross topsides processing capacity for the project is approximately 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 100,000 barrels of water injection capacity per day. Gross recoverable resource is estimated to be in the range of 300 million to 350 million barrels of oil equivalent.","At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% working interest and is operator, third quarter net production averaged 40 million cubic feet per day through the Early Production System. Engineering work continues on the full-field development project, which will increase net production to 160 million cubic feet per day in 2017.","In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, third quarter production averaged 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. This was primarily due to a seasonal planned maintenance shutdown. Full year production for Valhall is still expected to average in the range of 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net, supported by 3 new wells, which are planned to be brought on in the fourth quarter.","Company-wide pro forma production in the fourth quarter is forecast to be between 330,000 and 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Full year production is forecast to be toward the upper end of our 2014 pro forma production of 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.","Moving to exploration. In Kurdistan, where Hess has a 64% interest, we resumed drilling in the Shireen-1 well on the Dinarta block earlier this month following a 2-month suspension due to the security situation. We expect to reach total depth in the first quarter of 2015.","In Ghana, Hess and its partner successfully completed our appraisal drilling program in the third quarter. Results are encouraging, and once the data from the appraisal drilling and new 3D seismic have been incorporated into our models, we will provide an update as appropriate.","In closing, this quarter is yet another demonstration of strong execution against our plan and delivery of key milestones.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thanks, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2014 to the second quarter of 2014. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $1,008,000,000 in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $931 million in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted net income was $377 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $432 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to Exploration and Production. E&P had income of $441 million in the third quarter and $1,057,000,000 in the second quarter of 2014. E&P adjusted net income was $412 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $483 million in the previous quarter.","The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted net income were as follows. Changes in realized selling prices decreased net income by $81 million. Lower sales decreased net income by $23 million. Lower exploration expenses increased net income by $59 million. Lower cash costs increased net income by $20 million. Higher DD&A expense decreased net income by $38 million. All other items net to a decrease in net income of $8 million for an overall decrease in third quarter adjusted net income of $71 million.","Our E&P crude oil sales volumes were overlifted compared with production by approximately 300,000 barrels. However, the impact to net income was immaterial in the quarter. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, was 41% for the third quarter and 34% in the second quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting the impact of a Libyan crude oil lifting in the third quarter.","Turning to corporate and interest. Corporate and interest expenses, net of income taxes, were $80 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $91 million in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted corporate and interest expenses were $78 million in the third quarter and $82 million in the second quarter.","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter, including a decrease of $170 million from changes in working capital, was $1,338,000,000. Net proceeds from asset sales were $2,956,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,362,000,000. Common stock acquired and retired amounted to $903 million. Repayments of debt amounted to $53 million. Common stock dividends paid were $76 million. All other items amounted to an increase in cash of $15 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $1,915,000,000.","Turning to our stock repurchase program. During the third quarter, we purchased approximately 9.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $903 million, bringing cumulative purchases for the program through September 30, 2014, to 49.4 million shares at a cost of $4.2 billion or $85.14 per share. We have continued to buy back our common stock. And through October 28, total program-to-date purchases were 54 million shares at a cost of $4.6 billion or $85.03 per share.","Turning to our financial position. We had $4,120,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2014, compared with $1,814,000,000 at the end of last year, primarily reflecting the collection of proceeds from the sale of the retail business. Total debt was $5,996,000,000 at September 30, 2014, compared with $5,798,000,000 at December 31, 2013. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30, 2014, was 19.7% and 19% at the end of 2013.","Turning to guidance. I would like to provide fourth quarter 2014 guidance for certain metrics. E&P cash operating cost per barrel of oil equivalent are estimated to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50, and E&P DD&A per barrel is expected to be in the range of $29 to $30. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur exploration expenses, other than dry hole costs, in the range of $180 million to $200 million. The fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 41% to 43%, excluding Libya. Fourth quarter corporate expenses are expected to be between $35 million and $40 million after income taxes, and after-tax interest expenses are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million.","Given the current volatility in crude oil prices, we are providing additional guidance with respect to price sensitivities on fourth quarter results. Based on the fourth quarter guidance provided, we estimate that every $1 change in crude oil benchmark prices will result in a change in fourth quarter net income of approximately $8 million. This estimate includes the impact of the corporation's crude oil hedge contracts outstanding at September 30, 2014.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Ed Westlake of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I'm sure there's going to be lots of questions on the Bakken and also on the Stampede project. On the Bakken, you've got a $7.2 million well cost. Others are actually increasing their costs to drive the initial cums. and overall recovery is higher. Is your strategy still going to be to try and focus on these, I guess, relatively simpler completions, and they're giving you acceptable returns? Or are you going to go down the route of boosting the, I guess, the frac intensity, et cetera?","Gregory P. Hill","Ed, this is Greg. Currently, our standard design is 35 stages, and there's a lot of significant amount of data that supports the sliding sleeve technology as being as effective as plug and perf in terms of IP and EUR as well as being a significant lower cost completion. Now, as always, we continue to experiment and pay very close attention to what competitors are doing, and we've trialed some of these more expensive completion designs, but thus far, none have proven to be economically superior to our methodology. Again we're focused on drilling the highest-return Bakken wells.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on Stampede, $6 billion for 320 million F&D cost. I mean, that works probably at a decent level of oil price, and obviously we know it's very deep. But I guess do you think those costs have room to fall, given what's going on in the offshore industry at this point? Or do you think that's a pretty good metric?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, certainly Stampede, first of all, is one of the largest undeveloped fields in the GOM, and the project returns are expected to exceed our investment threshold even in this lower-priced environment, and I think it's noteworthy that all 4 partners have sanctioned the project with a final sanction coming in this week. I do think costs do have room. I mean, certainly the diamond rig contract that is tied to this project for 2 years, 7 straight years in total, I think set a new market benchmark for deepwater rig rates.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess my question is, is that included in the $6 billion number? Or is that potentially an optimization around it?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, it is. It is included in the $6 billion number.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wonder if I could take 2, please. My first one is actually in Norway. So obviously maintenance in the third quarter, but I wonder if you could just give us an update as to how you see the Norwegian production outlook for the potential for BP to really start to ramp this thing over the next couple of years relative to your current guidance. And I guess what's behind my question is: this is obviously a non-declining asset. You're not paying cash taxes on it, but the production contribution always seems to be kind of challenged. So what are your strategic thoughts around what you can do in Norway and whether you're optimistic that it gets better. I've got a follow-up, please.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Doug. As we've said before and as you mentioned, Norway is a huge cash machine for us. Obviously, with brand-new facilities and 40-year life, we have every interest as does BP to maximize the production off of that facility. And our net production goal is still in the range of 40,000 to 50,000 barrels a day in 2017. So how is it going? Well, we've established regular multilevel executive engagements with BP management. In fact, John and I are flying to London tomorrow for our third meeting, and there's a lot of work left to be done, but we are encouraged by the progress. So the reliability of the plant's better. Recent well results leveraging our South Arne drilling and completion experience are encouraging in terms of both cost and schedule. So cautiously optimistic on Valhall.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Do you think you can ever get the platform capacity on it?","Gregory P. Hill","That's what we're going to try and drive to do. How long that takes, again, is just going to be a function of price, CapEx and delivery from BP.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, my follow-up is on the Bakken, as you would expect, I suppose, but unfortunately, I haven't been able to access the supplement this morning, so I haven't been able to see what latest 30-day rates were like. But I'm guessing that the downspacing wells that you -- I think was about half your program more or less this year, I'm guessing they've been performing pretty much in line with what you'd expected at the beginning of the year. So not to preempt November 10, but I'm just kind of curious as to how you're thinking about the activity level there, given the potential to expand the inventory but traded off against what is obviously looking like a lower oil price. And I guess what's behind my thinking is you're coming into this lower oil price at a very robust balance sheet. So would that be -- would you still look to accelerate activity? Or would you look to moderate to look for the cashable amount? I'll leave it there.","Gregory P. Hill","Okay. Well, just to kind of give everyone an update on the downspacing pilots. Just recall in 2014, we have 2 well-designed pilots going on. We have 17 well pads with 13 wells per DSU, and we have 2 well pads with 17 wells per DSU. So those, respectively, represent a 700-foot between well spacing and a 500-foot well spacing. And results so far are in line with expectations. And Doug, we plan to provide a complete update on the downspacing pilots and what it means for our long-term Bakken guidance on Investor Day in November. So stay tuned.","Operator","And we have our next question from the line of Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. Maybe somewhat of a follow-up to Doug's comment if I missed it. Did I understand your opening comments, John, that your targeted CapEx to be within cash flow for '15? Or does it -- or is it kind of longer term mean there's some view of normal cash flow and you'd be willing to outspend if we find ourselves in a lower oil price scenario given your cash and balance sheet positions?","John B. Hess","Very good question. Look, with our focused, balanced portfolio underpinned in the unconventionals with very strong positions in the Bakken and Utica as well as our offshore and international assets generating free cash flow with some growth and our strong balance sheet, we're really well positioned in the current environment to drive cash-generative growth as well as sustainable returns for our shareholders. So given current prices, we're going to be guided to invest with a disciplined approach to allocate capital to projects with the highest risk-adjusted returns. And remember that our hurdle rate is to meet at least a 15% return, and that accounts for current prices. We're going to be guided to maintain a strong balance sheet and keep our financial flexibility. So accordingly, we'll manage our capital expenditures in line with this, but it is over the long term. So depending upon market movements, we may use our balance sheet some. But I think the important thing is we are going to definitely be guided to live within our cash flow over the longer term while continuing to return capital to shareholders. So the exact details on this, we'll provide you a pretty comprehensive update on November 10.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, I look forward to that. But maybe a follow-up on that return comment. Hess is moving against a trend offshore with Stampede FID. Well, I know it's been a long time coming. I mean, can you discuss how you compare and analyze returns or payback when making an allocation for new offshore projects versus your unconventional resource opportunity?","John B. Hess","Yes, again at current prices, and Greg mentioned this before. It has to meet our hurdle rate of 15% accounting for risk and whether that's an unconventional project or an offshore project, and Stampede met the threshold and in fact, beat it.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. Maybe one last, if I could, and maybe you can't comment due to the filing. But is there -- when you FID a project like Stampede, I mean, is there any MLP-able [ph] component there whether it's topside capacity or otherwise? Or is that all leased? I'll leave it there.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, since we're in the quiet period right now, Evan, we can't make any comments on what potentially could be included in the MLP.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Is it a lease design? Is that what's envisioned?","John P. Rielly","On Stampede, no, it's not a lease design. This is being built as -- Hess is the operator. We are building that facility along with our partners.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. A question on the Utica, and the Utica has an exceptionally strong quarter. Was that a result of better-than-expected well results, higher completion count? And how should we think about activity levels and production growth there in the fourth quarter and going forward?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Thanks, Ryan. It was really a combination of both. A little bit of higher activity in terms of getting wells online. We had a real strong quarter there. I think the second thing is, is we are leading the industry in terms of lateral length, so we're drilling 8,800-foot laterals now, which is the longest ones to date at least in the Utica. So that contributed to the strong well results. Regarding future plans for the Utica, we're going to provide again a full update on the results and our forward plans for the Utica at Investor Day in November.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And if I could ask one follow-up as well. In the Bakken, based on -- I guess can you talk a little bit about -- you talked about the activity levels in October. I mean, I think from a completion point of view, to hit your full year targets, you probably need to bring on close to 80 to 90 wells in the fourth quarter. How many rigs are you running right now? And -- I guess, yes, how many rigs are you running in the fourth quarter? And should we be good to be on pace for that 80 to 90 completion target?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we're on track for that. We're running 17 rigs currently. And as we said in our opening remarks, we're going to have 6 frac crews working, and we expect to bring more than 80 wells online in the fourth quarter. And I think it's important that in -- just to give you some color on that, in October, we've already brought 30 new wells online. So we're on pace to do so.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Guy Baber of Simmons.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Strategic question for me to start off, but obviously in the Bakken you have a huge core position, very advantaged infrastructure position, operations improving there and you have a conservative balance sheet with a lot of cash. So one could view you longer term, I think, as a natural consolidator in that play. So the question is do opportunistic acquisitions have a part in your strategy fundamentally in the Bakken, particularly if this lower oil price environment were to persist and valuations came in a bit? And along those lines, do you feel the company's positioned in a way to take advantage of those opportunities? And does that think -- or is that impact the way you think about the buyback at all over the next quarters?","John B. Hess","Yes. There were a number of questions there. First of all, we're always going to be disciplined in our investment to invest for returns. So we're always going to look to optimize our portfolio, but it's got to be focused on investing for returns and keeping a strong balance sheet. Now the strong balance sheet obviously gives us flexibility. So if there were opportunities out there to optimize our portfolio to strengthen our hand and it met our return threshold, we will have a open mind on that for sure. But having said that, the key is when it comes to investment, we're going to be disciplined focusing on returns, and I've talked about that earlier. In terms of the buyback, it's an ongoing program, and we're going to be disciplined in our approach there.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, great. Very helpful, and then a detailed follow-up on the Bakken. Your oil production was actually down slightly quarter-on-quarter despite the overall increase from 80,000 to 86,000 barrels a day. You had a big increase in NGLs. So understanding that the mix can be volatile from one quarter to the next, I was just hoping you could maybe provide some commentary on the drivers there. And as we think about production going forward, should we still be thinking around about an 80% oil cut or so? So if you could just comment on that, that would be helpful.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So thank you for that, Guy. If you look on a barrel equivalent basis, obviously, our production was actually higher than Q2 and continues to trend upward. What happened in the third quarter was there were some heavy rains in the quarter, and that resulted in some county-imposed road closures, which then led to a higher level of well downtime due to some transportation constraints. So -- and as you mentioned given the typical oil-gas mix of a Bakken well, this downtime preferentially hurts oil production much more than it does gas production. So that's why you've got this swing.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Several -- hopefully 3 short questions. Greg, in Valhall, can you remind us, or maybe this is for Rielly, that when the cash tax is going to resume, is it 2017 or 2018?","John P. Rielly","Yes, so the guidance that we've given is that we're not paying cash taxes in Norway through 2017.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So 2018 will resume. And then earlier when we're talking about a 15% project hurdle rate, just want to clarify that. Is it based on $100 Brent or based on $85 Brent?","John B. Hess","Well, our old standard was $100 Brent, but as we allocate capital now, we're going to be disciplined in how we invest. So it would have to meet it at the $85 hurdle.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So that actually is a change in some way, that it's become tougher or that you raised the bar from previously $100 now to $85 Brent.","John B. Hess","Yes, you have to deal with the current reality of where the oil markets are.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's good. And John -- this is for Rielly, that fourth -- at the end of the third quarter, from an inventory standpoint, I presume that you are overlift -- any idea of how much you are overlift?","John P. Rielly","So for the fourth quarter, just for guidance going forward on the fourth quarter, we don't see an -- basically an under or overlift, a pretty balanced sales volume versus production. Excluding, Paul, it's excluding Libya. So with Libya in there, we could end up, if they have lifts continuing in the fourth quarter, could end up in an overlift position with Libya. But excluding that, from the equation, there's no projected under or overlift in the fourth quarter.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. And that the -- in Utica, Greg, are you running a 3-rig program right now?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we are, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then how many well is actually in production to contribute the 11,000 barrel per day?","Gregory P. Hill","Let's see. The online production well count for the Utica in the third quarter was 4 wells, and we've got -- sorry, I'm looking at my notes here. Sorry about that. So we've got -- in the third quarter, we have 10 -- we have 28 wells that have been drilled year-to-date in the Utica. Sorry, it took me a minute to find that number.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","28 wells drilled, but how many of them is actually in production?","Gregory P. Hill","Look, I'm just looking at my notes, Paul. I'm sorry. It's going to take me just a second. So online in this year, all of the JV wells and our wells, we've got 31 wells online.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then do you have a rough split between oil condensate NGL and natural gas in Utica?","Gregory P. Hill","So Paul, just -- let me just give you the numbers that we have in the quarter. So of the 11,000 barrels a day, there are -- it's just under 2,000 barrels a day is condensate. Just above 2,000 barrels a day are NGLs, and the rest of it, so on a 7,000 barrels a day oil equivalent is gas.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. And John, can you comment about the press release, talk about HOVENSA sales and that the $1.6 billion number signed [ph] by the government. Does that mean that when you finally decided, should we assume that you will receive any upfront payment from that sales?","John B. Hess","We're in the negotiation phase now with a third party, and I wouldn't want to get ahead of ourselves, Paul. When we have something definitive to say, we'll say it.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, a final one. For 2014 exploration expense based on your fourth quarter estimate, it's about call it $460 million. Going forward, is that a reasonable proxy? Or that 2014 is just not drilling a lot of wells so that going forward, the exploration expense may be higher than this level?","John P. Rielly","Yes, so -- I mean, we've been guiding basically that we've been, like, especially in the near term that our exploration program overall from a spend standpoint would be between $500 million and $600 million. And in fact, our guidance this year was $550 million, and so we're not giving guidance yet. We'll talk a little bit more about exploration on Investor Day and go forward, but that's where we've been. So we're right in line with the guidance that we have set out.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Given your position in the Bakken, both in terms of acreage and infrastructure, first, could you clarify, John, I think you were saying that you have to take into account oil prices in terms of your activity. Equally, I think I heard you in your opening remarks say that you wanted to live within cash flow long term, which implied that you would maintain a relatively high level of activity over the next year. That was part one, and part two, could you make any observations about how you see the wider behavior of players in the Bakken, given the current price environment? Do we anticipate less activity at these prices? Do we think prices have to go lower before we see an impact?","John B. Hess","I think one of the things -- I can't talk about others. Let them speak for themselves, but in our case, we have a very strong balance sheet. We're drilling some of the lowest-cost, high-productive wells so our breakeven is lower. We have some of the best acreage. We're certainly going to be focused on investing for returns as opposed to growth for growth's sake. So we're going to be capital disciplined in this price environment, but with the acreage that we have, many of our wells still generate very good returns even in the current price environment. So the exact details on what our program is going to be going forward and our planning premises, we'll give you further details on November 10.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Sure. I think the perspective of others was to do with your infrastructure position. I mean, are you seeing lower volumes? And can I just throw in also if you saw any impact from the flaring rules in North Dakota?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Paul. So given our infrastructure position in the Bakken, we don't anticipate any impacts due to the NDIC flaring rules. So we're well positioned to continuously reduce our flaring on a go-forward basis.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","And then volumes from the basin given the lower oil price environment in terms of your infrastructure.","John B. Hess","No, we're not seeing major volume impacts as of right now.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just getting back to the kind of initial comments about where crude oil prices are, and I recognize some of this will be handled in 2 weeks. But looking at the North Sea, which has historically been considered a relatively high-cost area, and I recognize Valhall's pretty far along. But could you give us an idea of kind of where it falls in given, say, a sub-$90 Brent environment as opposed to a plus or minus $100 Brent environment?","John P. Rielly","Sure. I mean, again where we are with the -- with both our North Sea investments, so Valhall and South Arne, the infrastructure basically is there. It's completed so all our big spend is behind it. So as you said, you've got just your general operating costs, but at $80, as you mentioned, with where our operating costs are and in Valhall where we're not paying cash taxes, it will still generate. Our North Sea assets, our offshore assets in general, too, are going to generate significant cash flow for us.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So quite a lot of headroom on both of those then.","John P. Rielly","Yes.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And reasonable to presume it makes sense to continue to invest and not just to operate on that sort of an $80 to $90 environment?","John P. Rielly","Yes. I mean, it is generalized. John Hess had mentioned earlier it's that balanced portfolio. It is our offshore assets that are funding the growth on the unconventional side. So it definitely makes sense and some of our best return projects are there.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And last question I have is just really 2 areas that have been, well, let's just say security issues both Libya and Kurdistan. Can you give us kind of an update of what you're seeing in terms of any changes in Libya from, say, the middle of the third quarter to the present? And then what was it that gave you confidence to go back into Kurdistan and restart the exploration well there after the 2-month hiatus.","John B. Hess","Yes. In terms of Libya, look, there's still significant political unrest in the country and a lot of instability, but the oil's flowing. And so far from our Waha concession, we have sold 3 cargoes of Es Sider crude. So the oil business is up and running. But in terms of how the political unrest gets resolved, that's still very much an open issue. So security is still an issue there. And in terms of Kurdistan, you've read the news. I think the country's a lot more secure today after the United States and allies have stood by the Kurds, and security's the #1 concern for our company and safety of all of our employees and contractors. And once we were given the assurances we needed about security, we staged a reentry into the country.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Most of my questions have been answered, but I would like to ask -- having completed the Almond 2, what is the current timeline for the progression of your offshore Ghana prospects?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So in terms of obligations to the government, we have to file a declaration of commerciality first. And after that, we would have to file a development plan middle of the year next year with the government. So we're actively evaluating the results of the appraisal plan. We've also got some new 3D seismic that we're also processing. Once that's done and once that's reviewed with our partners and reviewed with the government, then we can give you much more color on Ghana.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","But at least at this time, you can say that the drilling portion of it is done pending these further developments.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes.","Operator","And so the next question is from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can I go back to Kurdistan for a moment? Now that you guys are drilling with Petroceltic, as I understand, the Shireen-1 prospect is kind of the near-term catalyst. Is there a pre-drill resource estimate for that?","Gregory P. Hill","No, we haven't given one, and we expect to reach TD in that well in Q1 of 2015.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. That's fair enough. And then on Libya, you mentioned the 3 cargoes so far, given that operations are, well, maybe not normal but certainly improving versus a year ago, have you had a chance with the other partners to actually assess the state of the infrastructure relative to any potential physical damage, anything like that?","John B. Hess","No, we're not in a position to comment on that.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wanted to understand the supplement that you guys put out on the Utica JV well test. I'd just like to confirm that those well tests up there from 1,500 BOE a day to almost 4,000 BOE a day are all for the third quarter. And I just want to make sure that, that sort of is coming through into the fourth quarter as well.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, those are the third quarter results from the wells actually, and those are our wells. In addition, CONSOL also tested 7 wells from their operated pads. But these are our wells drilled and completed and tested in the quarter.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I mean, these are pretty huge results. I mean, what's the game plan in terms of sort of moving some of those gas and liquids out? I mean, 4,000 BOE test is still pretty substantial. Are these -- what's the well sort of -- well like that doing a month later or 2 months later?","Gregory P. Hill","We'll give you -- again in Investor Day in November, we'll give you a full kind of update on the Utica, how it's performing, the play and also where we're going in the future with it.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And just on Tubular Bells, as that facility ramps up, what's the quality of crude coming out of that field? Is it sort of a Mars Blend? Or is it something that we should expect more of an LLS type of crude?","John B. Hess","It'll have an LLS typing -- LLS relationship in terms of pricing.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of moving your crude out of the Bakken, has anything changed with regard to how you're moving your crude out or how you're thinking about moving your crude out, whether it's rail or pipeline? There've been a number of pipeline projects announced. So I just want to understand sort of what your game plan is for those volumes in the future.","John B. Hess","Yes. Currently, we move approximately 50% of our crude by pipeline and 50% by rail. And as our production ramps up in the future, you can expect that, that balance will stay roughly in place. We are subscribing to more pipeline space, but we're also looking at adding some more railcars to make sure we have the infrastructure in place to move to the highest value markets.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Then last question for me. The sale of HETCO, how much capital or working capital does that free up from -- within the company on the balance sheet?","John P. Rielly","So just so you know, we have not disclosed the terms, the proceeds associated with the sale because it is confidential. And from a general aspect, it's not going to be material to our financial statements.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. The risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental earnings information provided on our website.","With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President, Worldwide Exploration and Production; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will make a few high-level comments on the quarter and the progress we are making in executing our strategy to become a pure play E&P company. Greg Hill will then discuss our E&P operations, and John Rielly will then go over our financial results.","Net income for the second quarter of 2013 was $1.4 billion, or $520 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.51 compared to $1.72 in the year-ago quarter. Net production in the second quarter averaged 341,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 429,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in last year's second quarter.","Asset sales associated with our strategic portfolio reshaping accounted for approximately 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or 80% of the decline versus last year's second quarter. Planned downtime at the Valhall Field in June and lower entitlement under the production sharing contract at the Malaysia\/Thailand JDA accounted for the balance of the decline, which is partially offset by higher production from the Bakken.","In the second quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 16% from a year ago. As a result of our transition to pad drilling, we expect to see an increase in production in the second half of the year.","Our full year 2013 production forecast for the Bakken remains 64,000 to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Bakken well costs declined to $8.4 million in the second quarter, down 28% from the year-ago quarter.","For the corporation, our full year 2013 production forecast remains 340,000 to 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Taking into account the impact of asset sales, our pro forma 2013 production is expected to average 290,000 to 305,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from pro forma production of 289,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2012.","From our pro forma 2012 base, we expect to achieve a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 5% to 8% through 2017 and growth in the mid-teens in aggregate from 2012 to 2014. This production growth will come from captured lower-risk assets, including the Bakken, Valhall, Tubular Bells, North Malay Basin and the Utica.","Our portfolio reshaping moves have improved our cash margin. Second quarter 2013 pro forma upstream cash margin was $54 per barrel of oil equivalent, up $6 per barrel of oil equivalent from last year's actual second quarter results despite Brent oil prices declining more than $5 per barrel.","Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first half of 2013 were $3.2 billion, which was down 20% from the first half of 2012. This decline reflects improved capital efficiency in the Bakken, the impact of asset sales, as well as the declining capital intensity of our portfolio. Our full year 2013 capital and exploratory expenditures forecast remains $6.8 billion. We continue to project that 2014 capital and exploratory expenditures will be significantly lower than 2013 and more aligned with our cash flow.","We continue to make steady progress in executing our divestiture program. During the second quarter, we completed approximately $2.2 billion in asset sales, including the sale of our interest in Samara-Nafta for $1.9 billion. This brought completed asset sales as of June 30 to $3.5 billion. Proceeds were used to repay $2.4 billion of debt and to strengthen our balance sheet so that the company will have the financial flexibility to fund our future growth.","Yesterday, we announced the sale of our Energy Marketing business to Direct Energy for $1.025 billion. This business markets natural gas, electricity and fuel oil to 23,000 commercial, industrial and small business customers in the eastern half of the United States. The sale of our Energy Marketing business brings year-to-date asset sales to $4.5 billion and puts the company in a position to commence our previously announced share repurchase program. The remaining divestment processes for our upstream assets in Indonesia and Thailand, as well as our downstream terminals, retail and trading businesses are well underway.","We believe that our strategy to become a pure play E&P company will create significant long-term value. Our focus is on execution, growing production, driving further reductions in capital expenditures and operating costs, completing our remaining asset sales and increasing cash returns to shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to Greg, who will provide an operational update.","Gregory P. Hill","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide a brief review of the progress we're making in executing our E&P strategy. As previously discussed, Hess is executing a 3-pronged growth strategy through: one, unconventionals, with growth driven by the Bakken and Utica; two, exploitation, with growth driven by Tubular Bells, Valhall and North Malay Basin; and three, focused exploration in areas such as Ghana. This balanced strategy underpins the 5% to 8% compound annual production growth rate that John just laid out.","Starting with unconventionals. In the second quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 16% from the second quarter of 2012. As we had previously indicated, our Bakken production was relatively flat in the first half of 2013 as a result of our transition to pad drilling. That transition is now largely complete, and we will see higher production in the second half of the year.","There will be planned downtime in the Bakken during the fourth quarter as we complete the expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant. And while natural gas production will be partially curtailed for approximately 6 weeks, oil production is expected to be only modestly impacted. This downtime is incorporated into our 2013 Bakken production guidance, which remains 64,000 to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In terms of individual Bakken well performance, we remain focused on driving superior returns, which is a function of well costs, productivity and price realization. Well costs in the second quarter averaged $8.4 million per well, down 28% from $11.6 million per well in the second quarter of 2012 and down from $8.6 million per well in the first quarter of 2013.","In addition, the productivity of our wells continues to be among the highest in industry as 18 of the top 50 wells, or 36%, in the North Dakota Bakken play since the beginning of 2012 are Hess-operated wells.","During the quarter, we brought 42 operated wells on to production, of which 27 were Middle Bakken and 15 were Three Forks. For the full year, we expect to bring approximately 170 wells on production, with 2\/3 targeting the Middle Bakken and 1\/3 targeting the Three Forks.","We continue to conduct pilot programs to test optimal well spacing. While these tests are ongoing, our current thinking is that core Middle Bakken can be down spaced to approximately 180-acre spacing in many areas. Although we are still early in the testing in the down spacing of our Three Forks acreage, we believe the in-fill potential will be broadly similar to the Middle Bakken.","Our Tioga rail facility ran at capacity in the second quarter, delivering an average of 53,000 barrels per day to higher-value markets. Our Tioga Gas Plant expansion project, which will increase wet gas input capacity from 120 million cubic feet a day to 250 million cubic feet a day, is on schedule for commissioning at the end of 2013, enabling us to capture more liquids and value from our own gas and from third parties.","In summary, we are on track to deliver our 2013 production and capital guidance for the Bakken, and we are increasingly optimistic about the long-term upside.","Turning to the Utica. The appraisal of our acreage continues, and we are increasingly encouraged by well results to date. In the second quarter, 10 wells were drilled, 3 were completed, and 3 were flow tested. Two of the 3 tested wells were operated by Hess. On our 100% owned acreage, the Richland B 1H-34 well in Belmont County tested at a 24-hour rate of 2,985 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 29% liquids.","On our joint venture acreage, we, as operator, tested the Cadiz A 1H-23 well in Harrison County at a 24-hour rate of 2,250 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 57% liquids.","In 2013, Hess and CONSOL expect to spud approximately 40 wells and drill 25 across both our 100% owned and joint venture acreage.","Turning to the second element of our strategy, exploitation. Progress continues at Valhall, Tubular Bells and North Malay Basin. At the BP-operated Valhall Field in Norway, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. The field was shut in for one month during the second quarter due to planned downtime at Ekofisk. Full year 2013 net production from Valhall is forecast by the operator to be in the range of 24,000 to 28,000 barrels of oil per day, which we believe will come in at the lower end of this range. In July, net production has averaged approximately 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Valhall.","At our 57% owned and operated Tubular Bells development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our second production well was drilled during the quarter, and we are currently drilling the third. We are on track for field startup in mid-2014, delivering 25,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day of high-margin Gulf of Mexico production.","At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, the jacket and topsides were installed, and the Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading vessel for the early production system arrived on location in June. In addition, the 5-well development drilling program is underway. We anticipate an on-time start of production in the fourth quarter at a net rate of 40 million cubic feet per day.","With regard to full field development, as a result of an upward revision in net gas sales from 125 million cubic feet a day to 165 million cubic feet a day, additional engineering and construction work will be required, which will push first gas toward year-end 2016.","In terms of exploration, following 7 consecutive discoveries on the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block in Ghana, where Hess has a 90% working interest and is operator, we submitted our appraisal plans to the government in June. We plan to commence appraisal drilling in 2014 and are continuing our pre-development work, including preliminary front-end engineering and design. Consistent with our exploration strategy in August, we plan to open a data room with the intent to farm down our Ghana interest.","In Kurdistan, where Hess has a 64% working interest and is operator of the Shakrok and Dinarta blocks, we will spud the first of 2 planned exploration wells in August and anticipate spudding the second well in the fourth quarter. Here, we also recently opened a data room and plan to bring in partners.","In closing, strong execution performance in the first half of the year means that we are on track to deliver both our short and long-term goals.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2013.","The corporation generated consolidated net income of $1,431,000,000 in the second quarter 2013 compared with $1,276,000,000 in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the corporation had earnings of $520 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $669 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to Exploration and Production. E&P had income of $1,533,000,000 in the second quarter and $1,286,000,000 in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, E&P had income of $600 million in the current quarter and $698 million in the previous quarter.","Second quarter income included a non-taxable gain of $951 million related to the sale of the corporation's 90% interest in its Russian subsidiary, Samara-Nafta. Second quarter 2013 results also included an after-tax charge of $18 million for employee severance and exit costs.","The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted earnings were as follows: lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $165 million; changes in realized selling prices decreased earnings by $40 million; lower cash costs improved earnings by $60 million; lower depreciation, depletion and amortization improved earnings by $55 million. All other items net to a decrease in earnings of $8 million for an overall decrease in second quarter adjusted earnings of $98 million.","Our E&P crude oil operations were over lifted compared with production by approximately 550,000 barrels in the quarter, which increased after-tax income by approximately $30 million. Based on our current crude oil lifting schedule, we expect this over lift to reverse in the third quarter. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was 44% for the second quarter of 2013.","We have provided quarterly operational data for the Bakken in the supplemental earnings presentation posted on our website, including production data, number of rigs, Middle Bakken and Three Forks well counts, average gross 30-day initial production rates, well costs, working interest percentages and acreage totals. The supplemental earnings presentation also includes pro forma E&P results for 2012 and 2013. The pro forma information presents our results as if our asset divestiture program had all been completed effective January 1, 2012, in order to present a historical comparison of the performance for the ongoing portfolio. This pro forma information includes operational data and cash margins.","Turning to Corporate. Corporate expenses after income taxes were $50 million in the second quarter and $44 million in the first quarter of 2013. Corporate expenses are higher than normal in both periods due to severance charges and increased proxy costs and professional fees. After-tax interest expense was $63 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared with $66 million in the first quarter.","Turning to cost savings. As part of our transformation to a pure play E&P company, we are taking steps to realign the organization and reduce costs. During the second quarter of 2013, we continue to reorganize the E&P and Corporate functions to support the new portfolio and announced the closure of our London office by the end of the first quarter of 2014. These initiatives are anticipated to result in annual cost savings of $150 million.","Turning to discontinued operations. Earnings from the downstream businesses were $11 million in the second quarter and $100 million in the first quarter of 2013. Second quarter 2013 results included after-tax charges totaling $21 million for employee severance related to the corporation's planned exit from its downstream businesses and cost to idle refinery equipment at the Port Reading refining facility.","First quarter 2013 results included net after-tax income of $30 million from items affecting comparability. Adjusted earnings decreased for the quarter, principally reflecting seasonally lower natural gas and oil volumes in Energy Marketing, partially offset by higher retail gasoline margins and improved trading results.","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter, including a decrease of $70 million from changes in working capital, was $1,247,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,500,000,000.","Net proceeds from asset sales were $2,291,000,000. Net repayments of debt were $1,688,000,000. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $69 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $281 million.","Turning to our financial position. Earlier this year, we committed to applying the proceeds from our asset sales program to improve our financial flexibility to fund growth and provide current returns to shareholders. More specifically, proceeds from divestitures are to be applied to: repay debt, provide a cash cushion, fund the 2013 cash flow deficit and return cash to shareholders by repurchasing up to $4 billion of shares.","To date, we have used proceeds from divestitures to repay debt, begin to build the cash cushion and fund the cash flow deficit. In the third quarter, the corporation plans to increase its annual dividend. And with the announcement of the sale of our Energy Marketing business, we are in a position to commence our share repurchase program.","We are progressing plans to monetize our Bakken infrastructure assets by 2015 and use the proceeds to return additional cash to shareholders. We had $725 million of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2013, and $642 million at December 31, 2012. Total debt was $5,800,000,000 at June 30, 2013, and $8,111,000,000 at December 31, 2012. And the corporation's debt to capitalization ratio was 19.5% at June 30, 2013, compared with 27.7% at the end of 2012.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Evan Calio, Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Let me start with a strategic question -- strategy question. John, you've reconstituted the board since last earnings call, 10 new and experienced members. The board has met. While you appear to have clear operational momentum, I was just -- could you update us on any broader strategic review occurring? Or any update on the strategic assessment or comments on how the board transition has gone so far?","John B. Hess","Yes. The board transition has gone very well. I would characterize the first board meeting that we had in June as very constructive, and we're totally focused on executing the strategy we've outlined.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's great. And keeping on the asset sale theme, restructuring theme, sale proceeds have exceeded expectations, I think yesterday is included, maybe harder to reconcile from the deconstructed historical EBITDA of the Retail segment. Maybe a few questions that could help. I mean, for -- could you provide a 2012 EBITDA or a cash metric for the Energy Marketing business for the OM?","John P. Rielly","All right, Evan. So obviously, we're in the middle of these processes. Right? So the sale process, and we don't want to front run the process. You saw, I think, in Centrica's release that they had $200 million of estimated EBITDA for 2013. That's a reasonable estimate for the business. Last year, obviously, it was a warmer winter. Right? So it was at least 20% less heating degree days last year. So that obviously would have impacted the EBITDA in 2012 as it related to Energy Marketing, but that's really as far as we're going to go. We're not going to front run the sale process.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Well then, maybe a risk of a -- of getting a similar response on the terminal sales, can you give us any historical utilization rates? Or any metric there because I presume some uptick in potential value will be improved utilizations to a potential buyer.","John P. Rielly","So, Evan, I mean, every buyer is going to look at the business potentially differently from how they want to manage it. So we're not providing that data right now. We are well into the process. Obviously, selling the terminal business in this current environment is a positive thing. It's a very good environment. The assets are strong. We've got a nice set of assets here on the East Coast, and the interest has been keen in these assets. So that's as far as I think we want to go. And just as John said, earlier, the sales progress is well underway and is going according to plan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then maybe lastly if I could. Could you provide any tax basis in assets held, or how much coverage, how much tax coverage you have for those assets that are announced yet haven't yet received -- closed yet?","John P. Rielly","There will be significant gains on the assets on an overall basis to be sold. From a tax leakage guidance standpoint from the overall sale proceeds that we are getting as part of this program, we've talked about that our tax leakage will be less than 5%. That's overall. That's with the E&P businesses and the downstream businesses.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ed Westlake, Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just continuing on that downstream thought process, are there any corporate costs that are in the downstream that would be discontinued if those assets were sold? Just trying to true up historical reporting to what a seller might look at for these assets.","John P. Rielly","There are allocated costs. And for the most part, the Corporate cost, if you want to call it that, are -- assigned to the business units are allocated and are within the segment. Now there's no question, as I said as part of our cost-saving initiative, that we are looking at over all our functions and are going to right size and reorganize the functions for the smaller portfolio that we have. But I would tell you, in general, most of the costs are allocated into the segment.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then switching to the Bakken. Obviously, you've guided that the shift to pad drilling would constrain volumes and that there will be an inflection in the second half. As we look out into 2014, '15, '16, I mean, any sort of feeling at this stage in terms of which of those years will be the faster growth on towards the sort of 120,000 barrel day that you've discussed in the past in terms of the rate of that growth? Any color there would be helpful.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, sure, Ed. So I think that's going to be function of obviously how much capital we put in it. But I think once we get through the gas plant commissioning at the end of this year, I think, for all practical purposes, you assume a relatively steady ramp from there to 120,000 barrels a day over a couple of years.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And initial volume estimates for the Utica, given the well results you've had?","Gregory P. Hill","In terms of what year, Ed?","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Say next year, 2014?","Gregory P. Hill","We haven't finished our plan yet, and we're still in the appraisal phase. So next year will be another appraisal year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions, please. I guess, first, for Greg. Greg, the Three Forks opportunity in the Bakken, when our numbers -- you're going to be pretty much getting into a sort of cash breakeven type of situation and probably within the next 12 to 18 months. What are the plans there as it relates to optimizing the development of that inventory? Should we expect you to step up capital and development in the Bakken or shift capital toward the more aggressive development plan in the Utica? And I've got a couple of follow-ups, please.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Doug. I think, again, we haven't finalized our business plan for next year. I think as we've done in the past, we will put that capital to wherever the best return is. And so obviously, as we appraise and understand the Three Forks, and that's going very well by the way, the Three Forks are actually some of our best wells in the play, we'll allocate capital between the Middle Bakken and Three Forks to drive whatever the highest return is.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But in terms of the absolute rig count and activity level, Greg, as -- I mean, as you get to cash breakeven, are you going to step that up a bit or maintain the current operating plan?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. I think, again, Doug, we're still finalizing our plans for next year and the following year. So too early to kind of be specific on that. But suffice it to say, it'll be an aggressive program for the Bakken.","John B. Hess","I think, Doug, how we think about it conceptually, and Greg and I were up in North Dakota a couple of weeks ago, our team is doing an outstanding job and our hat's off to them really working on capital efficiency, is Greg in his remarks talked about down spacing. And also, less of our money going forward is going to be for infrastructure. So there'll be more money for drilling. So we're really coming forward now with optimizing our investment program for next year and the year after. And as we get that defined, obviously, we'll be able to share it with you.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups, please. John, latest thoughts on a potential -- I guess I was going to say restructuring, but that's not the right word. A potential MLP of the midstream business led by Tioga?","John P. Rielly","Sure. So as I mentioned, Doug, we are on track. By 2015, we'll be -- we are going to be looking at monetizing that Bakken infrastructure. And obviously, an MLP is a potential key strategy for doing that. We are -- the big key to this, as Greg had mentioned, is to complete the Tioga Gas Plant. So we have all hands on deck to complete that expansion at the end of this year. What we're looking to do is then, as we start 2014, to begin to break out the midstream segment. So to be able to start reporting kind of EBITDA as we see going forward and how the midstream segment would operate, with the goal again of being ready in 2015 to be able to monetize or have an MLP in place for the Bakken assets.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. But, John, an outright sale as opposed to an MLP, is that possible given that -- I mean, MLPs need growth, and if you don't have a lot of drop downs, would a potential trade sale be on the table as well or not?","John P. Rielly","Well, first of all, we'll look at all options, but it doesn't appear that, that would be the case, Doug and why we see good growth in that midstream asset. So one, we've got several types of assets that can be put into it, in the Bakken. One is the rail terminal aspect. So you can always start with a drop down of pieces of it. So you have the rail terminal, you have all the gathering facilities that are in place and then you have the gas plant. And so we view, one, that there's great growth in this business; and two, we want to maintain control because control is critical for us, as you would ask before, about us ramping up our production in the Bakken. And with the production growth coming through that, obviously, drive some growth. And as we move forward, we have other potential assets in our portfolio that can be included in the midstream and also will drive growth. So we see some good growth there, and it looks like it can provide very good value for our shareholders.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Last one for me, maybe to John Hess. John, it looks like you're going to do substantially better than the disposal proceeds, and a lot of people I think expect it. What's the chances of upsizing the buyback? And what is the mechanism of implementing the buyback? And I'll leave it there.","John B. Hess","I'm going to let John Rielly answer the buyback question.","John P. Rielly","So where we are right now, Doug, from a planning standpoint, I could talk at a high level, as John mentioned earlier, we're in a position to begin repurchasing the shares under our $4 billion authorization. So we have an authorization up to $4 billion. We expect the repurchases to be spread fairly consistently over time. And as a result, we will incur short-term debt periodically as we purchase shares in advance of receiving divestiture proceeds. So just to -- as part of that, any such debt we incur will be paid off with subsequent sale proceeds like the Energy Marketing transaction that we have. And then we'll keep you informed of our progress with the plan on future quarterly conference calls. It's just early to say anything more with that as far as our share repurchase plan.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Sankey, Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could I just follow-up straightaway on the buyback versus debt-type question? Do you have a target, a notional longer-term target for leverage now? I know in the past you've given one.","John P. Rielly","The way we're looking right now. As you saw, we're under 20% of our debt cap. And our portfolio as we see going forward, as John had mentioned, in 2014, we've always referred to that as type of -- the tipping point with our portfolio, where free cash flow will approach our capital spend. And post 2014, our portfolio can deliver this 5% to 8% growth that we have targeted with our cash flow from operations. So from that standpoint, we don't have to increase debt. So there's no increase in leverage planned from that standpoint. And again, with the share repurchases, again, we are funding that with our proceeds from asset sales. So we're very comfortable that we will have a very strong balance sheet. And obviously, from that standpoint, we're not looking to lever up going forward but we'd be in a position if their commodity prices decrease, that our balance sheet would be able to handle any cash flow deficits that could occur from that standpoint. So we like our leverage where it is.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the announcement of the Bakken monetization of the midstream, is there any implication there for the spin of the entire Bakken that was mooted? Are the board -- is the board considering that spin now?","John B. Hess","Obviously, the board will consider all moves to maximize shareholder value. But the plan we've outlined as a pure play E&P, having both the onshore and offshore business, we think, is the best way to maximize value. And the best way we're going to do that is to focus on the execution of the plan that we've outlined already.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Okay. So to be very clear, I think that the announcements of the MLP doesn't have any implications for any potential or not, spin of the Bakken.","John B. Hess","Not at all. And to reemphasize John Rielly's point, it's very important that, regardless of the financial structure that we move forward with our infrastructure in the Bakken, it could be an MLP, it could be a joint venture. Hess will continue to control and operate that infrastructure. That's essential for our future production and controlling that and accessing the markets as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Robert Kessler, Tudor, Pickering and Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see if you wouldn't mind quantifying the degree to which you generate RIN in your -- I assume your terminal business or retail as the case may be?","John P. Rielly","Sure. I mean, we are in a position that we are benefiting from the current RIN environment. Now just to point out, Hess does remain an obligated party for RINs because we do import transportation fuel to meet marketing's gasoline demand. But our retail and terminal networks do generate more renewable credits than required to meet our supply needs. In the second quarter, our excess RINs generated a $17-million after-tax benefit. So that's what it was in the second quarter. If you're looking at the third quarter, I would tell you, we're generating RINs around $20 million a month of excess RINs. So if you were to take the current pricing that's in place right now and just say you sold all the RINs at that price for the third quarter, you could expect us to record an after-tax benefit in the $35 million to $40 million. Now, again, that's additional, so that would be in the second quarter with the $17 million already been recorded in the first quarter. Now, however, I have to add this -- and it's not quantifiable. But the cost of RINs rising in recent months has led to some RIN sharing, I'll call it, at the wholesale level, which is reducing our retail fuel margins and offsetting some of the direct benefit from selling the excess RINs.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Now how do you think about this as it relates to marketing the assets? I mean, presumably different buyers might have different interests as far as how much value they attribute to their RIN integration. Are you considering different options as far as whether it's packaged with the terminals or retail or sold independent of the other 2 pieces?","John B. Hess","Yes. Each one of our businesses, the terminal business and the retail business, will be divested separately to maximize value. Processes for those, as well as Indonesia, Thailand and our trading business are underway. Obviously, it's premature to share any details, but we're going to obviously pursue all alternatives to maximize value.","John P. Rielly","If you don't mind, I just want to make sure I clarify this point out. When I said the $35 million to $40 million, that would be a third quarter benefit. I guess I had said second quarter. So that's a third quarter, and the RINs generate a $17 million after-tax benefit in the second quarter. So just to make sure I got that right.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then separately from me, the Bakken rail dynamics and pipe dynamics out of the basin have shifted quite a bit in recent weeks. I'm wondering what you might be seeing so far in the third quarter as it relates to your movement of third-party volumes by rail versus by pipe.","John B. Hess","Right. Through the second quarter, we have been maximizing our rail shipments between 53,000 and 55,000 barrels a day out of Tioga. In July, as you rightfully point out, the market dynamics shifted where the WTI\/Brent spread started to narrow, and it even narrowed more in August. As a consequence, because we have 3 alternatives to maximize our net backs of our crude in North Dakota, one is supplying local refinery, another is accessing pipeline Enbridge for the mid-continent, and the third is our rail. We were in a position to maximize value by moving approximately 4,500 barrels a day in July to pipeline markets and up that number to 12,000 barrels a day to pipeline markets in August. Right now, where the differentials are looking forward, the rail is actually more attractive again. And remember, the rail doesn't just go to St. James. It also goes to the East Coast and West Coast. So we're in a unique position to capture the highest value wherever the market offers it, and we continue to do so.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Arjun Murti, Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. I think, John, you mentioned the pro forma x asset sales number for 2013. Is the 2014 number still the 3 25 [ph] to 3 40 [ph]I think you'd previously articulated?","John P. Rielly","Yes. There's no change in our guidance. Our guidance was that our pro forma production in 2012 was 289,000 barrels a day. And then by 2014, we would have aggregate mid-teens growth there, and there's no change in that. And again, the growth driven by Bakken, Valhall and Tubular Bells coming online.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And just one follow-up on the Bakken. I think in part, the lower-cost savings comes from a different completion methodology. It looks like the IPs are still doing quite well. I don't know, Greg, if there's any additional color on how you're feeling about overall EURs or what they might be with the changing completion methodology?","Gregory P. Hill","Sorry, I didn't have my mic on. Yes, I think the EURs are within the range that we've discussed previously. We're a little bit at the higher end of the range in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Completion costs continued to come down this quarter. That was due to efficiency as a result of pad drilling, as well as some pricing concessions that we got some frac contracts.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Baber, Simmons & Company.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Just one quick one from me, but I was just hoping you could address some of the planned maintenance at Valhall in a little bit more detail? Because I didn't recall any maintenance there being telegraphed at the time of the last call, and obviously, that asset has had some significant downtime since the second half of last year. But was that strictly related to the Ekofisk shutdown? Or was there anything specific you had to address there at Valhall? Just hoping for a little bit more detail there. And then if you could just confirm your confidence in the longer-term targets there as well.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So on the first thing, no. This was all just planned maintenance at Ekofisk. So Valhall was taken down for a month, and I do believe that we telegraphed that earlier, that, that was an upcoming maintenance event in the second quarter. I think over the long haul, our strategy is the same. Just work with the operator, BP, to get that facility as maximum capacity as possible. And we are at -- in July, we're back up around 26,000 barrels a day on Valhall.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Malone, Mizuho Securities.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","So one question on Ghana and on Kurdistan. You said the data rooms will be open, if not now, it will be open shortly. Do you expect to get partners in there before the end of 2013? And can you kind of give a range of what your ideal routine working interest would be in both of those assets?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, I think as we've said before, part of our exploration strategy is to reduce our higher working interest opportunity set. So -- and as we said before, it's going to be case-by-case. But this kind of 40% kind of a working interest would be our ideal sweet spot. Regarding timing, again, the data rooms have -- in Kurdistan have just opened. Obviously, we would like to get a partner as soon as possible in Kurdistan because we'll start drilling in August. And then on Ghana, the data room hasn't opened yet but will open imminently. And clearly, we'd like to get a partner in there as soon as possible as well. So...","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And then just getting back to the Bakken for a second. It looks like in this quarter you had to do a higher proportion of gas and production. Is that a trend that ought to continue? And how does the Tioga refit influence that higher proportion of gas?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, I think with time, as the Tioga Gas Plant comes on, you will end up with a little bit higher proportion of gas in your stream. But it won't be a significant major shift.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the proportion we're at now, I think, will go up a little bit from the proportion of gas in Q...","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Yes. Go up slightly. Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Cheng, Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Greg, earlier, talking about the farm down on Ghana and Kurdistan, what is the primary consideration when you consider that weather is going to come in? Is it a financial consideration? Or is that -- more importantly, is on the other strategic indication that may represent?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. I think there's 2 -- there's 2 drivers. I think on Ghana, obviously, the main driver there is reduce some financial exposure, right, for Ghana. And then for Kurdistan, it's the same, reduce some financial exposure, but also reduce risk. This -- Paul, if you recall, this is part of our overall exploration strategy to reduce working interest in order to allow us to get more drill bit exposure for the same investment. So obviously, if I'm 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3, I can drill 3x as many wells as if I'm 100%.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. Totally agree. I just want to see that -- I mean, is the most important -- in terms of who going to win the bid, is it based on how much they pay you? Or there is other factor is more important? I guess that's my question.","Gregory P. Hill","I think there's other -- yes, I think there's other factors. I mean, obviously, price will be a key consideration. But if you think about Ghana, we would obviously look at the technical capability of the partner as well as being an important consideration in that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But will you be looking at that -- sort of like a swapping asset in the case of Ghana? Or that's not really the preferred route?","Gregory P. Hill","That's not really the preferred route.","John B. Hess","It's getting someone with a financial capability to help us reduce risk and maximize value for the risk we will be taking. So I would say the economic concerns would be the primary one.","Gregory P. Hill","Right.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And John Rielly earlier, based on the way that you talk about the buyback, have you already started the buyback? Or that you are still waiting for the Energy Marketing deal to be closed before you start?","John P. Rielly","We have not started the buyback, so just to be clear on that. And then to your question, no, we're in a position now that we expect our repurchases to be spread over time. And as I said, we can incur debt here periodically because we will be buying shares back prior to receiving divestiture proceeds. So we won't be waiting for the Energy Marketing proceeds.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But will you start the buyback, say, in the third quarter? Or that is going to be later?","John P. Rielly","So I mean -- we want to keep this at a high level from a planning standpoint. So we clearly -- as with the Energy Marketing sale, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter, we will be buying ahead of that. So yes, we do expect to start in the third quarter, but I don't want to say anything more than that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And John, when you -- earlier, that you're talking about the potential tax leakage on the asset sales would be less than 5%, is that also based on the assumption that you're going to sell the retail and not a tax-based spin-off?","John P. Rielly","So from an overall standpoint, right, we're on dual track on the retail. But from -- either way, if we're looking at that from a overall asset sale proceeds, including E&P, yes, we still say it will be less than 5% of the overall proceeds.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So even if you're going to sell retail, not tax-based spin-off, you'll still be less than 5% do you believe?","John B. Hess","I think the key point there, Paul, is we are going to pursue all alternatives to maximize value for retail, and it's just premature to share any details further than that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Greg, on Utica, on the liquid [ph], can you tell us what is the liquid [ph]? Is this C3, C4, C5, C6? I mean, what kind of component are we talking about?","Gregory P. Hill","Sorry, I had to -- sorry, I had to turn my mic on and I apologize for that. It's -- for the majority of the wells that we've tested so far, so the ones in second quarter, the one that I quoted of 2,250 barrel equivalents per day, that's got about 360 barrels of condensate in it. So -- and some NGLs. So of that 2,250, 57% is liquids on an all-in basis. So really, Paul, it really just depends on where you are in this play. We're still delineating all of those lines. Where is the condensate? Where is NGLs? Where is dry gas? And so it's a mixed bag right now.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So you're still not seeing an established pattern based on the well that you test in terms of this split between condensate and NGL?","Gregory P. Hill","We just don't have enough well data yet. Just keep in mind, as far as tests, since 2012, we only have 12 or 13 wells that we've tested. So it's still very early, and we're trying to appraise all those various windows as industry is doing as well.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that -- Greg, when we're talking about Bakken, you had debt target of 120,000-barrel per day back, I think, in 2000 -- maybe in late 2009, 2010, early? And that target, is that already -- you incorporate your potential in Three Forks or just on the Middle Bakken?","Gregory P. Hill","No. I think we -- either\/or, I guess, is how I would answer that. It's mainly going to be a function of how much capital you put in and how fast you ramp it up. Because we will interchange Three Forks and Middle Bakken wells as necessary, again, trying to go where the highest return is. So [indiscernible].","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, I understand. Just saying that in terms of the resource potential, can -- including the Three Forks and the Middle Bakken, can they support even bigger than 120,000? I guess that's my question. Or the resources really can only support 120,000?","Gregory P. Hill","No, no, no. They could definitely support a higher peak rate. And again, it's just going to be a function of how much capital you put into the Bakken on an annual basis. Right? [indiscernible] the resource is there.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two final questions. One, John, do you have a number that, in terms of what is the unit operating costs at Bakken in the second quarter and in terms of the cash operating cost and including the transportation cost? And second one, just want to confirm, you said that you generate about 20 million gallons a month in the excess RIN. I just want to confirm that number.","John P. Rielly","So, yes, Paul. It's 20 million a month of excess RINs that we generate per month. And then as far as the Bakken unit costs, in general, our guidance has been -- is that our operating cash costs, including production taxes, are a bit below our portfolio average that we have for the overall portfolio. And our unit DD&A costs, including all the infrastructure-related costs associated with it, are higher than our portfolio average. And we do anticipate, and it has been happening, that our unit cash costs will decline as volumes increase and that the unit DD&A will also decrease going forward as a result of increasing the reserve bookings relative to investment. And also, as John mentioned earlier, decreasing infrastructure spend.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. Just a request, if possible, that in your supplemental data, that it's great that you put all those information on Bakken, if you can also add on the operating cost and the DD&A, that would be really helpful.","John P. Rielly","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Pavel Molchanov, Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","You referenced the appraisal plan in Ghana. Any sense of the timetable for getting approval on that? And any particular conditions or -- that you're concerned about?","John B. Hess","Greg and I were in Ghana. I met with the top government officials in June, got a very warm reception and encouragement, and the ball is in their court to tell us when they will approve the appraisal program. But I would say the signs are encouraging, as well as the signs for us bringing in a partner or partners. So we have a very good relationship there, and the ball is in their court. And when we have something to report, we will tell you.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And regardless of when you get approval, what's the anticipated timetable for bringing Ghana onto production?","Gregory P. Hill","So I think -- so just the timetable, would be -- once we get approval of the appraisal plan, then the clock runs for 2 years for that appraisal period. Obviously, in parallel, we're doing pre-FEED studies. So the soonest that you would be able to sanction the project would be at the end of that 2-year appraisal program. Then you have to submit a development plan to the government and go through the approval process there. So the soonest you would be able to submit that plan would be at the end of the appraisal program.","John B. Hess","As we pointed out before, it doesn't factor in -- assuming the investment would be attractive returns versus other opportunities we have, it doesn't factor in our 5-year production forecast. It's beyond that. So it's beyond 2017.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Herrlin, Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Just a couple of quick ones for me. Greg, you didn't mention the China shale JV? Is there anything you can talk about with that?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, sure. We signed -- I was in China last week and signed a PSC for -- which covers about 200,000 gross acres in the Santanghu Basin in the northwest part of China. It's a phased program. And under this contract, we're going to invest about $25 million over 2 years to drill 2 vertical wells and one horizontal sidetrack. So a very small amount of money to kind of do a proof-of-concept.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Any kind of update on Pony? Or still working on that?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. No, I think the partners are working towards a sanction pack. Early 2014 would be when we would anticipate a sanction decision.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Regarding partnering with both Kurdistan and Ghana, are you looking for a carry or a heads-up deal? Or promote, basically?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Obviously, we're looking for some form of carry.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. And last one from me. For the new slim-fasted Hess, approximately what will be ballpark on the headcount? Because obviously, you have a lot of people in retail. I was just curious.","John B. Hess","Well, obviously, the retail would be out of the headcount. The exact type of numbers, we're working on and finalizing and not in a position to give you the final details on it yet, but it will be a significantly slimmer headcount because we're just going to be a pure play E&P, and we'll be right-sized to support that.","Operator","And at this time, ladies and gentlemen, as there are no further questions in the queue, this will conclude the second quarter 2013 Hess Corporation earnings conference call.

My name is Allison, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. And I'd now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Allison. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay, and thank you to everyone for joining our fourth quarter conference call. Greg Hill and John Rielly are also here today. And after some prepared remarks, as usual, we will take your questions.","Over the last several months, I have met with many of you in person to share our enthusiasm about the prospects for our company in 2014 and beyond. This coming year will be one in which the company and its shareholders will continue to benefit from execution around our focused portfolio of lower-risk, higher-growth assets.","We are confident that our initiatives have successfully positioned the company to achieve 5% to 8% compound average annual production growth through 2017 from 2012 pro forma. Importantly, we have the financial flexibility to fund this long-term cash-generative growth, while also delivering strong, sustainable returns for our shareholders.","Before I expand on 2014, let me recap some key headlines from our earnings release and summarize our major accomplishments from 2013. First, 2013 adjusted earnings were $1.9 billion and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $5.55 billion.","Compared to 2012, our results were positively impacted by higher realized selling prices, which offset lower production that was largely as a result of asset sales and the shut-in of Libyan production.","Second, in 2013, production averaged 336,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a pro forma basis, excluding divestitures and Libya. In 2014, we forecast production to average between 305,000 and 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.","Third, in 2013, we replaced 118% of production at an FD&A cost of approximately $41.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. At year end, our proved reserves stood at 1.437 billion barrels of oil equivalent and our reserve life was 11.5 years.","On a pro forma basis, our 2013 reserve replacement ratio would have been 148% and our FD&A cost would have been $36 per barrel of oil equivalent. Pro forma year end reserves were 1.362 billion barrels of oil equivalent and our reserve life was 12.8 years.","Now let's turn to the Bakken. Last year was an especially important one for us, as we really began to capitalize on our position as one of the 2 largest oil and gas producers in the play. Net production averaged 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 20% year-over-year. And as Greg will discuss in more detail, we increased production while simultaneously lowering drilling and completion costs to $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to $9 million in the year-ago quarter.","To put this in perspective, we achieved this production increase even though we transitioned to pad drilling and experienced required shut-ins as a result of the expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant. Since the start of 2012, 1\/3 of the top 50 wells drilled in the Bakken in North Dakota, in terms of 90-day initial production rate, were operated by Hess. We have an outstanding team operating in the Bakken, and they're doing all the right things to capture the tremendous investment opportunity there as we continue to drive down well costs, increase production and maximize returns.","Turning to our other accomplishments in 2013. As everyone knows, we announced in March a detailed plan to: one, complete our transformation into a pure-play E&P company with increased production visibility and lower risk; two, fully exit the downstream; three, strengthen financial flexibility to fund growth; and four, increase current returns to shareholders.","By any measure, our progress has been remarkable. Specifically, with respect to our announced divestiture program, we generated $7.8 billion in total proceeds from asset sales completed and announced in 2013. Consistent with our March announcement, initial proceeds were used to pay down $2.4 billion of short-term debt, fund a cash flow deficit over $1 billion in 2013 and to add approximately $1 billion of cash to the balance sheet as a cushion against future commodity price volatility.","Excess proceeds from our asset sales allowed us to begin a share repurchase program in August of up to $4 billion. To date, we have purchased $1.9 billion of our stock, reducing fully diluted outstanding shares by approximately 6.5%. This share repurchase program is ongoing. We also raised our annual dividend by 150% to $1 per share in September.","With respect to those divestitures still in progress, in terms of Hess Retail, late last year, we received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS permitting Hess Corporation to spin the Hess Retail tax free to its shareholders. On January 8, Hess filed a Form 10 with the SEC in anticipation of completing the spin in mid-2014. A parallel third-party sales process has also been initiated and is currently ongoing to determine which alternative maximizes value for shareholders.","In addition, the sale of our Thailand assets is well advanced, and we expect to be able to make an announcement early this year. The divestment of our interest in our energy trading joint venture, Hetco, is also ongoing, and we anticipate the conclusion of this process later in 2014.","Additionally, we are working aggressively to structure our Bakken midstream assets in a way that would allow monetization without the loss of operating control, most likely through an MLP vehicle. We expect this event to occur no later than 2015, and we'll give further updates as appropriate.","Looking to 2014 and beyond, as I have already noted, we are well positioned to achieve these 2 goals: First, deliver compound average annual production growth of 5% to 8% from pro forma 2012 over a 5-year period; and second, be free cash flow positive post-2014 based on $100 Brent.","Our high visibility production growth is underpinned in the near term by assets with relatively low execution risk, by the highest leverage to oil prices in our peer group and by industry-leading cash margins. These assets include the Bakken in North Dakota, Tubular Bells in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Valhall in Norway.","In the outer years, we will benefit from our exciting North Malay Basin project in Malaysia and the emerging Utica Shale play in Ohio.","I have already talked a little bit about the Bakken, but it bears repeating. Hess is one of the 2 largest oil and gas producers with some of the best acreage in arguably the best shale oil play in the world. Our wells there are among the lowest cost and most productive in the region; and as a result, are generating some of the highest rates of return.","In 2014, we plan to increase our rig count to 17 from 14 and expect net production from the Bakken to average between 80,000 and 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Based upon the strong production performance of our Bakken and Three Forks wells over the past year, we are increasing our production guidance to a peak of net 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018 from our prior guidance of net 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.","In addition, we are increasing the number of future well locations from 1,800 to 2,400 and also our estimate of recoverable resources from 1 billion to 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. During 2014, we will also be running production tests using tighter spacing pilots. This will allow us to determine whether there is additional upside in our estimates for future production and resources. Greg will talk more about this later.","Turning to the offshore. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are advancing our Tubular Bells project with our partner, Chevron. Hess has a 57% interest in the project and is the operator. Production is planned to commence in the third quarter of 2014 at a net rate of 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Recent drilling results are encouraging and indicate potential upside in both production and reserves.","Moving to Norway. The Valhall Field is a long life material resource that generates significant free cash flow, and we think it still has untapped potential in terms of unbooked resources and production growth. The redevelopment project that was completed early last year extended field life by 40 years, and the operator plans to bring 3 new wells online this year.","For 2014, we forecast net production to average between 3 -- 30,000 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase from 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013, while we continue to work closely with the operator to maximize production.","Greg and I were in Malaysia earlier this month, and we are very enthusiastic about the long-term potential of our position in the Gulf of Thailand. Our natural gas assets there are long life, low risk and low cost, with oil-linked pricing and exploratory upside and will be significant cash generators for the next 2 decades.","Combining our expected North Malay Basin production with that already coming from the JDA, we anticipate that by 2017 our Gulf of Thailand assets will produce an average of approximately 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the next 2 decades compared to 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013.","Coming back to U.S. onshore. There's also considerable promise in the emerging Utica Shale where we have concentrated our position in the sweet spot of the play and have a successful joint venture with CONSOL. We drilled 29 wells last year and expect to drill another 35 wells in 2014.","We are encouraged by the potential of our holdings in the wet gas window and anticipate returns comparable to those that we see in the Bakken, in part due to our acreage having high net revenue interest. As you have likely seen, we announced about a half hour ago, the sale of approximately 74,000 acres of our Utica dry -- Utica Shale dry gas acreage to an undisclosed third party for $924 million.","Total proceeds from the sale will be used for additional share repurchases as they are in excess of those associated with a divestiture program announced by the company on March 4 of last year. We will determine whether or not to seek an increase to our existing $4 billion share repurchase authorization, which was approved as part of our March 4 announcement after a final decision is made, either to spin or sell Hess Retail. John Rielly will provide more detail in a few minutes.","This divestiture is a perfect example of a point I have made many times before. Portfolio reshaping is part of the ongoing nature of the oil and gas business and fundamental to our strategy for growing long-term shareholder value.","In this case, while our wells in the dry gas portion of the Utica were highly productive, we concluded that the potential returns from such an investment at current and projected natural gas prices no longer justified retaining this acreage as a strategic part of our overall liquids based asset portfolio.","In summary, we are doing what we set out to do and more, as we continue to transform Hess into a pure-play E&P company. I am immensely proud of each and every member of our team for their combined contributions to our tremendous progress. I also want to thank our Board of Directors for their engaged counsel and their unanimous support of our strategy.","The bottom line: 2013 was an outstanding year for our company and our shareholders. We look forward to carrying this momentum in 2014 to drive growth, enhance returns and create long-term value for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill.","Gregory P. Hill","Thanks, John. I would like to provide an operational update on our progress in 2013 and the plan for 2014.","Starting with production. In the fourth quarter, we averaged 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This included the shut-in of some 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of Hess production in the Gulf of Mexico as a consequence of Shell's unplanned shutdown of its Auger pipeline for repair on December 18. Production was restored on January 10.","Overall, in 2013, we achieved an average of 336,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Looking forward, in 2014, we forecast production to average between 305,000 and 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which, as John mentioned, assumes our Libya production which has net capacity of approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, remains shut in for the full year as a result of civil unrest.","We forecast production in the first quarter of 2014 to average between 275,000 and 285,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting both the previously mentioned unplanned downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and the planned downtime associated with the Tioga Gas Plant expansion in North Dakota. Beginning in the second quarter, production is expected to build throughout 2014 as a result of the Tioga Gas Plant expansion, steady production growth in the Bakken and the startup of the Tubular Bells field in the third quarter.","Moving to the Bakken. Fourth quarter 2013 production averaged 68,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And as John mentioned, full year 2013 production averaged 67,000 barrels per day, well within our guidance range of 64,000 to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In 2014, net production from the Bakken is expected to increase to between 80,000 and 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net production is expected to average in the range of 65,000 to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2014, reflecting the previously announced downtime associated with the expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant. Once the plant is fully onstream, we expect production to be reestablished at more than 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and thereafter, steadily ramp up throughout the balance of the year.","Looking forward, we now see Bakken production increasing to 125,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and then to 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018. This increase is based on continued strong well performance in both the Middle Bakken and Three Forks, as well as the success of our development spacing based on 5 Middle Bakken wells and 4 Three Forks wells per 1,280 acre drilling spacing unit, or DSU.","As we mentioned on our last quarterly call, we intend to construct 17 well pads that will test infilling down to 7 Middle Bakken wells and 6 Three Forks wells per DSU. In addition, we are also constructing 2 well pads that will test infill down to 9 wells in the Middle Bakken and 8 in the Three Forks per DSU.","If this tighter spacing validates the results of our reservoir simulations, our longer-term guidance of 150,000 barrels per day, our number of economic drilling locations and our recoverable resource will likely increase.","In summary, the Bakken has gotten bigger and better as we have continued to delineate our acreage and optimize our development.","Our continued focus on applying lean manufacturing practices to our operations enabled us to drive our drilling and completion costs down by more than 15% over the course of last year from $9 million per well in the fourth quarter of 2012 to $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Even though we plan to increase our number of frac stages from 30 to 35 in 2014, we believe we can still achieve further reductions in drilling and completion costs in 2014. Our 2014 capital budget for the Bakken is $2.2 billion, which is level with last year.","As John mentioned, although spending is expected to be comparable to 2013, as a result of lower infrastructure spend and continued reduction in drilling and completion costs, our activity level in terms of rig count and wells will be much higher. We expect to operate a 17-rig program in 2014, up from 14 last year; and to bring 225 new wells online compared to 168 last year.","Current plans are to increase the rig count to 20 for mid-2015 forward. However, the results of the tighter spacing drilling in 2014 may result in even higher long-term rig counts.","Our 30-day initial production rates have averaged between 750 to 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day or approximately 15% to 20% above the industry average. Our estimate of the ultimate recovery per well remains between 550,000 and 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent, demonstrating further the high quality of our Bakken acreage.","With regard to our Bakken infrastructure, unseasonably cold weather conditions caused the startup of our Tioga Gas Plant to slip by about 1 month. The plant is 100% mechanically complete, and we are now in the process of commissioning the plant and expect to commence gas sales late February and extraction and sale of natural gas liquids in March.","Turning to the Utica. Our 2013 activities materially improved our understanding of the play. During 2013, we drilled a total of 29 wells, completed 24 and tested 17 across the corporation's 100% owned and JV acreage with CONSOL. We are very encouraged by well results to date, with rates in the wet gas window averaging over 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 47% liquids based on 24-hour tests.","As we announced today, we sold 74,000 acres of dry gas window that did not meet our investment return thresholds. We are fully retaining our 42,000 acre net position in the wet gas window, and we'll focus our efforts there going forward. This acreage provides for strong returns on investment comparable to those of the Bakken, as a consequence of strong liquids-rich well rates and an average net revenue interest of 96%.","Of our 2014 Utica budget of $550 million, some $320 million is dedicated to drilling and completing 32 wells in the wet gas window. A further $50 million is allocated to drill 4 wells in the dry gas window as per our agreement with a third party in order to hold acreage. The balance includes capital for acreage acquisition to build out our DSUs and preconstruction of well facilities and pads in preparation for 2015 drilling.","Drilling and completion costs in the Utica are down some 35% in 2013 versus 2012, as we have begun to apply the same lean manufacturing approaches that we used in the Bakken. However, we are still very much in the appraisal phase in the Utica, and our current drilling and completion cost of approximately $12 million includes extensive logging and coring, which is providing the data required to optimize the ultimate development of our acreage. As we move into development mode, we expect drilling and completion costs will be substantially reduced.","In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we continue to advance our Tubular Bells project, which Hess has a 50% interest and is the operator. The hole is complete, and we expect sail away within the next several weeks as soon as the heavy lift vessel is available after completing work for another operator in the Gulf.","The topsides are now 95% complete, and sail away is planned for late February. Based on the better-than-prognosed results from the first 3 producing wells, a fourth producer will be drilled and completed by early 2015. First production is on schedule for the third quarter of 2014 in a net rate of approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Moving to the Valhall Field in Norway, in which Hess has a 64% interest. The field's redevelopment project was completed in the first quarter of last year. Net production averaged 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2013.","In 2014, we expect Valhall net production to average between 30,000 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and to reach 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2017. The majority of the activities going forward at Valhall will focus on development drilling to fully utilize platform capacity and also implementation of a plan agreed with the operator, BP, to improve operating performance at the field.","In the Gulf of Thailand, we commenced production in October 2013 at the North Malay Basin project, in which Hess has a 50% interest and is the operator. Deliverability from the 5 early production wells is fully on target, and we expect net production to average approximately 40 million cubic feet per day through 2016.","Full field development is progressing according to an aggressive schedule for first gas in late 2016, resulting in net production increasing to 165 million cubic feet per day in 2017 and contributing material cash flow through to the end of the current production-sharing contract in 2033. Early evidence from new 3D seismic shot in 2013 indicates significant volumetric upside. We plan to start a 6-well exploration campaign in late 2014 to further assess this potential.","Regarding exploration, in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points South Block in Ghana, where Hess has a 90% working interest and is the operator, we have received the necessary approvals to begin a 3-well appraisal drilling program in the second half of 2014. Partnering negotiations to reduce our financial exposure are well advanced.","In Kurdistan, our first exploration well, Shakrok-1, has drilled through its Jurassic target and an extensive set of well logging runs and coring has been completed. It will now be drilled on through the Triassic to its target depth after which, we intend to conduct production testing. In addition, we plan to spud a well on the Dinarta block in March. Hess has an 80% paying interest, 64% working interest in these blocks and is the operator.","In closing, 2013 was a year of exceptional execution and delivery on all fronts, which is a tribute to the outstanding people of Hess. 2014 promises to be an exciting year with significant new volume growth in the Bakken and Tubular Bells and delineating material resource potential in North Malay Basin, Ghana and Kurdistan.","I will now hand the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thanks, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2013.","The corporation generated consolidated net income of $1,925,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with $420 million in the third quarter of 2013. Adjusted earnings, which exclude items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, were $319 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $405 million in the previous quarter.","As Greg previously mentioned, subsequent to our interim update, a third-party operated pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico was shut down on December 18, which reduced our production and impacted fourth quarter net income by an estimated $20 million.","Turning to Exploration and Production. E&P income in the fourth quarter of 2013 was $1,029,000,000 and $455 million in the third quarter. E&P adjusted earnings were $436 million in the fourth quarter and $458 million in the previous quarter.","Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were impacted by unplanned maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico in October and December, the planned shutdown of the Tioga Gas Plant and lower realized U.S. crude oil prices.","The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted earnings for E&P between the third and fourth quarter were as follows: Changes in realized selling prices decreased earnings by $34 million. Higher unit costs decreased earnings by $25 million. Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $25 million. All other items net to an increase in earnings of $12 million, for an overall decrease in fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $22 million.","Our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 500,000 barrels of crude oil in the fourth quarter, resulting in increased after-tax income of approximately $8 million. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, was 38% for the fourth quarter and 45% in the third quarter of 2013. The lower rate in the fourth quarter reflects the impact of shut-in Libyan production, which has a high effective tax rate.","In December, Denmark enacted a new hydrocarbon tax law that has resulted in a combination of changes to tax rates, revisions to the amount of uplifts allowed on capital expenditures and special transition rules. These changes will result in a higher effective tax rate, but cash taxes for this hydrocarbon tax are deferred until 2018, due to the uplifts allowed on future capital expenditures and the existence of net operating loss carryforwards. As a consequence of the tax law change, the corporation recorded a deferred tax asset of $674 million.","In addition, the Exploration and Production results for the fourth quarter included the following additional items affecting comparability of earnings: The sales of our Indonesian assets increased net income by $156 million. The write-off of previously capitalized exploration wells in Area 54 offshore Libya decreased net income by $163 million. The write-off of our leasehold acreage in the Marcellus decreased net income by $23 million. Employee severance and other exit costs, including an income tax charge relating to the repatriation of foreign earnings, reduced net income by $51 million.","Turning to corporate and interest. Corporate and interest expenses after income taxes were $115 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $89 million in the third quarter. Adjusted corporate and interest expenses were $108 million in the fourth quarter and $84 million in the previous quarter. The increased costs in the fourth quarter were a result of higher professional fees, increased letter of credit and bank fees and lower capitalized interest.","Turning to downstream. Earnings from the downstream businesses were $1,011,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with $54 million in the third quarter. Fourth quarter results included after-tax gains totaling $995 million related to the sales of our Energy Marketing and terminal network businesses.","Fourth quarter results also included after-tax income of $134 million from the partial liquidation of LIFO inventories, partly offset by after-tax charges totaling $109 million for severance and other exit costs, including an income tax adjustment.","We had an adjusted loss of $9 million in the fourth quarter compared to adjusted earnings of $31 million in the third quarter. The decrease in the fourth quarter earnings was primarily due to the wind down of operations associated with divesting our downstream businesses. You may have seen in our earnings release that we have reported retail marketing and our energy trading joint venture as part of continuing operations, which is due to the potential spin-off of retail marketing and the lengthy marketing processes. These businesses will be reclassified as discontinued operations when they are divested.","As a reminder, we have included pro forma E&P results in our supplemental earnings presentation on our website to assist in your understanding of our results as a pure-play E&P company.","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter, including an increase of $389 million from changes in working capital, was $1,550,000,000. Net proceeds from asset sales were $2,870,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,421,000,000. Common stock acquired and retired amounted to $993 million. Net repayments of debt were $416 million. Common stock dividends paid were $81 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $16 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $1,493,000,000.","During the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately 12.8 million shares of common stock, bringing total 2013 purchases to approximately 19.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $1.54 billion or $79.65 per share.","We've continued to buy our common stock in 2014. And as of January 27, total program-to-date purchases were 23.5 million shares at a cost of $1.87 billion or $79.55 per share.","We had $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013, which is up from $649 million at the end of last year. Total debt was $5.8 billion at December 31, 2013, down from $8.1 billion at December 31, 2012.","The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at December 31, 2013, was 19%, which was improved from 27.7% at the end of 2012.","As John has mentioned, the corporation reached agreement today to sell approximately 74,000 acres of its dry gas position in the Utica Shale for $924 million. Approximately 2\/3 of the proceeds are expected to be received at the end of the first quarter, with the balance to be received in the third quarter.","The proceeds from this asset sale will be used for share repurchases. The corporation will determine whether to seek an increase to its existing authorized $4 billion share repurchase program after a final decision is made to either spin or sell retail marketing. If retail is spun off to shareholders, the Utica proceeds will be used towards the $4 billion repurchase program. If retail is sold, we expect to seek board approval to increase the authorized share repurchases.","Turning to 2014 guidance. In addition to the production and capital expenditure guidance provided for E&P by John and Greg, I would like to provide estimates for certain 2014 metrics based on our expected production range of 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which assumes no contribution from Libya.","For the full year 2014, E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel, which is down approximately $3 per barrel from 2013 pro forma cash cost, excluding Libya. This improvement is due to a combination of cost savings and increased production volumes, and the decrease will improve our portfolio's already strong cash margin per BOE.","Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses are expected to be in the range of $29 to $30 per BOE, reflecting greater contributions from Bakken and Valhall, which both have higher DD&A rates than the portfolio average. Total production unit cost for 2014 are estimated to be $49.50 to $51.50 per barrel, which compares to 2013 pro forma unit cost, excluding Libya, of approximately $50 per barrel.","For the full year 2014, the E&P effective tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, is expected to be in the range of 37% to 41%. The corporation has hedged 25,000 barrels per day of Brent crude oil production for the calendar year 2014 at an average price of $109.12 per barrel.","Corporate expenses in 2014 are estimated to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million after taxes, down from adjusted expenses of $161 million in 2013. We expect our 2014 after-tax interest expense to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million, down from $255 million in 2013. As previously guided, our cash flow deficit will be reduced in 2014.","Looking forward, we expect our continued production growth in the Bakken, Valhall and Tubular Bells to generate free cash flow post-2014 at $100 Brent prices.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question is on the '14 production guidance. I know you provided it many ways with different time periods, which is helpful. Yet the clean number x asset sales, x Libya is up 40,000 barrels a day equivalent to 15% for 2014. Can you break that down, the buildup of that 40,000 barrel a day growth? I know you gave the Bakken number, but I didn't -- I don't know if I heard what the year-on-year for Valhall, North Malay and then what you're assuming the ramp in -- of -- in the Gulf of Mexico.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. I think -- yes, thanks, Evan. So I guess, the easiest way to start is with the clean kind of pro forma number for 2013, which is 270,000 barrels a day. And then you add back on to that about 50,000 barrels a day of growth. Obviously, the 2 big contributors there are the Bakken, which is a full year ramp and the T-Bells in the Gulf of Mexico. There are smaller effects due to Valhall and North Malay and also the Utica. So that gets you to 320,000 barrels a day. And then back off about 10,000 for natural field declines and contingency, and that gets you to the mid-point of 310,000.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, I think I got that. And then the -- and for the first quarter guidance, at 275,000, is that x Thailand? Or if the one asset, that you're guiding it without Thailand or with Thailand?","John P. Rielly","Yes. So we're guiding -- all our guidance is pro forma, so that's without Thailand. So if you look at our fourth quarter actually, so the 307,000 and you pulled out and did that on a pro forma basis, it would be 277,000 in the fourth quarter. Basically 15 from Indonesia and 15 from Thailand.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Let me -- again, last question and I'll pass it off, maybe a question from a little bit from left field. But given how wide Gulf Coast differentials were in the fourth quarter of 2013 and market debate on what that might look like on a go-forward basis, I mean, do you see any opportunity to potentially monetize your HOVENSA interests? I mean, I know it's Jones Act exempt and I know that you've got a big cat cracker there. I think you conceivably run that refinery profitability if light discounts were wide enough. I mean, any thoughts around that asset?","John B. Hess","Yes. We and our partners, PDVSA, are in the market looking to see if we might be able to monetize the asset. So a sales process has begun in coordination with the Virgin Island government.","Operator","And your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So a couple of questions for me, please. On the buyback, John Rielly, I guess, you've been pretty clear about you're going to wait on -- to see what happens over the next couple of months with retail. But can you update us, please, on what cash have you received since the end of the year? And where are you on the work-down of the terminals working capital? And if I may just layer on another one same kind of question. What are your intentions if you do spin retail in terms of putting debt on there as a potential contributor to the buyback as well? And I've got a follow-up, please.","John P. Rielly","Sure, I think I have them all, Doug. So since the end of 2013, what we've received as far as asset sales is the Pangkah deal. So the Pangkah deal has closed. So we have the $650 million from that asset sale we've received. As far as the liquidation of inventories from our downstream side of the business, we still have approximately $200 million worth of inventory to liquidate, which we see getting -- doing that kind of throughout the first quarter. So that is also coming. As far as the debt on any potential spin, it's premature for us to talk about it at this point. But, I mean, you could look at that from a capital structure, it won't be different, really, from any of the retail industry peers that you see out there. But at this point, it's a little premature for us to discuss.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So would you plan on dividending that back to the parent, John?","John P. Rielly","So at this point, Doug, we're still in the marketing process. And so we will ultimately get to the capital structure if we do spin retail. But we're going to leave that discussion till later.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. My 2 quick follow-ups, please. John, can you confirm still that you are not paying cash taxes in the U.S.? And if you could confirm again your latest thinking on when you might be paying cash taxes in Norway, and I've got one final one, please.","John P. Rielly","Yes. So, Doug, to your question, I mean, due to our really significant investment in previous years in the United States and in Norway, if I can add it that way, and our continuing significant investments in the U.S. and in Norway, we right now do not see us paying cash taxes in the U.S. or Norway basically through that 2017 guidance that we have given out. So right now, it's extending out beyond 2017.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And my final one is again, I guess, it's a bit like Evan's. It's a bit of an outfield question. But there's been a lot of chatter about rail safety in the Bakken. You guys were early. You and your cars, obviously, it's been a big benefit to you in terms of getting coastal pricing. But can you talk about where your -- the quality of your rail assets as it relates to safety standards and any concerns we should have there about any potential disruption to your coastal pricing? And I'll leave it there.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Okay, great. Thanks, Doug. Yes, well, first of all, safety is obviously important in everything we do at Hess. And our railcars meet the highest standards of the day for specs and maintenance. We built the cars nearly 2 years ago. We worked with the railroad companies and industry experts to design our state-of-the-art railcars to a new standard that's commonly referred to as the petition 1517, 77 design. Now these cars were precisely designed to safely transport Bakken crude grades. And as such, they're equipped with enhanced features and include thicker steel, double-hull bottom, half-head shields, top fittings protection and a reclosing pressure relief device. So they're truly state-of-the-art railcars. Our experience is that rail company operators are equally focused on safety, just as we are. So I think as rail increases in the country and accidents inevitably happen, it's real important to have a regular dialogue between our industry and the rail operators and the government to ensure the overall integrity of these systems. But again, our cars are of the new and of the highest standards available in the rail industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","In Europe, your comments indicate that Valhall seemed to be moving in a better direction, and you spent a minute talking about the development drilling program. And so my question was while that seems to be the primary initiative for improved output and recovery, but is there other factors that could be at work that should -- or that could enhance performance in this area as well? Maybe if you could just kind of provide an update on the plan there? And then also, were the higher depreciation and tax rates on this field the primary driver behind the change in international E&P profitability between the first and the second half? And I know that there were a lot of moving parts, but would that be the first place to start?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Let me start with Valhall. As we've said before, we're implementing a plan with BP to improve performance on Valhall. Our ultimate objective, as well as the operators, is to fill up that capacity at Valhall. There's a number of drilling locations. There's a lot of upside in reserves. It's really going to be key to get our well costs down. So a big effort is going to be on reducing the well costs. Obviously, that will increase the number of drillable locations as you go forward, then also the other factors just to improve the overall operability of the asset, keep your availability and reliability high. So those are the 2 major areas that we're focused on.","John P. Rielly","And then, Doug, to the discussion regarding Valhall and its contribution to the higher DD&A and the higher tax rate, you are correct. So Valhall does have a higher DD&A rate. So as the production is ramped up, that has increased the DD&A rate. And all in, we are still have to record from a book standpoint. So deferred taxes are being recorded at the high statutory rate. They're statutory rate is 78%. So you have the high deferred taxes there. But as I mentioned earlier, so you have higher DD&A and you have that higher tax rate due to deferred taxes, Valhall's cash margin per BOE is significantly higher than our portfolio average on a cash margin basis. So Valhall is contributing very good cash flow to us; and over this period to 2017, significant free cash flow.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on Tioga. When you're thinking about trying to -- so you went down the MLP process, how many quarters of sort of operations do you think you need before you can actually either sell or launch an MLP?","John P. Rielly","Yes. I mean, it's a good point. It's one of the key drivers that we have kind of on the timing of the monetization. So we do believe we need -- I'm going to say at least several months' worth of operating performance on the Tioga Gas Plant. I mean, the other things just in general that we have going on is there's extensive financial, tax and legal preparation work that needs to be completed and is ongoing, the Tioga Gas Plant, as you mentioned. The other thing, which is important, though, the third kind of key driver is we need the results of the tighter down spacing pilots that Greg spoke about earlier. And we want that prior to a monetization event to ensure we maximize shareholder value. So with all those 3 things going on as, John has said earlier, we are aggressively working this monetization, and it will be done by 2015.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful color on what the -- what you need to get through beforehand. And then on the retail spin, and I forget -- I apologize if you have said this before. But on a third-party sale, would there be tax, I mean, as opposed to the tax-free spin that you might be able to do with the private letter ruling?","John P. Rielly","So, I mean, there will be -- it will be a taxable transaction. And so yes, there will be taxes associated with the sale. Now again, you do have a timing of the cash tax payments, but there is -- that would be a taxable sale.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, and then a follow-up on rail. I mean, obviously, the new cars are much better than the old cars. I don't know, I mean, I was -- I've been kind of recently heard on the radio that maybe some of the new cars had also blown up at the tragedy at M\u00e9gantic. Have you sort of done any work on how safe these new cars are relative to some of the news flow that we're seeing on disruptions on rail?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we have. And first of all, the cars that were involved in the explosion were the old design. We know that. Those were the 111 cars. So that's just a rumor. But we -- again, these cars, we worked for over a year with railroad companies and industry experts to really design the safest car we could to transport Bakken crude. So we feel like we are running the safest -- one of the safest fleets in the industry.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I mean, some were worried that you'd have to strip out additional light ends or something before loading the rail. But you feel you don't have to with the quality that you're loading.","Gregory P. Hill","No I don't think so.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Malone of Mizuho Securities.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Yes. John, just wanted to clarify something. Your Bakken guidance increase and your resource upgrade, that is driven still in kind of 9 well per section plan? So you haven't really baked in the upside from a 7, 6 or a 9, 8 configuration into those numbers?","Gregory P. Hill","No, John, we haven't. So you're exactly right. That's based on a 5 and 4 configuration. And as I said in my opening remarks and John mentioned, here, we're going to put in these close space pilots next year, 17 well pads on the 7 and 6, 2 well pads on a 9 and 8. And depending upon the results of that, that could lead to further upside potential in the Bakken.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","When do you think you'll crunch those numbers? You just mentioned the fact that the 2015 plan for monetization in midstream, you'd have to have those data included. Do you anticipate being able to say something on that within -- in calendar 2014?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think probably very late 2014 or early 2015 before we'd be comfortable with that.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And 17 rigs planned for this year. How do you see those being layered in over time?","Gregory P. Hill","We're operating 17 rigs today.","John B. Hess","In the Bakken.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. Last question just the $7.6 million well cost. You mentioned the fact that you may be able to squeeze more gains out of that. What's sort of the low hanging fruit there? What could still be done to bring those costs down?","Gregory P. Hill","John, I think it really is -- I think most of the low hanging fruit is gone. This is now in the lean manufacturing mode of just continuous improvements day in, day out, month-on-month, right?","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to take another swing at the Bakken. If we were to see a real change in Department of Transportation regulations that truly impacted how we're hauling crude today, notwithstanding the quality of your railcar fleet, what are your options, pipe versus rail here? Can you give us an idea of your flexibility to switch between one and the other?","John B. Hess","Yes. We also have pipeline access of 60,000 to 70,000 barrels a day right now. Some of which we're using, some of which we're not because there are better differentials to put it on rail. So we actually are well positioned should something happen. Having said that, there are probably about 30,000 crude railcars in the United States, and 10,000 of them are the new modern standards that we have that others have as well. So it's really the 20,000, I think, that the government and industry, both rail and oil, are going to be addressing. So having said that, we and the industry in oil are going to work with rail and the government to really try to be thoughtful but also responsive to the safety issues.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. The other question I had, free cash flow expectations in 2015 are based on $100 Brent. What sort of differential are you presuming for your Bakken production there?","John P. Rielly","Obviously, differentials are moving around. So what we're generally assuming is a differential, let's just say of using TI, and you can go off of that. It's somewhere in the $5 to $10 range.","Operator","Thank you very much.

My name is Liz, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay Wilson","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess\u2019 annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also on today\u2019s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","As usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John Hess","Thank you, Jay. Welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operating performance, and then John Rielly will review our financial results.","We had an outstanding year in terms of operational performance and continued execution of our long-term strategy, achieving a number of important milestones and delivering higher production and lower capital exploratory expenditures than our original guidance. With Guyana and the Bakken as our growth engines and Malaysia and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as our cash engines, our portfolio is on track to deliver increasing and strong financial returns, visible and low risk production growth and industry leading cash flow growth.","It is important to note that both Guyana and the Bakken will become significant cash generators over the next several years. As we have stated in our investor presentations, where we provide a financial outlook through 2025, our portfolio is positioned to generate approximately 20% compound annual cash flow growth and more than 10% compound annual production growth. And our portfolio breakeven is projected to decrease to below $40 per barrel Brent by 2025.","As our free cash flow grows, we will prioritize return of capital to shareholders both in terms of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Another key element of our strategy is maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position and managing risk. We ended the year with more than $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and have hedged 150,000 barrels of oil per day in 2020 using put options, with 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel WTI and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel Brent.","With outstanding execution throughout our portfolio, we were able to reduce our full year 2019 capital and exploratory expenditures to $2.74 billion, down approximately $150 million from our original guidance. We have kept our 2020 capital and exploratory budget to $3 billion in line with the guidance we provided at our December 2018 Investor Day.","During the fourth quarter, we closed the previously announced transaction in which Hess Midstream converted to an Up-C corporate structure and acquired Hess Infrastructure Partners. As a result of the transaction, we received approximately $300 million in cash and own 47% of Hess Midstream.","Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. 2019 was an outstanding year in terms of both exploration and developments. On December 20th, the Liza Phase 1 development achieved first production and is expected to reach its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day in the coming months. We recognize this pivotal moment in Guyana\u2019s history and are committed to working collaboratively with the government, our partners and the people of Guyana to build a safe and sustainable industry that fulfills the promise of shared prosperity.","The Liza Unity floating production storage and offloading vessel or FPSO is under construction for the second phase of Liza development. It is expected to start production in Guyana by mid-2022 with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Front-end engineering design for a third FPSO, the prosperity is underway to develop the Payara field pending government approvals and project sanctioning. Production from Payara could start as early as 2023, reaching an estimated 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.","From an exploration perspective, 2019 was a banner year with five new discoveries at Haimara, Tilapia, Yellowtail, Tripletail and Mako. On Monday, we announced an increase in the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block to more than 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We continue to see multi-billion barrels of exploration potential remaining. We also announced a significant oil discovery at Uaru marking the 16th discovery on the Stabroek Block. The Uaru discovery will be incremental to the new resources estimate.","Turning to the Bakken, our largest operated asset. Our team had a very strong year. Full year net production in 2019 for the Bakken averaged 152,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, well above our original guidance range of 135,000 to 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and nearly 30% higher than 2018. Our Bakken performance showed the benefits of our successful transition to plug-and-perf completions.","As a result, net oil production for 2019 was up 22% compared to 2018 and we are on track for Bakken production to average approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our successful oil discovery last quarter at Esox will be brought online next month as a low-cost tieback to the Tubular Bells production facilities. Hess is the operator and holds a 57.14% interest.","Now turning to our 2019 financial results for the fourth quarter. Our adjusted net loss was $180 million compared to adjusted net loss of $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting the effects of lower realized prices. Full year 2019 net production was 290,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, 17% higher than the pro forma 248,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day produced in 2018.","In 2020 our net production is forecast to average between 330,000 and 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Bakken net production is forecast to average approximately 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020. As we continue to execute our strategy, our board, our leadership team and each of our employees will be guided by our longstanding commitment to sustainability in terms of safety, protecting the environment and making a positive impact on the communities where we operate.","We are gratified to have been recognized by a number of third-party organizations for the quality of our environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure, most recently achieving leadership status in CDP\u2019s Global Climate Analysis for the 11th consecutive year.","In summary, we are proud of our 2019 performance and look forward to continuing this momentum into 2020 and future years, as we execute our differentiated long-term strategy. With increasing cash margins and production volumes, our cash flow through 2025 is projected to grow at a rate that outpaces our industry peers and most companies in the S&P 500. As our portfolio generates increasing cash flow, the majority will be deployed toward increased return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Greg Hill","Thanks, John. 2019 marked another year of exceptional performance and strategic execution. In particular, I would like to call out three major operational highlights from 2019. First, we beat our guidance for both production and for capital and exploratory expenditures. Our 2019 net production averaged 290,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was above our original guidance of between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and also above our more recent guidance of approximately 285,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. At the same time, our 2019 capital and exploratory expenditures were $2.74 billion, approximately $150 million below our original guidance.","Second, we continued our extraordinary run of success on the 6.6 million acres Stabroek Block in Guyana with five discoveries with the start of production from the Liza Phase 1 development in December ahead of schedule and under budget, and with the sanction of the Liza Phase 2 development, which is on track for first oil by mid-2022.","Third, in the Bakken we successfully completed our transition to plug-and-perf completions, while driving down drilling and completion costs. Our plug-and-perf transition has on average delivered a 15% uplift in IP180 production, at the same time, we reduced our drilling and completion costs from an average of approximately $7.5 million per well in the fourth quarter of 2018 to approximately $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. By the end of 2020, we expect our D&C costs will approach $6 million per well.","Proved reserves at the end of 2019 stood at 1.197 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions and revisions in 2019 totaled 121 million barrels of oil equivalent, including negative net price revisions of 35 million barrels of oil equivalent, resulting in an overall 2019 production replacement ratio of 104%. The majority of the additions were in the Bakken and Guyana.","Now turning to production. In the fourth quarter of 2019 company-wide net production averaged 316,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day driven by strong performance across the portfolio and in particular the Bakken. For the full year 2020, we forecast net production to average between 330,000 and 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which is a 15% increase from 2019.","In the first quarter of 2020, we forecast net production to average between 320,000 and 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Bakken fourth quarter net production averaged 174,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 38% above the year ago quarter and above our guidance of 165,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2019, Bakken net production averaged 152,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above our original guidance of between 135,000 and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and our most recent full year guidance of 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. These results reflect the strong performance of our plug-and-perf completions and the quality of our acreage position.","For the full year 2020, we forecast Bakken net production to average approximately 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is approximately 18% higher than 2019. Our full year forecast reflects the impact of a 45 day planned shutdown of the Tioga Gas Plant in the third quarter. During the shutdown, we will perform a turnaround and tie in the planned expansion project, which will increase capacity from 250 million cubic feet per day to 400 million cubic feet per day.","In 2020, we expect to drill approximately 170 wells and bring approximately 175 new wells online, compared with 160 wells drilled and 156 wells brought online in 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, we expect Bakken net production to average approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our first quarter 2020 forecast reflects lower planned activity levels, due to seasonally difficult winter weather conditions, where we expect to bring online approximately 30 new wells compared with 59 in the fourth quarter of 2019.","Net production will increase in the Bakken throughout the year, growing to approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of 2020. As discussed previously, we plan to drop our rig count from six rigs in 2020, four in 2021. At this level of activity, we expect to hold production relatively flat for at least five years and generate approximately $750 million of free cash flow annually, at $55 per barrel WTI.","Moving to the offshore, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production average 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2019 in line with our guidance. Our focused exploration program in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico yielded an oil discovery in the fourth quarter at the Esox-1 well in Mississippi Canyon.","A dual completion was successfully run and the subsea installation is underway, which will tieback to the Tubular Bells production facility. We expect to achieve first oil in February. Esox is a high return, cash generative tieback opportunity that was well executed. The timeframe from discovery to first oil is expected to be less than four months.","In 2020, we forecast net production from our deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes extended planned maintenance shutdowns in the second quarter. At the Malaysia, Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2019.","At the North Malay Basin, also in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess is operator and has a 50% interest, net production averaged 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019. Combined net production from our JDA and North Malay Basin assets is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2020.","Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. In December, we announced a 15th discovery on the block at the Mako-1 well located approximately 6 miles southeast of the Liza field. Mako-1 drilled in 5,315 feet of water, encountered approximately 164 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir.","On Monday, we announced another significant oil discovery at Uaru, which is located approximately 10 miles northeast of the Liza field. Uaru-1 well drilled in 6,342 feet of water, encountered approximately 94 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. The well was drilled in a down-dip location on a large stratigraphic trap, further appraisal and testing is planned.","Based on the 15 discoveries through year-end 2019, the estimate of growth discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block has been increased to more than 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up for more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent only one year ago. The Uaru discovery is incremental to this new resource estimate. The continuing growth of the resource base on the block has been truly remarkable.","Looking forward, after the Noble Tom Madden completes the evaluation of the Uaru discovery, the drillship will move to development drilling for Liza Phase 2. The Stena Carron is currently engaged on a well test at the Yellowtail discovery, after which it will drill and test the Yellowtail-2 appraisal well. After completing the evaluation program for Mako-1, the Noble Don Taylor next drill and test the Longtail-2 appraisal well.","Finally, the Noble Bob Douglas will continue drilling development wells. As announced on Monday, the operator intends to bring in a fifth drillship later this year. We expect the first half of 2020 will be dominated by appraisal activities, primarily in the greater Turbot area. In the second half of the year, we plan to drill several new exploration wells, including some that will test the emerging deeper plays on the Stabroek Block.","Turning now to our Guyana developments, on December 20, production commenced from the Liza Phase 1 development less than five years after the discovery of hydrocarbons and wellhead of the industry average for deepwater developments. The project also came in under budget and with the sanction of Liza Phase 1 was budgeted at $4.4 billion gross, including the purchase of the FPSO. We now expect the gross cost for the development to be approximately $3.5 billion or 21% below the sanction estimate.","Liza Phase 1 production continues to ramp up. Current gross production is approximately 75,000 barrels of oil per day from three of the five producers available at start-up. Production is expected to reach the FPSO capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day in the coming month. For the full year 2020, we forecast our net production to average approximately 25,000 barrels of oil per day.","The Liza Phase 2 development is progressing to plan. On January 13, the hole for the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have a capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day arrived at the Keppel yard in Singapore. Construction of all 13 deck modules is currently underway. Meanwhile, in Guyana, installation of subsea flow lines and equipment is underway and development drilling is expected to begin next month. We continue to forecast first oil by mid-2022.","Pending government approvals and project sanctioning, a third development at Payara is planned to utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day with first oil as early as 2023. Together with Hammerhead, discoveries on the southeast portion of the block including Turbot, Yellowtail, Longtail, Pluma, Tilapia and Tripletail will underpin future FPSOs.","In closing, our execution continues to be strong. The Bakken is on a capital efficient growth trajectory. Our offshore assets and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia continue to generate significant free cash flow, and Guyana continues to get bigger and better, all of which positions us to deliver industry leading returns, material free cash flow generation, and significant shareholder value.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John Rielly","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2019.","We incurred a net loss of $222 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to a net loss of $212 million in the third quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we incurred a net loss of $180 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a net of $105 million in the previous quarter.","For E&P, on an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $124 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to a net loss of $41 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2019 were as follows: higher exploration costs reduced results by $56 million; lower realized selling prices reduced results by $13 million; all other items reduced results by $14 million for an overall reduction in fourth quarter results of $83 million.","For Midstream, on an adjusted basis, the Midstream segment had net income of $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $39 million in the previous quarter, reflecting higher throughput volumes. Midstream EBITDA, on an adjusted basis and before non-controlling interest, amounted to $157 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $134 million in the previous quarter. For corporate, on an adjusted basis, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $105 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $103 million in the previous quarter. ","Now turning to our financial position, at quarter-end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $1.540 billion and total liquidity was $5.4 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.640 billion.","In December 2019, Hess Midstream completed its previously announced acquisition of Hess Infrastructure Partners with a conversion to an Up-C corporate structure and incentive distribution rights simplification. As consideration for the transaction, we received additional shares and approximately $300 million in cash. We now own approximately 134 million shares of Hess Midstream or approximately 47%.","In the fourth quarter of 2019, net cash provided from operating activities was $286 million or $550 million before changes in working capital and items affecting comparability. While cash outlays for capital expenditures were $825 million in the fourth quarter. Changes in working capital reduce cash flows from operating activities by $234 million in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting premiums paid for crude oil hedging contracts.","For calendar year 2020, our crude oil hedge positions consist of WTI put options with a notional amount of 130,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel and Brent put options with a notional amount of 20,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel.","Now turning to guidance, first for exploration and production, we project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $11.50 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2020. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $16.50 to $17.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2020. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $28 to $30 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2020.","As guided earlier, capital and exploratory expenditures in 2020 are expected to be $3 billion. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the first quarter with full year 2020 guidance expected to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million.","The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million in the first quarter, with full year 2020 guidance expected to be in the range of $940 million to $965 million. E&P tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million for the first quarter and in the range of $80 million to $90 million for the full year 2020.","As highlighted earlier, we have purchased crude oil hedge positions for calendar year 2020. We expect non-cash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices to reduce our results by approximately $70 million per quarter.","Now turning to Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million in the first quarter and full year 2020 guidance is expected to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million.","For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter and full year 2020 guidance is expected to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million for the first quarter, with the full year 2020 guidance expected to be $350 million to $360 million. The increase from 2019 is due to ceasing interest capitalization at the Liza field, which commenced production in December 2019.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Guys, it looks like the market doesn\u2019t like the guidance too much. So I wonder if we could talk a little bit about the cadence of what\u2019s going on with downtime through the course of the year. Greg, you touched on Tioga. But I want \u2013 obviously, you\u2019ve given us a first quarter run rate for the Bakken. But can you kind of walk us through how that progress is through the year, because clearly 174,000 in fourth quarter and 180,000 average for the full year looks a little soft and maybe touch on the Gulf of Mexico planned downtime as well?","Greg Hill","Yes. Thanks, Doug. So as we mentioned, we do have the turnaround at Tioga gas plant. It\u2019s going to be about 45 days. And we\u2019re going to turn it around and also tie in the gas plant expansion as we mentioned. Now that\u2019s not going to have much impact, if any on oil. It\u2019s going to be primarily gas. And the net effect of that is about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. If I turned it\u2026","Doug Leggate","For the year, Greg, or for the quarter?","Greg Hill","Yes, for the year.","Doug Leggate","For the year.","Greg Hill","Thanks, Doug. And then if I turned to the Gulf of Mexico, we have two major shutdowns in the second quarter, one at Conger and one at Llano, both of which are down for 30 days. We also have Penn State down for about eight days in the second quarter. So the net impact of that on the quarter is about 13,000 barrels a day.","Doug Leggate","Okay. That starts to make a bit more sense, and I appreciate the emphasis that oil doesn\u2019t gets hit. Thank you for that. My follow-up is, so not to be too predictable, it\u2019s obviously on Guyana. And I know we have the Exxon Analyst Day on March 5, so to the extent you can share. It seems that the appraisal activity focus around Turbot is probably, I\u2019m guessing, is to define what the scale of that development is going to look like over time. And you\u2019ve previously defined that as a major development hub, but we also know that Hammerhead has been passed to the development team for Exxon. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can kind of walk us through your current thought on the timing over the scale of that 2025 run rate, and John Rielly, how does that impact the 2018 guidance, you gave us over run rate $3 billion capital program? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Greg Hill","Yes, thanks Doug. I think, as we\u2019ve spoken before, you\u2019re right, I mean Hammerhead has been passed off to the development team that notionally right now is about 140,000 barrels of oil capacity, kind of vessel. And then as you mentioned, all of the appraisal activities that are ongoing really what I call on the eastern seaboard between Turbot and Liza are really trying to understand, how many vessels will it take to evacuate all of that oil, which is substantial along that eastern seaboard.","So clearly, vessel 5 is going to be in that area and probably several vessels after that, but we\u2019re trying to figure all that out. How many vessels will it take? And obviously, the fifth vessel will be a large one. It\u2019ll be in the 220,000 class, like the others are. But specific timing of the number of vessels and timing of the ones after five, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re working on. And that\u2019s kind of the heavy lift for this year, Doug, to really understand that.","John Rielly","And then, Doug, as far as our capital program is, as we laid out on our Investor Day, we had $3 billion this year. We do have, if you see from the Investor Day, a little bit more next year as we move on with these developments. And then as we\u2019ve talked about as an approximate $3 billion, and right now there\u2019s no change to that number. We\u2019ve got a nice cadence going to Exxon, as an aside, has been doing a fantastic job on the execution of Phase 1. And now Phase 2 is the execution is going along well. And so it\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re doing a great job for Guyana and for the partners.","So what we\u2019re seeing from our capital program is that, that $3 billion is a good number right now. As Greg said, we\u2019re unsure of FPSOs beyond the five and we\u2019ll see that. But again, that will be much later in the profile of our timing of free cash flow, because as you remember, once Phase 2 comes on, it\u2019s a big inflection point for us from a free cash flow standpoint. So any FPSOs would be at six, seven or something beyond that. We\u2019ll be in a good period for us when we\u2019re generating a lot of free cash flow.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate that guys and I\u2019ll see you in a couple of weeks. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. Maybe one follow-up initially on Guyana. Can you talk about on the upwards revision to the resource estimate to 8 billion barrels, was all that based on the inclusion of incremental discoveries since the last estimate? Or was there any component driven by upward revisions to estimates at prior discovery? Maybe just can you talk about the primary drivers of what you continue to see as a significant upward pressure on resource?","Greg Hill","No. I think the absolute grand majority of that was all new discoveries. So it\u2019s just continuing to add to this extraordinary success rate, five in 2019 and already another one in 2020 with more to come.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. And then maybe a follow-up in the Bakken. And then Bakken continues to exceed expectations in terms of productivity, and also impressive costs. Can you talk about some of the drivers of what you\u2019ve seen in terms of the strong Bakken production? And maybe you highlighted Exxon targeted reductions of well cost for the Bakken in 2020. What are the drivers and what are you seeing there in terms of costs in the basin?","Greg Hill","Yes. So let me start with cost first. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I\u2019m really proud of the team and their ability to drive costs down with lean manufacturing. So if you think about our journey in 2019, we started at $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, $7.3 million in Q1, $7 million in Q2, $6.7 million in Q3, and $6.5 million in Q4. So that\u2019s an amazing cost reduction over 12 months driven primarily by lean manufacturing, but also technology.","And then as we look forward to next year, obviously that flattens out a bit part of lean manufacturing. But we still think we\u2019ll be at $6 million by the end of the year. The biggest driver on that is going to be, again, technology and lean. But we also are seeing some softness in the sand costs and also pressure pumping. So we built some of that into our cost estimates for next year.","Regarding the productivity, really a function of where we\u2019re drilling, but also the plug-and-perf coming in very well. So on average, our IP180 are up 15%, but if you look at certain areas of the field, particularly, in the southern part of the field, we\u2019ve outperformed that 15% in those areas and those are very good prolific areas of the Bakken. And as we look forward to our 2020 program, again, it\u2019s 175 wells be very similar, EURs kind of in the 1 to 1.2 range, IP180s in the 1.10 to 1.20 range. And the IRR is at 60%, well above 75%. So again, a very strong program in 2020.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks Greg. Very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to follow-up on that Bakken question, and this may be premature, but given that you\u2019re continuing to see improvements as we think about holding flat at 200,000 a day, kind of end of this year onwards, any reason at this point? Or any optimism to think about that costing less, or maybe not taking quite four rigs as we go forward? Or do we just need to balance that as you kind of move from, as you mentioned the premium spots to maybe the next tier down that\u2019s incorporated in the outlet?","Greg Hill","Yes. I think it\u2019s a balance as you said. So we\u2019re pretty confident that we can hold it flat at the 200,000 range for at least five years and probably longer. And as you mentioned, as technology improvements to continue to occur, as costs potentially continue to come down, obviously that plateau be extended even longer. And I will mention that in our Tier 2 acreage, we are doing a lot of trials on proppant loading, on number of entry points on spacing. So we are not \u2013 we\u2019re not decided yet in some of those areas exactly what that\u2019s going to be. So the assumption going forward is none of that\u2019s built-in. So I\u2019m very optimistic that that will get much better as we go forward as we learn in those areas.","Roger Read","Yes. It certainly has not been a static environment so far, right? One other question and it\u2019s got two parts, I apologize for doing it that way, but it\u2019s some of the pushback we\u2019ve gotten post results here. One is the hedging programs. So I\u2019ll just kind of put the question up to you of why hedge? The second part is, we did see debt go up in the quarter. It looks like mostly that was to take care of the Midstream side of things. But I was wondering if you could clarify on those two points for us.","John Rielly","Sure, Roger, and only do the second one first, it\u2019s quick to debt. That went up was related to Midstream and the completion of the transaction that we spoke about, the acquisition of Hess Infrastructure Partners and the conversion to the Up-C that was the debt. So it\u2019s just purely Midstream debt. That is non-recourse to Hess. As far as the hedging, Roger, the price we have that, from our Investor Day there, with Bakken getting up to 200,000 barrels a day and bringing on Phase 2.","So what we do is, we look at it year-by-year and we put these hedges on for insurance just to ensure that we can fund that investment program because of the returns of that program will drive for us. So we\u2019re getting closer and closer. Phase 2, right, is mid-2022. We just want to finish this Guyana program, executed, continue to execute that. And as Greg say, continue to execute our six rig program, which will drop the four rigs the following year. And so we just put hedges on for insurance purposes and hopefully we don\u2019t use them.","Roger Read","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.","Jeanine Wai","Hi, good morning, everyone. I guess my two questions are on CapEx and Guyana. The first one is, it looks like total E&P CapEx for the quarter came in a little bit higher than expected and I believe some of that might be related to Guyana. So can you provide any color on that and any implications for Phase 2 that it may imply?","John Rielly","It did come in for the quarter, very small amount. Again, we just went out with an approximately $850 million, came in at $876 million. As Greg mentioned, with the Bakken, we did get a little bit more completions in Bakken. And so a little bit is in the Bakken, a little bit of it is an acceleration in Guyana, and the rest of it is kind of just through the portfolio, really small numbers. Again, we were just given approximate amounts. So there\u2019s no implication on that going forward. We had the $3 billion capital that we set. We are going up approximately $300 million in Guyana next year versus 2019. And again, we laid that out for the continuation of Phase 1, $400 million for Phase 2, and then the rest of it for Phase 3 and future developments.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you for that. My second question on Guyana, can you comment on any of the recent news headlines about the potential for contract renegotiation?","John Hess","Yes. Most of the news that you hear is not from reliable sources, neither the current government or opposition government. I think they both have been pretty clear that they\u2019re going to honor the PSC. So I think that\u2019s the real takeaway you should have.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask you, you talked about having the first tanker loading attributed to Hess or allocated that has in March with 1 million barrels. How do you see the listings or tanker loadings progressing throughout the year? Should we always be thinking about the same sort of capacity and what kind of cadence are you expecting throughout the year?","John Rielly","So the cadence can move around a little bit from that on how they get allocated. But here there\u2019s a general rule of thumb, it will be 1 million barrels each lift. And for us, as you heard, Greg gave the guidance on Guyana, that it\u2019s 25,000 barrels a day for the year. If you multiply that by 365, you\u2019re getting just about 9 million, little over 9 million barrels. So we expect just from a forecast standpoint to have nine lifts this year. I can\u2019t exactly be specific, which quarters that we come in our first lift, you\u2019re right, is expected in early March.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. I appreciate that. But it does sound like your net sales amount as approximating your production guidance for the year. So that\u2019s incorrect.","John Rielly","That is correct. Quarter-by-quarter, you could get some under over lifts, but right. For the full year, it \u2013 the sales should approximate the production amount.","David Deckelbaum","Got it. And then just to revisit some in the Bakken guidance, I know that it\u2019s difficult to forecast with lumpiness around the quarters. But the expectation is that you\u2019d be exiting 2020 at approximately that 200 equivalent target?","Greg Hill","Yes. Yes, we\u2019ll achieve that sometime in the fourth quarter.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. And then the \u2013 in the third quarter with the Tioga turnaround and expansion, how is it that oil volumes are not impacted there from a logistical perspective?","Greg Hill","Well, again, there are separate systems, right? So you can \u2013 the gas is separated on the pad from the oil and it goes through a separate system. So you can still produce the oil, but obviously that gas goes through the plant, so that\u2019s where the impacts going to be. So we\u2019ll do some local flaring on the pads and some flaring at the gas plant as well during that 45 day shutdown. But the oil will largely stay on.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. But I guess as a total program, you\u2019d still be under the regulations for flaring at the state level?","Greg Hill","Yes. Yes, there will be some restrictions that we\u2019ll have to deal with. But of course, you can get some dispensation for things like turnarounds, et cetera.","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate the color on that. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m just curious a little bit of an accounting question. I guess, on the Guyana volumes the 25,000 a day, does that include costs barrel recoveries? If so, how much, if not, how should we think about that for 2020?","John Rielly","It does include that. It\u2019s just part of the normal production sharing contract that cost recovery barrels are included as part of our production and the partners production.","Michael Hall","And do you have an estimate of how much of that is cost recovery by chance?","John Rielly","I could walk you maybe through a little bit more detail after the call, but the contract that is out there that you can see, but the way it basically works is on the revenue, then 75% of the revenue goes for cost recovery for the contractors. So that\u2019s how you can factor in. Then you go into profit share after that.","Michael Hall","Okay. Yes. Just want to make sure we\u2019re calibrating right. And then, I was curious, I guess the Gulf of Mexico, the capital on the 2020 plan. I think we backed into around $350 million or so relative to 2018 Analyst Day you talked about annual average capital of $150 million to sustain 65 MBOE a day. So I\u2019m just trying to line those two things up and should we be \u2013 how do we reconcile those two things?","John Rielly","I just want to make sure that we are on the same page with the numbers. So in our release that we went out for 2020, the Gulf of Mexico capital will be approximately $135 million for this year. That\u2019s we\u2019re spending from a production aspect of it. Last year we did have a higher amount, it was approximately $290 million. And that is because we were running full year, we had two rigs running for Stampede, which will be coming off contract here basically in the second quarter. So there\u2019s lower Gulf of Mexico spend. And so as you know, we will be tying in Esox, which again helps and keeps us at that 65,000 barrels a day, that we\u2019ve talked about.","Greg Hill","And then, as we did mention, going forward, you can expect about $150 million to $200 million of CapEx per annum for infill and tie-back wells. And this is our objective in the short-term to medium-term to maintain the Gulf at about 65,000 barrels a day. And we\u2019ve been very successful doing that. If you look at Conger-10, that was about 6,000 barrels a day. Penn State-6, about 14,000 barrels a day, Llano-5, about 8,000 and Esox is anticipated to be a very good well. We see four to six more things that we\u2019d like to drill in the next couple of years and our expectation of keeping those hubs full. Then beyond that, of course it\u2019ll be greenfield. So we\u2019ll drill a greenfield expiration well probably one a year on average over the next several years. Again, trying to maintain that production or potentially even growing it with the new hub.","Michael Hall","Okay. Yes, I guess \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. I guess, maybe make sure I\u2019m thinking about the numbers right here. I was trying to connect $1.73 billion of total U.S. capital per the release with the $1.375 billion in the Bakken and the remainder being in the Gulf of Mexico. I\u2019m assuming some of that being for exploration. So I guess, what\u2019s being spent in the U.S. outside of the Bakken and the Gulf of Mexico if anything? And how would you break out the $1.73 billion between the Bakken and the Gulf of Mexico?","John Rielly","So let\u2019s \u2013 so you have $1.730 billion, you\u2019re saying in the U.S. right? So you have $1.730 billion back out the Bakken, which is $1.375 billion, right, in production. And you\u2019re going to back out $1.35 billion for the Gulf of Mexico, right. So then the rest of that amount is in exploration. That can be wells being drilled or seismic being spent. So that approximate $200 million that you have left relates to exploration.","Michael Hall","Sure. Okay. And that exploration is all in the Gulf?","John Rielly","In the Gulf, correct. At U.S. piece, correct.","Michael Hall","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.","Paul Cheng","Hey guys. Good morning. I apologize that I joined late. So if my questions have already been answered, just let me know. So I would just look at the transcript. John, I think two quick questions for you. On the accounting, the hedging premium amortization, the $70 million a quarter, is that pretax and after? And also from an accounting standpoint it seems in Guyana, you have the government willing to pickup the income. So when you guys reported, are you going to report that the corresponding tax as it grows up and then that you report it also with the tax or that you just don\u2019t report any tax at all. How is the accounting treatment going to be?","John Rielly","Okay. So first on the hedges, it is pretax and post-tax. So that will be the same amount, because we have a valuation allowance against our net operating losses in the U.S. So that will be the same number. In Guyana, we do pay taxes. It\u2019s in the entitlement of our contract. So the taxes are embedded in our entitlement, effectively reducing our entitlement. And therefore, what we do then with our entitlement for financial reporting purposes is disaggregate that, and then show the tax and gross it up from relating to that. I can walk you through that more after the call, but that is how we are doing it.","Paul Cheng","Yes. Because I think that\u2019s how Apache have done in Egypt. I just wanted to make sure that that\u2019s the same methodology because that\u2019s how we modeling right now.","John Rielly","Yes. That is how we\u2019re working. Happy to discuss that further, we can do that.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And Greg, when I\u2019m looking at your production guidance that seems conservative. Is there any area that maybe we have a bit of more of the upside?","Greg Hill","I think you probably miss the \u2013 you probably missed the start of the call where we kind of went through the shutdowns. Again, Tioga Gas Plant down 45 days and then a heavy maintenance buried in the Gulf of Mexico where we have two of our big assets down 30 days in the second quarter. So that\u2019s really kind of what reduced our normal capacity of our production with those two shutdowns.","Paul Cheng","Okay. I will read the transcript. And then the final one, have you guys booked any additional reserve related to the Liza 1 last year?","John Rielly","We booked a minor amount for the wells that we were drilled here. Again, rule of thumbs, Paul probably we\u2019ve got a third of the reserves on the books right now for Phase 1. And then as we get the dynamic data, see how the injection goes, we\u2019ll begin to pick up additional reserves.","Paul Cheng","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","Guys, thanks for taking the question. So this year after about five years, you will begin to drill on a brand new exploration block Indiana. And given your experience on Stabroek, I\u2019m curious, what kind of expectations should we be thinking about in terms of pre-drill estimates and the geology of this new acreage that you are going to be getting underway?","Greg Hill","No. I think you\u2019re referring to the Kaieteur Block, which is outboard of Stabroek, which we have a 15% interest in Exxon, the operator. See very similar play types that exist on the Liza block around the Stabroek Block. And in fact, we\u2019ll split our first well a well called Tanager this year on that block, so stay tuned.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. All right, fair enough. And a question about Hess Midstream. So now that the Bakken is very close to it, if it\u2019s not reaching plateau. What\u2019s going to be the dropdown model for the MLP if the underlying production is essentially flat-lining?","Greg Hill","So for Hess Midstream now, it\u2019s not an MLP and all the assets in North Dakota have been acquired by the Midstream, because we completed that transaction in the fourth quarter. So they now have all the gathering facility there and the Tioga Gas Plant. So from the old dropdown model that won\u2019t be happening going forward. So what you do have here is this growth that we have. So in the Bakken, obviously, we\u2019re going from 180,000 to 200,000 barrels a day, they\u2019re going to pick up that growth, the Hess Midstream picking up that.","Then as you know, the flaring regulations get tighter and tighter as we move on in North Dakota. And so what Hess Midstream is doing now is they\u2019ve completed the LM4 plant and so picked up additional gas processing capacity there. We\u2019re doing the expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant. And so that\u2019s going up to 400 million cubic feet a day and it is looking to pick up third-party business as these flaring regulations get tighter and tighter and we are in a good infrastructure position in a good position to pick up that. So there\u2019s a lot of growth going from there and they\u2019ll look for other opportunities up there in North Dakota.","Pavel Molchanov","All right. Appreciate it guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. Can you talk about the benefits and risks in Guyana, co-development of FPSOs and how discussions and plans with the operator are evolving, if at all? As you ramp up the first FPSO and you gain greater insight into the reservoir and processes. How on the table is this when you look out to FPSO three, four, five or beyond?","Greg Hill","No. I think, Brian, the current strategy, which we agree with is, the design one, build many, because you can get such leverage of learnings as you go from vessel one to two to three, right? Now, what is likely going to happen is the timeframe between those vessels will begin to collapse. So from a cadence of maybe one a year, maybe becomes every nine months or potentially even every six months, as you get out in time. That\u2019s what those synergies will do for you. So that\u2019s what we really see. We don\u2019t really see doubling or tripling up because that\u2019s very inefficient. But rather design one, build many that continue to collapse the timeframe based on efficiencies.","John Hess","Yes. And just to embellish on that. It\u2019s really a phased approach to be capital efficient. ExxonMobil has done a great job of optimizing the development, lowering the costs, the learnings from ship one, help us in ship two and that will continue in ship three. So we\u2019re really looking at a phased approach, but as Greg said, maybe with more compression of the timeframe. I just want to remind everyone, the 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent we talked about, we\u2019ve had 16 successes. So it\u2019s basically a 500 million per discovery. And that\u2019s world-class and it\u2019s got very low cost, very high returns. And ExxonMobil is doing a great job moving the project forward.","Brian Singer","Great. Thanks. And then John, in your opening comments, you talked about cash flow overtime going to dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchase. Is there any change in the timing of when you would expect to consider that? Is that still when you get more indifferent cash flow mode post or with the startup of Phase 2 in Guyana? Or is that something that we could see earlier or later than that?","John Rielly","No, I would say right now stick with our guidance that it\u2019s going to be timed with Phase 2 coming online. Again that is the big inflection point for us from a free cash flow and earnings standpoint.","John Hess","And the priority would be on increasing the dividend as the first call.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vin Lovaglio with Mizuho Securities. Mr. Lovaglio, your phone may be on mute.","Paul Sankey","Hello? Hi. Sorry, it\u2019s Paul Sankey here. Can you hear me?","John Hess","Yes, we can hear you Paul.","Paul Sankey","Sorry about that. I got myself on mute. Guys you put out a note on the ESG and oil and gas, and you attested very, very well in terms of certainly your disclosures. Can you talk a little bit about some of the areas where you think you can still get better? And I\u2019m specifically thinking about flaring. And beyond that could you talk about the impact of Guyana and how that will change some of the metrics that you do such a great job of disclosing? Thanks.","John Hess","Thank you, Paul. Obviously, ESG sustainability is core value for the company. We\u2019ve been doing a sustainability report for 22 years. We\u2019re honored and proud to be an industry leader. We want to make sure we continue that leadership role. As we look at our flaring, let\u2019s say in the Bakken, we\u2019re ahead of the state limits and we have a program in place to continue that. And we\u2019re looking at updating our sustainability efforts in terms of the environment. And we\u2019ll be coming out with some new targets within the year for the next five years. So that\u2019s a work in progress. But we always want to stay ahead of the regulations.","And in terms of Guyana, the gas is basically reinjected. Again, ExxonMobil does a great job, minimizing the flaring in startup, et cetera. But the majority of gas is reinjected, so there\u2019s really not an issue there. And one of the things we\u2019re going to be looking at in Guyana is how can we help the country going forward in social responsibility, which is something that\u2019s very important to our company and our board and every employee.","Paul Sankey","Got it. John, thanks very much for that. And then a follow-up on the previous hedging question, totally different subject. How do you expect that hedging program that has sort of changed around a little bit overtime? I wonder how you expect Guyana to affect that going forward and whether or not you will have a different hedging strategy, let\u2019s say in perhaps five years time? Thanks.","John Rielly","Sure. I mean, we do look at it, Paul, year-to-year and make our decisions on our hedging requirements. And right now, obviously with the investment still going in for Guyana until we get to that Phase 2, we wanted to put a significant amount insurance on to ensure we fund that. As we move forward and we get to more free cash flow, we\u2019ll still be, obviously have a heavy oil portion in our portfolio. We\u2019ll make those decisions year-to-year and we could make some different decisions at that point in time.","Paul Sankey","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"10522":["Hess (NYSE:HES) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 30, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Jay R. Wilson - Vice President of Investor Relations","John B.

My name is Erin, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Erin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements.","With me today are John Hess, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President, Worldwide Exploration and Production; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I would like to review the progress we are making in executing our strategy, our key achievements for 2012 and our guidance for 2013. Greg Hill will then discuss our Exploration and Production business, and John Rielly will go over our financial results.","This past year has been one of significant change and progress for Hess. On our July call, we explained that Hess was in the midst of a 5-year transition to transform itself from an integrated oil and gas company to a predominately exploration and production company and shift its exploration and production growth strategy from one based primarily on high-impact exploration to one based on a combination of lower risk unconventionals, exploitation of existing discoveries and a smaller, more focused exploratory program.","On the first point, with the closure of our HOVENSA joint venture refinery in early 2012 and Monday's announcement that we will close our Port Reading, New Jersey refinery in February, Hess will have completely exited the Refining business. We also announced on Monday, after careful study, that we will seek to sell our terminal network along the U.S. East Coast in St. Lucia, as we believe we have the ability to access refined products from third parties to securely supply our Retail and Energy Marketing businesses. As a result of these actions, over 90% of Hess's capital employed will be in our Exploration and Production business.","We also have made significant progress in executing our Exploration and Production growth strategy. This three-pronged strategy, as you know, has been driven principally by our success in the Bakken Shale oil play in North Dakota, where we enjoy a leadership position. On our July call, we advised that at current oil prices, the significant upfront capital spend typical of unconventional shale oil development would likely result in a funding deficit of about $3 billion in 2012, moderate in 2013 due to lower spending and approach a balance in 2014. We also said that most, if not all, of these cumulative deficits would be funded by asset sales as the company rebalances its Exploration and Production portfolio in favor of lower risk, higher return and geographically more secure assets. Lastly, we stated that the new reserves and production base established as a consequence of these actions would be lower than it was before the divestitures, but our profitability on a per-unit basis would be higher.","Here is where we stand today. First, as to our funding needs. The actual shortfall in 2012 was approximately $2.5 billion. For 2013, we recently announced an 18% decrease in capital spending to $6.8 billion. This reduced level of spend is driven by lower well costs associated with our transition to pad drilling and decreased investments in infrastructure projects.","Our 2013 budget also includes a 30% drop in exploratory spend to $550 million, consistent with our strategy of pursuing a smaller, more focused exploratory program. For 2014, we continue to believe that at current prices, capital expenditures should more closely approach operating cash flow.","As to the reshaping of our portfolio, to date, we have announced divestitures totaling $2.4 billion, including our interest in the Bittern, Beryl and Schiehallion fields in the United Kingdom, the Snohvit Field in Norway and the ACG fields in Azerbaijan. In addition, we have also announced we are in the process of selling our Russian subsidiary, Samara-Nafta; and our Eagle Ford assets in Texas. Also, as previously mentioned, we plan to divest our terminal network, which in addition to its sales proceeds, should also allow us to release approximately $1 billion of working capital for redeployment to fund Hess's future growth opportunities.","Assuming the successful completion of these divestitures, we expect to more than cover our funding requirements, generating excess proceeds available to reduce our short-term debt. While these divestitures will complete the strategic reshaping of our portfolio, we will, in the normal course of business, continue to optimize and upgrade its composition in the future.","Looking back, last year was an important inflection point in the development and execution of Hess's long-term corporate strategy. However, looking forward, this year will also be important as we expect to complete our announced divestitures by year-end 2013 and in so doing, solidify this year's production and earnings base from which Hess will grow in the future.","We expect production in 2013 to average between 375,000 and 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This forecast assumes that the sale of Samara-Nafta, which produces approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, closes at the end of the year. However, excluding the contribution from assets planned for divestiture this year, our new base production level is expected to be in the range of 325,000 to 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In terms of 2014 production, we anticipate that the expected decrease in production resulting from our 2013 asset sales will be largely offset by increased production from the Bakken and the Valhall Field, as well as the start up of the Tubular Bells Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and North Malay Basin development.","With regard to our 2012 results, consolidated net income was $2.2 billion. Exploration and Production earned $2.4 billion, and Marketing and Refining earned $231 million. Compared to 2011, our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil sales volumes and improved Marketing and Refining results, which more than offset the negative impact of lower realized crude oil selling prices.","With regard to Exploration and Production, in 2012, we replaced 141% of production at an FD&A cost of approximately $38 per barrel. At year end, our proved reserves stood at 1.553 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and our reserve life was 10.3 years. Including last year's results, our 5-year average reserve replacement ratio was 148%, and our average FD&A cost is about $27 per barrel of oil equivalent.","In 2012, our crude oil and natural gas production was 406,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 10% increase from 2011. The increase resulted from the restoration of production in Libya and strong operating performance in the Bakken and across our portfolio.","In the Bakken Shale oil play in North Dakota, net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2012, up 87% year-over-year. In 2013, we forecast net production from the Bakken to average between 64,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have built a strong position in the Bakken, which is arguably one of the best shale oil plays in the world. In 2012, we drove our drilling and completion costs down by more than 30% during the course of the year while significantly increasing production.","In the fourth quarter, we transitioned the majority of our rigs to pad drilling, which will allow us to drive further improvement in capital efficiency and financial returns. Regarding developments, in the third quarter of 2012, we entered into an agreement with PETRONAS to develop 9 discovered natural gas fields offshore Peninsular Malaysia. The North Malay Basin project, in which Hess has a 50% interest and is the operator, is expected to commence production in the fourth quarter of 2013 at a net rate of approximately 40 million cubic feet per day and to increase to 125 million cubic feet per day in 2016.","Also, we continue to advance our Tubular Bells project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess has a 57% interest and is the operator. Production is planned to commence in mid-2014 at a net rate of 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In terms of our 2012 exploration results, we enjoyed considerable success offshore Ghana, where we have 6 discoveries to date on the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block, in which Hess has a 90% interest.","Our financial position remains strong. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio at year-end 2012 was 27%. This ratio is expected to improve in 2013 as our asset sales are completed. A strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating remain a priority to enable us to have the financial flexibility to fund future growth opportunities.","We are confident that our strategy of selling noncore assets and investing in lower-risk and higher-return projects in Exploration and Production is the right one and will produce profitable growth and create long-term value for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill.","Gregory P. Hill","Thank you, John. I'd like to give an update on our progress in the Bakken and the Utica unconventional shale plays, as well as Valhall and Exploration.","We made good progress in the Bakken during 2012. In the first half of the year, we transitioned from a higher cost 38-stage hybrid completion design to a lower cost sliding sleeve design. This, along with other efficiency gains, allowed us to drive our drilling and completion costs down by more than 30% over the course of the year from $13.4 million per well in the first quarter to $9.0 million in the fourth quarter.","Also in the fourth quarter of 2012, we transitioned the majority of our rigs from held-by-production drilling to pad drilling. This transition will enable us to drive further improvement in capital efficiency and financial returns. However, as we mentioned in our third quarter conference call, this process change will result in a onetime flattening to slightly declining production during the first half of 2013 as the number of new wells online will be skewed to the back half of the year.","In the first half of 2013, we plan to bring 70 wells to production, whereas, in the second half of 2013, we expect to bring 105 wells to production. Fourth quarter production from the Bakken averaged 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 68% from the fourth quarter of 2011. As John mentioned, full year 2012 averaged 56,000 barrels per day, up 87% from 2011. We expect 2013 net production to average between 64,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and for most of the growth to occur in the second half of the year.","Our 2013 capital budget for the Bakken is $2.2 billion versus $3.1 billion in 2012, a reduction of nearly 30%. The primary drivers for this decrease are lower drilling and completion costs and a lower level of infrastructure spend. We expect to operate a 14-rig program in 2013.","In 2012, we drilled 176 Hess-operated wells and completed 206. The average 30-day initial production rate for the wells we completed was 750 to 900 barrels of oil per day. Our estimated ultimate recovery per well averaged between 550,000 and 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well.","In 2013, we plan to drill 185 Hess-operated wells and complete 175, of which, approximately 2\/3 will target the Middle Bakken, and the remainder will target the Three Forks. With regard to our Bakken infrastructure, in April of 2012, we commissioned our Tioga crude oil rail loading facility, and in the second half of the year, we shipped an average of 41,000 barrels per day via rail to higher-value markets.","Our Tioga Gas Plant expansion project is targeted to be commissioned late in the fourth quarter of 2013, enabling us to capture more value from our own gas and third-party volumes, which will generate attractive returns and cash flow for shareholders.","In the Utica, we continue to appraise our position. We are encouraged by the results based on data from our own wells and industry wells. In 2012, we drilled 2 wells and completed one of those wells on our 100% owned acreage. This well, the NAC 3H-3, tested at a rate of 11 million cubic feet per day and is currently maintaining a rate of 4 million cubic feet per day under surface facility constraints.","On our CONSOL joint venture acreage, we drilled 2 Hess-operated wells and completed one of them. This well, the Athens 1H-24, tested at a rate of 13.9 million cubic feet per day and 1,056 barrels of condensate per day. In 2012, our joint venture partner, CONSOL, also drilled 8 wells, of which 4 were completed and 3 were tested. In 2013, we plan to drill 5 wells on our 100% owned acreage, and the joint venture is planning to drill 27 wells mainly concentrated in Harrison, Guernsey and Noble Counties.","Moving to the Valhall Field in Norway, in which Hess has a 64% interest, the field redevelopment project was completed earlier this month, and the operator resumed production on January 26 after being shut in since August of 2012. We expect Valhall net production to average between 24,000 and 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013, which is approximately double 2012 production of 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The majority of the activities going forward at Valhall will focus on development drilling to fully utilize platform capacity.","Regarding Exploration, as John said, we enjoyed considerable success in Ghana where we have 6 discoveries to date. As announced in December, our fifth discovery, the Pecan-1 well, encountered 245 feet of net oil pay in a Turonian-aged reservoir. In January of 2013, we completed drilling our sixth discovery, the Cob prospect, results of which are being kept confidential due to it being a lease line well.","Also in January, we spudded the Pecan north #1 well, which is located approximately 7 miles north of Pecan-1 and is expected to reach TD in February, targeting Turonian-aged oil reservoirs. We have begun predevelopment activities and plan to submit an appraisal plan to the government in the third quarter.","Drilling activities were also completed on 2 outside operated exploration wells, Ness Deep #1 [ph] in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, operated by BHP; and Ajek-1 in Indonesia, operated by Niko Resources. Both wells encountered noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons and were expensed in the fourth quarter.","In Kurdistan, we are continuing our seismic acquisition on the Dinarta and Shakrok blocks and plan to spud 2 wells in the second half of 2013. Hess has an 80% interest in these blocks and is the operator.","In closing, our focus in 2013 will be on executing our strategic plan, improving capital efficiency and delivering higher financial returns.","I will now hand the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare fourth quarter 2012 results to the third quarter. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $566 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $557 million in the third quarter. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the corporation had earnings of $409 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $495 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production reported earnings of $517 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $608 million in the third quarter. Excluding items affecting comparability, Exploration and Production had income of $431 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $546 million in the third quarter.","Fourth quarter results included an after-tax gain of $172 million related to the sale of the corporation's interest in the Bittern Field and an income tax charge of $86 million for a disputed application of an international tax treaty. Third quarter results included net after-tax income of $62 million from items affecting comparability of earnings between periods.","Excluding these items, the changes in the after-tax components of the results were as follows: higher natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $43 million; lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $32 million; higher exploration expenses, primarily for dry hole expenses, decreased earnings by $110 million; all other items net to a decrease in earnings of $16 million for an overall decrease in fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $115 million.","Our E&P operations were underlifted in the quarter compared with production, resulting in decreased after-tax income of approximately $30 million. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was 45% for the full year of 2012.","Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining generated income of $159 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $53 million in the third quarter. Marketing earnings were $152 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $17 million in the third quarter. Fourth quarter marketing results included after-tax income of $104 million from the partial liquidation of LIFO inventories, partly offset by after-tax charges totaling $33 million for asset impairments and other charges.","Fourth quarter marketing results also reflect the impact of higher margins. Port Reading refining operations reported income of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $18 million in the third quarter, principally due to lower margins. Operating activities generated a loss of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with earnings of $18 million in the third quarter.","Turning to Corporate. Net Corporate expenses were $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $38 million in the third quarter. After-tax interest expense was $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, which was comparable with the third quarter.","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter, including an increase of $443 million from changes in working capital, was $1,570,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,779,000,000. Proceeds from the sale of Bittern were $187 million. Net borrowings were $246 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $110 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $114 million.","We had $642 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 and $351 million at December 31, 2011. Total debt was $8,111,000,000 at December 31, 2012 and $6,057,000,000 at December 31, 2011. The Corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at December 31, 2012, was 27.5% compared with 24.6% at the end of 2011. This ratio is expected to improve in 2013 as our asset sales are completed.","With our 2013 capital program and the uncertain financial markets, we thought it prudent to have some price insurance. Therefore, in January, we hedged 55,000 barrels per day for the remainder of 2013 at an average Brent price of $108.50 per barrel.","Turning to 2013 guidance. In addition to the 2013 production and capital expenditure guidance provided by John Hess, I would like to provide estimates for certain 2013 metrics based on our expected production range of 375,000 to 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For full year 2013 unit cost, E&P cash operating costs are expected to be in the range of $21 to $22 per barrel of oil equivalent produced. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses are expected to be in the range of $19 to $20 per barrel for total production unit cost of $40 to $42.","For the full year of 2013, we expect our E&P effective tax rate to be in the range of 46% to 50%. Net Corporate expenses in 2013 are estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. We expect our 2013 after-tax interest expense to be in the range of $255 million to $265 million.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, first of all, I think you guys should be congratulated in the progress you've delivered in the last year or so. However, obviously, there's a lot of news of -- clearly, an activist involved now. Could you share your thoughts not specifically about their suggestions in terms of business strategy, but more about their proposals for the board constitution? Any thoughts you could share there, please? And then, I have a follow-up on Production.","John B. Hess","Yes, no, I think it's important to just make a point here. We look at everything to enhance long-term shareholder value. We have no sacred cows in the business. We have no sacred cows in the boardroom. It should be obvious that we have made a lot of moves with a multiyear strategy to put our company in a position to generate long-term shareholder value, that we look at things for all shareholders' benefit. And as a consequence, we're happy to discuss with shareholders their ideas. And specifically, in terms of Elliott's proposals, we're looking carefully at them and the presentation. We will have a response to that presentation in a short period of time. But this earnings call is not the appropriate forum to respond to Elliott.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. My follow-up, John, is I just wanted to try and understand what you're trying to tell us about production, and maybe I'm being a little dumb here, but could you walk us through what, essentially, the sequential growth that you expect between '13 and '14, excluding the asset sales? Because if I heard you right, you're basically -- and maybe, I'll let you answer the question, but it sounds like you're suggesting the flat production before adjusting for disposals. In other words, up around 40,000 barrels a day year-over-year. Could you just give us some help us to how we get through that math?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Doug, I think -- thanks for the question. I think the way that John said in his opening remarks really kind of characterized what we were trying to say. So if you back the sales out, so you rebase the company. What John said is, in terms of 2014 production, we expect that the increase -- or the decrease in production resulting from those sales is going to be largely offset by the increased production from the Bakken and the Valhall Field, the start up of Tubular Bells and the North Malay Basin developments.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So what is that number, Greg?","Gregory P. Hill","We're not giving guidance yet, Doug, on 2014 but obviously, you can get close by what I just said.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","With the announced terminal sales, potential sale earlier in the week, should we draw any conclusions on your intent to form an MLP? I know it's been a topic on the last 2 earnings calls. I know there is infrastructure assets that you will need to control, primarily, in the Bakken, maybe gas plant ramping up in 4Q that you discussed and owning a GP -- an MLP would achieve that control. Yet with this sale to a potential third party, you lose some MLP-able EBITDA. So I mean, we should read anything into this sale and your potential intent to utilize that structure?","John B. Hess","No. Obviously, we're going to look at all strategic options to maximize value in terms of the divestiture of our terminal network in the United States. Most likely, it will be as outright sale. I think it's important that we will take the appropriate steps to ensure supply, security, competitive prices and to maintain the high quality service for our customers in Retail and Energy Marketing businesses, which are very profitable and a good source of U.S. income. But at the end of the day, we're just starting the sale process for those terminals. And obviously, when we have a transaction completed, we'll give you an update on that. So all options are on the table, but most likely, we're looking at an outright cash sale. So I think it's important to understand that for our terminal network divestiture. In terms of an MLP in the Bakken for our infrastructure, this is not new. This idea, it's been in the industry for some time. We've done study on it, constantly. We're very aware of the benefits that it might create. And so as a consequence, if it makes sense to create long-term shareholder value, it will be given serious consideration. But we certainly do not believe that an MLP in the Bakken is appropriate at this time.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And I appreciate that. A follow-up, I know that you've been reshaping the portfolio over the year and into 2013, kind of comprehensive update this morning. But did I understand your comments that the major portion of this will be completed following the sale of Russia, Eagle Ford and the terminals; and that other potential sales will be more in the ordinary course of portfolio management. So I guess the question is, do we largely know all the larger moving pieces at this juncture? Is that a fair statement?","John B. Hess","I absolutely -- that is a correct understanding of my remarks, that the major moves to reshape our portfolio in terms of divestiture to complete the strategic reshaping of our portfolio will have been completed by the end of 2013, but I think it has to be very clear. We have, we'll continue to do so and currently look at all opportunities to enhance long-term shareholder value for our shareholders. There are no sacred cows. It should be obvious by our behavior over the last several years, as it is most recently, and we will in the normal course of business continue to look at opportunities to optimize and upgrade our portfolio in the future.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","John, one interesting question that's been raised is whether it's a good idea to mix the global business with the domestic business. Can you just remind us what the global footprint mix the Bakken growth gives you and what kind of competitive advantage you have in that particular area? And could you continue into the subject of exploration, how that's gone and very specifically, finally, on a positive note, talk a little bit more about Ghana?","John B. Hess","We've been clear. We're very proud of the global portfolio we have. We definitely believe that our three-pronged strategy -- we had been too focused on high-impact exploration, which we've addressed by cutting it way back, giving it more focus. Greg talked about it. Obviously, some good news in Ghana. We can talk about that a little bit more. Greg will address that. But our strategy now of balancing and combining low-risk unconventionals, exploitation of existing discoveries, such as the North Malay Basin gas development that we're in. And the smaller, more focused exploratory program is the right strategy. It's being recognized, obviously, in the market, and our key objective now is to stay focused on executing it to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. So the global reach and balance, some of those assets in our conventional portfolio generate the cash needed to fund the unconventional growth that we have in the Bakken and the Utica. And just having the Bakken and Utica stand alone, they would not be self-funding. They could not get access to the credit markets, and that's a real issue. So this balanced approach we definitely think is the right one that will create the most returns, financial returns for our shareholders over the long term. So we feel very good about our global portfolio. We feel very good about the balance of unconventionals and conventionals from a financial return perspective and a funding perspective. And I think the strategy is being recognized. I think another point to bring out here, Paul, is that in these divestitures, we've gotten rid of about 1\/3 of our assets. So often, when -- hidden in your question could be you're global, you're too spread out. Well, actually, Hess has brought down the focus considerably of the portfolio of assets that we have. So we're very, very comfortable that we can manage it, that we can execute it, and we can deliver long-term shareholder value from it. So hopefully, that gives you some perspective on both the global portfolio and the benefits of it in terms of diversifying risk and maximizing return and also, having the funding that we need for the unconventionals. But also, that we have much more focus to our portfolio that, hopefully, will be recognized by investors. And we believe that, that strategy is the right one, and it's being recognized. And I might turn the call just over -- about exploration, one, what we're doing in exploration but two, more specifically the focus that we have there and talk about Ghana a little bit.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, thanks, John. Again, just to reiterate what John said, we've been refocusing exploration, and we've significantly reduced investment. We're at $550 million of investments this year, focused on our 3 primary areas: the Gulf of Mexico; Southeast Asia, Malaysia in particular and then also, the West Africa play, which Ghana is clearly a part of. As I said in my kind of opening remarks about Ghana, we've got 6 discoveries under our belt on Ghana. December, our fifth discovery came out, which was the Pecan-1 well, which had 245 feet of pay and Turonian pay. And then, in January, we announced the Cob well, which was another discovery. So that brought our discovery count again to 6. Now we can't talk much about Cob just because it's a lease line well. So we have to stay confidential for now. In fact, our competitors are in the midst of drilling the adjacent well on the lease line. And so the last well that we're currently going to drill in 2013, we're on right now, and we expect to reach a TD in February, and that's north of the Pecan-1 well, which was a big discovery, the big Turonian oil discovery, and that again, is targeting Turonian-aged oil reservoirs. So we're in predevelopment studies now. So we're looking at all of these discoveries and how are we going to develop all these. We plan to file an appraisal plan with the government mid-year. So we're progressing Ghana. We don't expect to drill any more wells in 2013, most likely, if any more drilling, appraisal -- drilling will be in 2014.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Are you still pursuing that partner there?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we will. Yes, we will. That's, again, part of our stated strategy in Exploration, to continue to partner these things. Obviously, now we have significant discoveries, so our partnering strategy, we'll pick the right kind of partner to help us with that.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, just a brief other question on Russia. Is there anything you can add about that disposal given its size and importance to how we look at volumes for the year?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, I think as John said in his opening remarks, Russia currently makes about 50,000 barrels a day, and that's about what it's projected to make in 2013.","John B. Hess","Yes, and specifically, in terms of the sale, when we can give you an update on the progress or the consummation of it, we will.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","We're clearly seeing some of the signs of progress in terms of reshaping, which we like. Just as people focus on the Bakken, I mean, obviously, you've worked there for a while. At this point, would you have an estimate of, say, acreage that you think is in the core or perhaps, even -- and this might be a long shot, the economic well inventory that you have across the Bakken and Three Forks at $100 per barrel Brent?","Gregory P. Hill","All right. I think on the acreage, as we've said before, we've got between 550,000 and 600,000 net acres that we call core in the Bakken. Our acreage count is actually higher, but we think that 550,000 to 600,000 is really the core part of the play. As far as wells, a lot of it depends upon infill spacing. All those questions that are still being answered as we speak. But eventually, it'll be in the order of 2,000 to 3,000 wells buildout in the Bakken. So obviously, very significant drilling and completion programs.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then, just on -- you said complete reshaping, which makes sense. But say, the wells are collapsing oil prices and you still wanted to fund, and maybe, the debt markets' closed up and you were looking to sell further international assets beyond what you've already identified, have you looked at -- would tax leakage be a constraint on further asset sales?","John P. Rielly","No, they would not, Ed.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and just a final one. Any actual resource estimate for Ghana from what you've drilled so far that you could release?","Gregory P. Hill","No, not yet. We really want to get this next well down and importantly, get our predevelopment study done because there's a number of accumulations on the block, how they tie back, which ones you can tie back, et cetera. So we don't have a commercial estimate yet.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just conceptually, you've stated in the past your preference to retain the field distribution assets for now. Since there is very little precedent in the industry for essentially, in E&P pure play with a fuel marketing division, can you just talk about the logic for retaining that as opposed to spin-off for sale?","John B. Hess","Yes, just to be clear, it's not a fuel marketing business. If it were just a fuel marketing business, we probably wouldn't have kept it. But we have morphed our fuel marketing business into an Energy Marketing business, where the same customer that might -- and these are commercial industrial accounts, about 22,000 of them from Massachusetts down to South Carolina across to Ohio, where we sell -- we're currently selling over 1.5 billion cubic feet a day of gas, which obviously, will help us if we find gas in Utica and certainly put us in a good position so we wouldn't have to discount that gas. So there are going to be some strategic benefits there, and we also sell 4,500 megawatt hours around the clock to those customers as well. It's a very profitable business. It makes, I'd say, very acceptable strong returns. So the fact that it's U.S. income, it gives us some marketing capability. We have a strong brand. We think, that if anything, it enhances the company from a financial and reputational point of view.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can I also just get a quick update on your plans for Kurdistan this year?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I mean, we're shooting seismic, and we plan to drill 2 wells in 2013, one on the Shakrok block and one on the Dinarta block.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Mei from Tudor, Pickering.","Brandon Mei - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","On the Bakken, can you provide a split in production for 4Q actual and '13 guidance for the operated and non-operated portion?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I can. So I can give you 2012 actuals. If you look at operated production, fourth quarter was about 55,000 barrels a day of operated. Outside operated, it was about 9.5. That brings you to the 64.5 for the quarter.","Brandon Mei - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and what about 2013 guidance?","Gregory P. Hill","You can assume a similar split.","Brandon Mei - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then on a similar basis, give a split on CapEx.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Next year, we'll spend about $150 million in outside operated wells in capital, and the balance being on our own account.","Brandon Mei - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then, my final question is on -- do you have a debt-to-cap target? And then, I guess, if you are in a position where you meet that target, can you just walk through the pecking order of investment opportunities that could attract capital?","John B. Hess","Yes, I think the most important thing there is, we want to have a strong investment grade rating, and we want to pay off the debt that we've incurred as we've made this transition into unconventionals and get our strong balance sheet back. And as John Rielly reflected, by the end of 2013, we should be there. And then, it's going to be a function, looking forward, at attractive investment opportunities, current returns to shareholders and getting the balance right. As it turns out, our company is a growth company and has very attractive investments. They have to compete for capital. They have to meet our 15% hurdle rate, meaning, meet or exceed our 15% hurdle rate of $100 Brent. And I wouldn't want to speculate on where we're going to be investing the money a year from now until some of the investment growth opportunities we have, have more time to mature such as the Utica, potentially Ghana, potentially [indiscernible] in the deepwater Gulf.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, let me just come back to your question on the Bakken, just to be clear, in 2013. So if you look at the capital spend next year in the Bakken, the external guidance was 2.2, about $500 million of that is facilities. So that's a significant reduction from last year. About $1.4 billion or so or $1.5 billion is owned wells, and the rest is outside operated, and we have a small amount of land and seismic and studying money in there as well. I just wanted to make that clear.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Two quick ones for me on the Bakken. With the Three Forks, Greg, are you going to be pursuing that earlier or later in the year versus the Middle Bakken number?","Gregory P. Hill","We're actually going to where the best wells are. So we have some outstanding wells in the Three Forks, and they're just going to be part of our normal mix of wells. We're doing very -- a very small amount of appraisal work in the Three Forks so that most of the Three Forks drilling next year is in proven high-profitability, high-return areas.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. I know you said that you've finished the HBP nature of your drilling program. Have you given any thought to piloting a higher-density programs or greater-density programs?","Gregory P. Hill","Well as you know, as we've said before, we do have an ongoing close-space pilot in the Middle Bakken. We plan to continue that pilot into this year, and so again, the spacing varies by the drilling unit depending on the quality of the rock and all those factors. So there won't be a generic spacing that you can say for the Bakken. It's really going to depend upon the quality of the rock at the end of the day.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Yes, I was just shooting for whether or not you'd go for greater density. Okay, the last question for me is with respect to both Port Reading and the terminal length. Are there any environmental tails or liabilities that we should be concerned of or aware about?","John P. Rielly","No, there are not.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the exploration expense, which you're taking down to about $550 million this year, and you've talked about rightsizing that. Is this still a transition year where we can expect further reductions in the years ahead, or do you view that as kind of an appropriately sized program for a company of your size?","Gregory P. Hill","I think, in general, for now, that's an appropriate size program. Guidance in 2014, obviously, we can't give. I will say, part of that will depend upon Ghana.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And, Greg, do you have any update on your long-term targets there? I think it was 120,000 barrels a day out 5 years, but wondering if you had updated thoughts on that.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think 120,000 barrels a day remains our goal. It'll largely be a function of our investment levels, which in turn are, obviously, are function of oil prices and competing investment opportunities in the portfolio.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Do you want to keep a year to that target, or is that just a generic goal based on the factors you just mentioned?","Gregory P. Hill","No, I think we've said before, mid-decade is kind of our goal.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones, if I may. I guess, they're both for John Rielly. John, deferred taxes. How should we think about -- you've given us a tax rate, but can you talk about Norway? Can you talk about the tax position in the U.S.? And in answering the question, can you tell us what the current status is of Retail in terms of whether you spun it or not, how would that change your IDC allowances? And I've got a quick follow-up, please.","John P. Rielly","Sure, Doug. So for Norway, we don't expect to be paying cash taxes in Norway until 2015. So over the next several years, our cash taxes will be fairly low, and I'm going beyond '15 with that. As you look in the U.S., and I think your particular question is about the IDC cost and how they're deducted and whether as an integrated, you have a 70% limit; and if you're not integrated, you have 100% ability to take all the IDCs. Yes, with our closure of HOVENSA, actually, the way the rules work, we actually exited the refining business under the rules during 2012. And then, so long as we have a structure to where the Marketing business that we have on the downstream side is segregated from the E&P operations, you are allowed -- then we are not classified as an integrated. And therefore, we can get 100% on the IDC deduction. So starting right at the beginning of 2013, we have the 100% IDC deduction, and so there's nothing else that we need to do to attain that.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just to be clear, do you still get to have the tax shield on the U.S. earnings from Retail coming from the E&P?","John P. Rielly","Absolutely, yes. So, I mean, we have excess deductions being generated out of the Bakken that we can use in Retail and our other U.S. assets.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And my follow-up, I don't know who wants to take this one, but can you quantify the level of interest in the Eagle Ford and Russia in terms of drilling [ph] activity and so on, and I'll leave it there.","John B. Hess","Yes, there's strong interest on both, Doug. So that's, I think, as far as we can go. And once the sale process consummates, we'll inform you to the outcome.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R.

Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

I will now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will view progress in executing our strategy in the current low oil price environment and provide some highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will discuss our operating performance and John Rielly will then review our financial results.","The three key principles that guide us are to preserve the strength of our balance sheet, preserve our capabilities, and preserve our growth options. We have moved aggressively over the course of 2015 to reduce our costs, capturing about $600 million in reductions so far, split evenly between capital expenditures and cash operating costs.","For 2016, we intend to significantly reduce our level of spending in order to preserve our balance sheet and liquidity. While our 2016 budgeting process will not be finalized until the end of the year, we currently expect next year's E&P capital and exploratory expenditures to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion compared to $4.1 billion in 2015, excluding expenditures associated with a 50% interest in our Bakken Midstream joint venture. This reduction of more than $1 billion represents approximately a 27% decrease from 2015.","In the Bakken, we are currently planning to operate four rigs in 2016. We dropped one rig in the third quarter and plan to operate seven rigs for the balance of this year. We also plan to curtail investment in our offshore assets in 2016. We intend to defer further development drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, and in Equatorial Guinea. In addition, we will complete a major booster compression project at the JDA in the first half of 2016, which will reduce our spend there next year.","In terms of our financial position, we have one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions within our peer group. At September 30, our net debt-to-capitalization ratio, excluding the Bakken Midstream joint venture, was 13% and we had nearly $8 billion of available liquidity including $3 billion of cash. In 2016, we expect to fund our base business expenditures and dividends through cash flow from operations and use cash on the balance sheet to fund our growth investments, which include two development projects and exploration and appraisal activities. While it is prudent to plan for continued low oil prices in 2016, we also believe that Hess is well positioned to benefit when oil prices recover. We are more leveraged to liquids than our peers, with industry-leading cash margins. Also, our advantaged tax positions in the United States and Norway will accelerate cash flow growth as oil prices improve.","Our portfolio has significant growth opportunities; in the near-term, from the Bakken and Utica; in the intermediate term, from new field start-ups at North Malay Basin in 2017 and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in 2018; and in the longer term, recent material exploration discoveries at Liza in Guyana and Sicily in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico provide significant upside potential for our shareholders. Both of these discoveries are planned to be appraised in early 2016.","Now turning to our financial results. In the third quarter of 2015, we posted a net loss of $279 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $291 million, or $1.03 per share, compared to net income of $1.24 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, our financial results were primarily impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices, which more than offset the impact of higher crude oil and natural gas sales volumes, and lower cash costs and exploration expense.","During the third quarter, we again delivered strong operating performance. Net production averaged 380,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 21% from the year-ago quarter, excluding Libya. This improvement was driven by higher production from the Bakken and Utica shale plays and the Tubular Bells Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In light of our continued strong performance, we are increasing our forecast for 2015 full-year production to a range of 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from our previous guidance of 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This increase represents a 16% to 18% improvement over 2014, excluding Libya.","In the fourth quarter of 2015, we forecast production to average approximately 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Based on 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion, our preliminary forecast is, for 2016 production, to be in the range of 330,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Turning to the Bakken. Production averaged 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, above our guidance range. For the full year 2015, we now expect production to average approximately 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our previous guidance of a range of 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we forecast production to average approximately 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Based on our current plans for a four-rig program next year, our preliminary forecast for Bakken production is to average in the range of 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In summary, we delivered strong operating performance while maintaining a robust financial and liquidity position. With further significant spending reductions underway, we are well positioned in the current low oil price environment and are taking a disciplined approach to preserve our financial strength, competitively advantaged capabilities, and long-term growth options.","I will now turn the call over to Greg.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thank you, John. I'd like to provide an operational update and review overall progress in executing our strategy. We believe strongly that it's prudent to plan for continued low oil prices next year and prioritize preserving the strength of our balance sheet. In this light, we are planning further significant reductions in our capital and exploratory expenditures in 2016. In the Bakken, we plan to operate a four-rig program next year compared to 8.5 rigs in 2015 and 17 rigs in 2014. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we plan to defer further development drilling at the Tubular Bells and Llano Fields. In the North Sea, we will complete the current drilling program at the Hess-operated South Arne Field in Denmark in the first quarter of 2016, and will then release the rig and defer further drilling.","In Equatorial Guinea, where demobilization of the rig was completed during the third quarter of this year, we will defer drilling in 2016 to allow time for processing and interpretation of new 4D seismic. At the Valhall Field in Norway, the operator plans to leave the platform rig stacked over the majority of 2016. And at the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, we will complete a major booster compression project in the first half of 2016, after which capital for the rest of the year will be significantly reduced. As John mentioned, when oil prices recover, we are competitively well positioned and have both the capabilities and the opportunities to drive future profitable growth.","Now, turning to the third quarter of 2015. We delivered strong operating performance across our portfolio, further improved our onshore drilling costs, and progressed our offshore developments and exploration activities.","Starting with production. In the third quarter, we averaged 380,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, exceeding our previous guidance of 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, reflecting strong performance from our producing assets. As a result, we have raised our full-year 2015 production guidance to between 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.","On this same basis, we forecast production in the fourth quarter to average approximately 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our fourth quarter forecast reflects the impact of lower activity levels across our portfolio.","Turning to unconventionals. In the third quarter, production from the Bakken averaged 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, and 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. High production availability and strong well performance allowed us to exceed our previous guidance of 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter.","In the third quarter, we operated an average of seven rigs in the Bakken and brought 48 wells online. In 2015, we expect to drill 183 wells, complete 212, and bring 219 online, with an average of 8.5 rigs for the year. This compares to last year, when we drilled 261 wells, completed 230, and brought 238 wells online, with an average of 17 rigs. For the drilling rigs alone, this represents a 40% efficiency improvement year-on-year as result of the application of our distinctive lean manufacturing capability.","In the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken production to continue to move modestly lower and average between 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting fewer new wells being brought online. For the full year 2015, we expect Bakken production to average approximately 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is at the upper-end of the guidance range announced on our second quarter call.","Through lean manufacturing, we continue to drive Bakken drilling and completion costs lower. In the third quarter, our D&C costs averaged $5.3 million per well, versus $5.6 million in the second quarter, and $7.2 million in the year-ago quarter. With these low costs and by drilling some of the highest productivity wells in the play, we continue to generate some of the highest returns in the Bakken. Despite moving to four rigs, we expect to hold production in 2016 relatively flat with fourth quarter 2015 guidance through a combination of efficiency gains, including lower spud-to-spud days, higher well and facility availability and by capturing more NGLs and natural gas at the gas plant.","Our preliminary 2016 forecast is to bring approximately 100 new wells online with production averaging between 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As a reminder, substantially, all of our Bakken acreage is held by production and assuming a four-rig program at current strip prices and well costs, we retain a greater than 10-year inventory of drilling locations that can generate after-tax returns of 15% or higher. In total, we have more than 3,000 future drilling locations in the Bakken. And, as prices recover, we will increase our rig count and activity level as appropriate.","Moving to the Utica. In the third quarter, the joint venture drilled five wells, completed five, and brought 11 on production. Net production for the third quarter averaged 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter and 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2015. For the full year 2015, we expect Utica production to be at the upper-end of our guidance range of 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Turning to offshore. At the Tubular Bells Field in the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. During the quarter, we experienced a mechanical issue related to a sub-surface safety valve that is stuck in the closed position as well as wellbore skin effects at two producing wells. While these issues are not unusual in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, it will require sub-surface well intervention work in the coming months. As a result, we have now lowered our full year 2015 forecast to approximately 20,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. However, we expect production to be higher in 2016 as a result of this remediation work.","At the Stampede development project in the Gulf of Mexico in which Hess holds a 25% working interest in as operator, fabrication work continues on both the TLP hull and topsides. Drilling is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2016 with first oil targeted for 2018. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest in as operator, third quarter net production averaged 39 million cubic feet per day through the early production system and is expected to remain at around 40 million cubic feet per day through 2016. In the third quarter, we progressed fabrication of the central processing platform, which is part of the full field development project. The project is on schedule to be completed in 2017, and is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day.","In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. Planned maintenance activities have been successfully completed, and we continue to expect full year 2015 net production to be in the range of 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Moving to exploration. On the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana, where Hess holds a 30% working interest, we believe Liza, which logged 295 feet of high-quality oil-bearing reservoir, is a significant oil discovery. The operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, plans to drill an appraisal well in the first quarter of 2016, and is currently completing preparatory technical work and developing drilling plans. We're encouraged by the potential of the Stabroek Block, which is approximately the size of 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. Over 50% of a new 17,000 square kilometer 3D seismic shoot has now been completed, and we're evaluating both potential development options for Liza, as well as the additional resource potential on the block.","In the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to evaluate the results of the Chevron-operated Sicily discovery, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest. An appraisal well to further evaluate the discovery is planned to spud later this year.","In closing, I'm very pleased with our team, who once again achieved strong operational performance in the current low oil price environment amid significant changes in activity.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $291 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $147 million in the second quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, the corporation incurred a net loss of $279 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared with a net loss of $567 million in the second quarter of 2015.","Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred losses of $221 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $96 million in the second quarter of 2015. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the third quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2015 were as follows. Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $143 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $33 million. Lower cash operating costs improved results by $15 million. Lower exploration expenses improved results by $9 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $9 million. All other items net to an improvement in results of $18 million for an overall reduction in third quarter adjusted results of $125 million.","In the third quarter, our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 100,000 barrels, which had no significant impact on our financial results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 47% for the third quarter of 2015. This effective rate was favorable to the top end of our guidance range by 2% and primarily resulted from the mix of income generated by operations during the quarter. The E&P effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2015 was a benefit of 56%.","Turning to Midstream. On July 1, we formed the Bakken Midstream joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partners by selling a 50% interest that generated after-tax proceeds of approximately $3 billion, including the corporation's share of debt proceeds issued by the joint venture at formation. Following the completion of this sale, the corporation will fully consolidate the operating results, assets and liabilities of the Bakken Midstream segment in its consolidated financial statements with our partner's share being reflected as a non-controlling interest. The Bakken Midstream segment had net income of $16 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared with $32 million in the second quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of the 50% non-controlling interest. Bakken Midstream EBITDA, excluding non-controlling interest, amounted to $79 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $74 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to Corporate and Interest. After-tax corporate and interest expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were $86 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $83 million in the second quarter of 2015.","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter including a decrease of $207 million from changes in working capital was $282 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $963 million. Proceeds from dispositions amounted to $2.667 billion. Borrowings were $600 million. Distribution of loan proceeds to our joint venture partner were $300 million. Repayments of debt were $17 million. Common stock dividends paid were $71 million. Common stock acquired and retired amounted to $64 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $52 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $2.082 billion.","Turning to our financial position. Excluding amounts held in our Bakken Midstream joint venture, we had approximately $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015, compared to $1 billion at June 30, 2015. Total debt, excluding Bakken Midstream, was $6 billion at September 30, 2015, and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 22.7%.","Now let me update you on changes to our 2015 guidance. We now project cash costs for E&P operations to be in a range of $16 per barrel of oil equivalent to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter, and $15.50 per barrel to $16 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $16.50 per barrel to $17.50 per barrel. DD&A per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2015 is forecast to be $29 per barrel to $30 per barrel and $28.50 per barrel to $29 per barrel for the full year of 2015, versus previous guidance of $28.50 per barrel to $29.50 per barrel. This results in updated projected total E&P unit costs of $45 per barrel to $47 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $44 per barrel to $45 per barrel for the full year of 2015.","The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.80 per barrel of oil equivalent to $3.90 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter of 2015, and $3.35 per barrel of oil equivalent to $3.45 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2015.","Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs and items affecting comparability, are expected to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million in the fourth quarter, and $340 million to $350 million for the full year, which is down from previous full-year guidance of $380 million to $400 million.","Turning to Midstream. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, will be in the range of $15 million to $20 million.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. First question really around the cash cycle. I mean, I like what you're doing with the capital discipline. Obviously, you've got Stampede and North Malay that you have to complete. But as you look to the other side of it when you get to sort of 2017, where do you sort of see cash neutrality for where cash flow covering CapEx and dividend heads out, given cost deflation and activity choices?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Thanks, Ed. So, I mean, as we look at it, first of all, let me just discuss I guess 2016. Our budget has not been finalized yet. So as you look at 2016, and I think it's exactly as you said, we do expect to cover our base business expenditures and dividends through our cash flow from operations, and even at this low commodity price environment. And then, we'll use the cash on the balance sheet as needed to fund our growth projects in 2016, which include North Malay Basin and Stampede and our exploration and appraisal activities, which Greg mentioned.","So then, as you move on to 2017, North Malay Basin comes online. So North Malay Basin becomes a cash flow generator and increases our production in 2017. And then, Stampede comes on in 2018, becomes a cash flow generator in 2018. So as we look at this, and I think in going through the cycle, we're just balancing everything that we've talking about, preserving that financial strength, keeping these operating capabilities and preserving these growth options so that as we move through 2017 and 2018, we're in a good position to begin to start generating cash flow at that point in time.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then, one of the big exciting areas obviously is Liza. You've got to do appraisal. I don't know how many prospects you've actually managed to map on the block at this stage, but maybe talk a little bit about how aggressive you're going to get after the exploration phase, and then maybe even early production on the field.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, so I guess a little context first. The Liza, a very significant discovery, again, it's 295 feet of very high quality sandstone. And importantly, the well also proved that there's a working petroleum system on this very large block, which is about 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. Now, Ed, we're about 50% complete with a seismic shoot that covers over 70% of that block; it's about a 17,000 square kilometer shoot. So we're about half done.","So the next step, obviously, is to complete that seismic. We're also planning appraisal and exploration drilling next year with the operator. We haven't finalized all that yet, so I can't really be specific. But there's two objectives: appraise Liza and then get started on other exploration prospects on the block. There's numerous lookalikes to Liza, for example.","And then the third thing we're going to do is we're starting to evaluate potential Liza development options. So how would we develop this significant development called Liza. So those are kind of the three things that are going on.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I've got a couple of questions on the capital budget also. John, how much of this $3 billion midpoint guidance is what you'd characterize as non-producing capital, exploration and those large projects at this point?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So, first off, as you know, right, just in light of this low oil price environment, we wanted to get this preliminary 2016's guidance out on our capital and exploratory program. It is difficult at this point, because we haven't completed our budget process, to be really specific on our numbers, just in general across our portfolio. And we will do that in January. At a high level, though, we're going to be continuing to spend on North Malay Basin and Stampede, and you can think about it in the general same area as it was in 2015. But we will provide specifics on that in 2016. And then exploration, we'll have to provide \u2013 as Greg said, there's still \u2013 we still have work to do on Guyana \u2013 we'll provide more information on that in January of 2016. But I guess, if you put it altogether, it shouldn't be that much different than the growth capital that we were spending this year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, just to be clear, North Malay and Stampede have got about $900 million this year. And exploration, I guess, is about $400 million to $500 million. So is it reasonable to think about it as roughly about half your spending next year is not contributing to production?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yes, that is reasonable. Again \u2013 so the way I would call it, Doug, it's not contributing to production next year, but obviously we're building this portfolio, and we're: one, adding resources to the portfolio with North Malay Basin and Stampede, which will become cash flow generators in 2017 and 2018. And then, as Greg has mentioned, we're excited about the potential of adding future resources for Guyana, so we've got that long-term resources being added to our portfolio.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. So I guess swinging to the Bakken then. What I'm really trying to understand is what four rigs means for the Bakken. So I guess I'm not even quite sure how to ask this question. If these four rigs stabilize the production on an exit-to-exit basis once you get to the end of 2016, and if I'm thinking about this right, when you get done with those major capital projects, leaving aside what happens in Guyana, does that non-productive capital, if you like, then swing back to what are still probably some of the highest return assets in your portfolio? In other words, do you go back to a 14-rig, 15-rig program in the Bakken towards the end of the decade as our capital frees up? Is that how we should think about it?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, so first of all, Doug, what happens to the Bakken, as we kind of said in our opening remarks, with a four-rig program in 2016, we expect the Bakken to stay roughly flat with Q4 2015. So that would add \u2013 we've guided 95,000 barrels a day to 105,000 barrels a day for 2016. Now, the obvious question is, well, how can we hold production flat with four rigs? And it's really three ways. Increase drilling efficiencies and higher availability on existing production because there's less SIMOPS going on. And then increased gas and NGL capture in plant. Now, if you project out further and ask, how long can we hold production flat in a four-rig case? We could do that for several years. So we could hold Bakken at about 100,000 barrels a day for several years just with the four-rig program. And obviously, as cash flow becomes free, as we swing off these growth projects, where we divert that capital will be a function of return obviously. But clearly, the Bakken is one of the best projects we have in our portfolio, so it'll be very high in the queue for a future call on capital.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Last quick one, Greg, if I may. Just there's been some talk of Exxon moving to an early production system in Liza. Can you offer any comments on scale and timing?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Can't really, Doug. The one thing I will say is that we're in preliminary studies to evaluate what might be development options for Liza B, and there's a variety of possibilities there.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks a lot, everybody.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber with Simmons. Your line is now open.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, everybody, and thanks for providing the initial 2016 guidance for us. We appreciate it. First one, just I apologize if I missed this, but what commodity price framework are you assuming in the $3 billion preliminary capital guidance? Would that be something close to the strip?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yes. Yes. We're looking at current prices, right.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Great. And then you mentioned curtailing the offshore spend, deferring further development drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea EG. Can you just discuss that thought process? We typically would think of infill wells as some of the higher-return opportunities for you, out of Tubular Bells, for example, where you've already invested some of the infrastructure. So just want to understand how you're thinking about that, how you came to that decision?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I think, again, you have to go back to the opening remarks of both John and I, and John Rielly. Given the continued low oil prices next year, we have said we're going to prioritize preserving the strength of our balance sheet above all else. And so, what that means is, we're going to flex our investment down in those areas where we can. And we have a lot of flexibility offshore, we have a lot of flexibility onshore, so we're actually bringing the whole portfolio down in order to keep our balance sheet strong.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Great. And then I had a follow up, just on the thought process when it comes to exploration and the strategic importance in a commodity environment like this. But obviously, you all have had and participated in some significant discoveries. But just wanted to talk through strategically how you see exploration at this point in time? What type of flexibility you might have in the budget? And also how you think about the potential of, between seeing discoveries, such as with Exxon in Guyana and Sicily in the Gulf of Mexico, through to ultimate production? Versus the alternate possibility of attempting to perhaps monetize that resource early in the lifecycle to accelerate some cash flow and value recognition?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think that \u2013 just I'll take your last question first \u2013 I think the first order of business is understand what we have there, right? So particularly in Guyana, we've got a lot of work to do to understand the full potential of the block, so way too early to talk about monetization options or anything like that.","But how do we think about exploration right now? Well, first of all, we believe that conventional exploration is still the best way to add long-term value to grow the business with attractive returns, provided you can do it successfully, obviously. And I think importantly right now, it can be executed at a much lower cost in the current price environment. So indeed, Guyana is a case in point, where we were able to access that block at a relatively low entry cost, and are now executing this work program at historically low costs, on a cost curve. So it's a good time to be doing this kind of work. And obviously, as John and I both said in our opening remarks, we're really encouraged by the Liza discovery. It's not only a great well in itself, but it has also proven a working petroleum system on a very large block with lots of prospectivity.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Great. Thanks for the comments and again for all the disclosure.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks and good morning. Maybe if I could try a couple more \u2013 and maybe a follow-up on an earlier question. Can you talk about maybe put a few more numbers around the type of swing in cash flow that you'd see in 2017 from the start-up in North Malay in terms of how much capital rolls off versus what would the potential cash flow generation be at the current strip?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. So, I mean, this is just general guidance there. We're spending in North Malay Basin, like this year, between $500 million and $600 million. We haven't been specific, but let's just say it's carrying that type of level into 2016. And what happens in 2017, instead of spending $500 million to $600 million and having that negative cash flow, it'll actually turn cash flow positive in there. So you're at a minimum getting a $500 million to $600 million, now you're generating free cash flow. So you're potentially $700 million, $800 million swing in cash flow as it relates just to that North Malay Basin asset. And then, Stampede does continue your spending in 2016 and 2017 on the development. And then, we were spending approximately $300 million this year.","But as you move, it will be somewhere in the $300 million to $400 million as we go forward. You'll have that negative cash flow turning into positive cash flow in 2018. So on top of North Malay Basin, at that point in time, you're swinging $400-million-ish at a minimum to $500 million to $600 million to cash flow at that point in time.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe, one more in terms of portfolio construction. I mean, should we \u2013 it has been a seller's market, I think we could probably say recently out there in the market. And when you look at your portfolio right now, I mean, how do you think about the potential for \u2013 how do you think about M&A in terms of potentially monetizing non-core assets? Should Utica be considered core or non-core at this point? And maybe on the flipside in terms of acquisitions (40:00), like, what are your current thoughts?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Sure. We're always looking to upgrade or optimize our portfolio. Obviously, we never comment on M&A. But I think the important thing here is our first, second, and third priority is to keep the strong balance sheet we have strong during this period of low prices.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Hey guys. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Hey.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","John, there's I think some Bloomberg News talking about you guys maybe looking at to sell Utica. Don't know whether you can confirm it? And if you do have that possibility of thinking, what's the rationale behind?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Paul, obviously we're always looking to optimize our portfolio, but we do not comment on M&A.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And maybe for John Rielly then. Do you have 2016 \u2013 I know it's early \u2013 preliminary cost guide for cash and DD&A?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","No.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","... 2015, or at least directionally that we're going to see any meaningful drop further from the 2015 level, or that it's really going to be somewhat similar or modest?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","I mean, I understand to try to get as much guidance out, and that's why we put this preliminary guidance in this low price environment, so everybody can get a feel of what we're doing with capital, and also where we think production is going to. However, we're still fairly early in the budget process, even working with our partners. So at this point, Paul, I can't give specific cost guidance and I'll do that in January on our call, as usual.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And, John, I actually just curious or then for Greg, at today's defense or I presume it's not really economic to well any oil out from Bakken. Is that correct?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Right now, it's more economic, Paul, with the differentials to clear book having narrowed to where they're only about $1 off of WTI to prioritize moving as much oil as you can through pipeline, and we're doing that. But we still flex some of our production to rail. So where in the past maybe the mix was 50-50, like three months ago, rail versus pipeline, right now, pipeline is about 60% of what we move and rail is about 40%.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","John, can you remind me what is the minimum commitment that you have to the JV that you have to rail through?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So from our minimum \u2013 let's just call it our minimum volume commitments that we have with the Midstream. So first of all, we don't see any issue meeting our minimum volume commitments because there's a couple of things that allow us to meet that. One is additional volumes coming from our build-out of, what we call, our Hawkeye project, which is south of the river. It allows us to get volumes that we couldn't get into our infrastructure from south of the river to the infrastructure north of the river and also just up in North Dakota continued flaring and trucking reductions. And then as well we have the third-party volumes, additional third-party volumes that will come our way. So again from our minimum volume commitments from the third quarter numbers that you actually see in the press release, our minimum volume commitments for 2016 are already essentially below all those numbers that are there.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But you won't be able to tell me what's that number?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Oh, sure. I'm sorry. So if you want the actual number, so it's actually in the S-1, but crude oil loading is 38,000 and so in the third quarter you saw it was 47,000 and the crude oil transportation going through it as 43,000 versus 45,000 that we had in the third quarter.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","A final one, John and Greg, when you're looking at your Gulf of Mexico deep-water or overall your deep-water portfolio from a supply cost standpoint, are they in the middle of the pack of your overall portfolio or it's at the that high-end of your portfolio?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So from a cost standpoint on the Gulf of Mexico it is at the (44:35).","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Overall return that \u2013 the rate that you put it, I'm trying to understand that, I mean one of your largest competitors that they take a pretty radical approach and totally get out and the argument they make is that in the deep-water portfolio is at the high-end of their portfolio in supply costs, so they believe that they will be better off without even though they actually have some decent success, so just curious that in your portfolio, does it have a similar pattern or you view it differently?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Okay. No, we would view it differently. But let me just \u2013 because I don't know what the other competitor was exactly referring to, so let's just talk our Gulf of Mexico assets that are producing, they are \u2013 when you bring the Gulf of Mexico assets in general together, they are at the low cost end of our portfolio average, quite low actually. And opportunities there to drill further, kind of, exploitation opportunities and bring it into that infrastructure are some of the best returns that we have in the portfolio, so then it just becomes \u2013 I don't know if they're thinking about further development, future developments, I don't know. But again, from \u2013 as Greg said, as we look at the offshore right now and where the costs are going in the industry, we see that it's a good opportunity, like Greg had mentioned with Guyana, to be able to be investing in offshore projects right now.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everybody. Thanks for all the disclosure. Just a brief one from me, you've been very clear about your strategy in terms of cutting CapEx and maintaining a strong balance sheet. I just wondered if that leaves you any room for buybacks or any other \u2013 or whether you're going to sit at this level of financial leverage? Thanks.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Our priority here is to keep our strong balance sheet strong and that comes first before anything else. So, at the end of the day, we're cutting our CapEx and we don't think it makes sense to accelerate production in this environment and, obviously, share buybacks are taking a backseat as well.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. So we'll just sort of model forward around this level of leverage through 2016, assuming whatever oil price we are?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Obviously, it depends on your oil price.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Would you be looking to spend more in a higher oil price environment or restart buyback?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","I wouldn't want to speculate on that. We want to keep our options open.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood. Okay. Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The Bakken's been a critical source of growth and outperformance versus your own expectations. Can you just update us on down spacing in the Three Forks program as well as any new completion or drilling techniques that may or may not be having an impact here?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, you bet. First of all, the Three Forks reservoir is great. We're really drilling in the sweet spot of the sweet spot of the Three Forks right now, so it's actually outperforming the Middle Bakken marginally. So that's very good resources there in the Three Forks.","Regarding down spacing, we've got 51 wells that are on a nine and eight (48:09) spacing pilot. We plan to do 82 wells this year. 51 wells are currently online in the nine and eight (48:17) configuration, now only 20 of these wells have been online for greater than 90 days. So the initial results are encouraging and we expect to provide pilot results early next year after we get a few more wells with longer production history under our belt.","Regarding different completion techniques, we're running 50-stage pilots. So these are 50-stage sliding sleeve wells. We've got 18 wells out of the 36 wells that we planned this year online. Again, only 13 of those wells have been online for more than 30 days, so it's a little early. But initial production uplifts are in line with expectations and similar to the nine and eight (49:01). We plan to be in a position to provide the results early next year.","Now, on the 50-stage, and the nine and eight (49:09) frankly, the final decision is going to be an economic one. So does the 50-stage well generate a higher return given the higher cost? And if it does, then we would expect to move our standard to the 50-stage design from the current 35-stage design. Again, it will be an economic return question, not a higher production question.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks. As a follow up to that, how long can you keep drilling in the sweet spot of the sweet spot, as you said it, of the Three Forks before you have to move to just the sweet spot or somewhere less sweet?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Multi-years, multi-years. Not a concern right now.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And lastly, you talked to maintaining and prioritizing your balance sheet strength. Is there a \u2013 can you define that? Is it based on a certain net debt-to-EBITDA target? Are you looking to just retain flat debt levels overall? What is the flexibility you have in that balance sheet when we think about the potential for M&A without it getting too high for your own interest?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yeah. So, as we look at it right now, and again, in this low price environment, as you can imagine, the flexibility we have is that we do have $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And so that is allowing us to invest through this cycle, bring these longer-term projects on in 2017 and 2018, as well as invest in exploration such as Guyana. So what we are looking, and I'm going to say more short-term now because we are very focused on where the commodity price environment is, is maintaining that balance sheet and not increasing our debt levels. So that's where we have the ability to be able to use that balance sheet to fund that capital program. Longer-term, we'll see what happens as projects come on.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. So absolute debt, flat. Thank you.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. As you look at Hess Infrastructure Partners, you had a $425 million expansion of planned to go on service in 2017. Is that still in the plans for capital in 2016, net to your 50% interest, obviously?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So what is \u2013 and we will give more guidance in January on that \u2013 the big component of the capital for the Midstream is going to be the completion of what I referred to as the Hawkeye project. Again, it's infrastructure, it's pipelines, it's compression to be able to bring volumes south of the river in North Dakota to our infrastructure north of the river, such as our gas plant and our rail facility. So there will still be significant spend there on that project, but in January, we'll give more specifics on the levels.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah. And that project was the Hawkeye project. So that makes sense.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yes.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","The \u2013 on the other, just details of \u2013 how much does a Guyana well cost to drill, either appraisal or exploration?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Still don't know the answer to that, because we're just getting bids in now, the operator, not us, but the operator is still getting bids in. Many of the...","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","So is the Liza well was the first discovery well \u2013 what did it cost?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","I don't want to give you a number because I just can't remember off the top of my head right now.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And then just thinking through the kind of path forward, and really, I guess you're getting into that, but just fourth quarter, you talked about gas plants coming online and NGLs growing, also less downtime. Can you just give some numbers of what's the SIMOPS downtime, like amount of volumes that you had shut in maybe in the first quarter that won't be with four rigs running, or \u2013 and also, kind of what is your incremental NGLs and gas as you bring on the additional plant capacity?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Let me answer the operational question first, and then I'll turn it over to John for that. The way to think about this is this year, our availability has averaged about 87%, and that's a combination of SIMOPS and maintenance and things you have to do. What we're projecting next year is that will go up 2%.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Fewer SIMOPS. So that will give you kind of a round number that you can model.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","That's perfect.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","And again, I can't be exactly specific for you, David, as we move into \u2013 onto 2016, but so right now, our production by product in the Bakken was about 73% oil, 18% NGLs, and 9% gas. You will see, per Greg's comments, as we get up to the full capacity of the gas plant that we will be increasing on a percentage basis our NGLs and gas. Just can't be specific to you right now until we get further into the budget process.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, I just want to come back quickly on the Guyana and just remind folks on the call, remember, these wells are quite shallow. They're only 18,000 feet and they're in 5,700 feet of water. Liza well cost us about $80 million Hess net. So future wells, as you get down the learning curve, will be cheaper than that, obviously, once you get in development mode.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is now open.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, close enough. Most things have been asked. I've just got a question regarding the potential for impairments. We're seeing a lot of your peers clean house, they're wiping out goodwill, capitalized costs, whatever it may be. What's the likelihood given the reduced CapEx that some costs you're carrying ultimately opt to impair?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So I mean, in the third quarter, obviously, with the lower cost environment, we did not have any impairments in our portfolio. But, John, all I can tell you right now is, as it continues and as we finalize our budget, we will assess that and we will report it on our fourth quarter. But I can't give you any more guidance than that.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","All right, that's fine. Thanks, John.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You've given very granular guidance on Bakken decline for 2016. What other geographies are seeing the declines that are factored into your company-wide production target?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So I mean if you go across the portfolio, I mean, obviously, when you have less drilling activity, as Greg said, we're not drilling in EG (56:21), the Norway, there's a drilling break and things like that, you're just getting the natural decline of the portfolio. So as you could see, as you mentioned what the Bakken numbers are, we can't be specific at this point until we finalize our budget. But you can kind of say that the reduction is kind of half due to less drilling activities and half due to natural decline to our portfolio.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Understood. And I guess on a percentage basis, if Bakken is seeing the steepest decline across your portfolio in 2016, maybe what's the second biggest contributor to the overall decline? I mean would it be North Sea? Or would it be some of your more mature stuff?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","What it is, and it really has to do with the way the net entitlement works. As Greg had mentioned, in JDA, we're finishing up the booster compression project there. So, one, you probably noticed in our numbers, we've had some net entitlement changes this year that's dropped in the third quarter for JDA. So, on an overall basis, the next biggest component beyond Bakken would be JDA because well there's less cost recovery barrels that we'll have in 2016 as well as with the booster compression, there'll be some downtime at JDS.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, very helpful. Appreciate it, guys.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","You bet. And I want to give all of the callers one more clarifying comment. The $80 million Liza cost was a gross cost not a net cost. I wanted to clear that up on the call.","Operator","And we do have a follow up question from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. John, I know that you don't have a detailed budget, but curious since you know you're going to do a forward program in Bakken, do you have a number what's the CapEx on Bakken for next year?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","No, no, we don't have that yet. Again, we'll get that in January. Again, so we're just fine-tuning how much is near field infrastructure, things like that. So we'll provide that number in January.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you very much.

Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will provide an update on the progress we continue to make in managing in the low oil price environment while preserving our long-term growth options. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance from the quarter, and John Rielly will review our financial results.","Our company is well-positioned for the current price environment and for the eventual recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheet and liquidity positions among our peers, a resilient portfolio, and an exceptional long-term growth outlook.","In terms of our balance sheet, we started 2016 by reducing our E&P capital and exploratory budget to $2.4 billion, 40% below our 2015 spend and cut activity across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Since then we have continued to pursue further capital reductions.","In the second quarter of 2016, we reduced E&P capital and exploratory expenditures by 52% from the second quarter of last year to $485 million. We now project our full-year 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures to be $2.1 billion, about 48% below 2015 levels and $300 million lower than our previous forecast. Efforts are under way to make further reductions as well.","We have the balance sheet and liquidity necessary to invest in our future growth. Our three growth projects will make us a much stronger company in the next few years in terms of visible production and cash flow growth as well as improving returns.","As you know, we are investing about $700 million in 2016 in two offshore developments, North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These two projects, which will come online in 2017 and 2018 respectively, will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and go from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company.","In terms of our third major growth project, offshore Guyana, on June 30, Hess and co-venture partner and operator ExxonMobil announced positive results from the Liza-2 well in the Stabroek block. The results confirmed a world-class oil discovery, one of the largest in the last 10 years, with estimated recoverable resource for the Liza discovery of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We believe the Stabroek block has the potential to materially contribute to our resource base and future production growth and create significant value for our shareholders.","On July 17, the operators spud the Skipjack well, which is a separate but similar prospect located approximately 25 miles to the northwest of the Liza-1 well. We expect to have the results from this well by our next conference call. Following the Skipjack well, the operator intends to drill a third well at Liza to further appraise the discovery.","In addition, predevelopment activities are under way, and we look forward to working with our partners and the government of Guyana to move this exciting discovery towards a commercialization decision. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics and expect the call on capital next year to be manageable, given our strong cash position. As plans progress, we will continue to keep you informed.","Turning to our financial results, in the second quarter of 2016 we posted a net loss of $392 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $335 million or $1.10 per common share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $147 million or $0.52 per common share in the second quarter of last year.","Compared to the second quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and sales volumes, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash costs and DD&A. Net production averaged 313,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to net production of 386,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter, pro forma for last year's sale of our Algeria asset.","While we continue to have strong performance from the Bakken, overall company production during the quarter was primarily affected by unplanned downtime due to subsurface safety valve failures in related remediation work at the Tubular Bells field and a mechanical issue at one well in the Conger field both in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, planned shutdowns at several offshore fields, including Tubular Bells and Valhall field in Norway, and reduced capital investment as compared with last year.","Due to the unplanned downtime at the Tubular Bells and Conger fields, which Greg will address in more detail, we are revising our overall company production forecast for 2016 to a range of 315,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, from our previous guidance of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Turning to the Bakken, net production in the second quarter of 2016 averaged 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2015, reflecting our reduced drilling program. Through the use of lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team continues to drill some of the lowest-cost and most productive wells in the play.","Notably, during the second quarter, we reduced drilling and completion costs 14% from the year-ago quarter to an average of $4.8 million per well, even as we shifted from 35-stage to 50-stage wells, which is delivering a 15% to 20% uplift in initial production rates.","For full-year 2016, we are narrowing our Bakken production forecast to a range of 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing the upper end of our previous guidance of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production or drilling up our best locations in the current low price environment is in the best interest of our shareholders. While our Bakken acreage can generate attractive returns at current low prices, we will remain disciplined and begin to increase activity there when oil prices approach $60 per barrel. As we see that a price recovery is sustained, we will also then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore, where we have numerous high return investment opportunities.","In summary, we have one of the strongest balance sheets and most attractive long-term growth profiles among our peers. We remain confident in our ability to manage through the current environment and deliver strong production and cash flow growth as oil prices recover.","Our resilient portfolio provides an attractive mix of short-cycle and long-cycle growth options, including an unparalleled position in the Bakken, two significant offshore developments that will become cash generators starting in 2017 and 2018, and the recent world-class oil discovery in Guyana that has the potential to create material value for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. As John said, we are focused on maximizing value, not volume, and have reduced our drilling program to levels that allow us to manage near-term cash flow, while maintaining our operating capabilities in the current low price environment.","When oil prices approach $60 per barrel, we will begin to ramp up activity, starting with the Bakken. As the price recovery is sustained, we will then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore. However, given that oil prices have remained below $50 per barrel, we have further reduced our 2016 E&P capital and exploratory budget to $2.1 billion from our previous guidance of $2.4 billion, which represents a 48% reduction from 2015. This decrease reflects our continuing focus on reducing costs across our portfolio.","Now moving to production, in the second quarter, we averaged 313,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of 320,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter.","As discussed on our last call, we had a series of extended planned shutdowns at the Valhall field in Norway and at the Tubular Bells and Conger fields in the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter. In addition, we experienced a mechanical issue that affected one well at the Conger field and had further downtime at the Tubular Bells field to replace a second defective subsurface safety valve.","In July, we have experienced a third subsurface safety valve failure. We are actively pursuing legal claims against the vendor who provided the defective valve at Tubular Bells. The third valve failure at Tubular Bells and the mechanical issue with the Conger well will be remediated in the fourth quarter.","These issues, along with decreased investment levels, led us to reduce our full-year 2016 production guidance to 315,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. We forecast companywide production in the third quarter to average between 310,000 and 315,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.","Our third quarter forecast reflects planned downtime at the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, the South Arne field in Denmark, and the mechanical issues at Tubular Bells and Conger, as well as hurricane contingency in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced investment levels.","While preserving the strength of our balance sheet in the current environment is crucial, it is equally important for us to be well-positioned for a price recovery by maintaining both our operating capabilities and the opportunities to drive future profitable growth. It is therefore significant to Hess that at the end of June ExxonMobil announced the drilling results from the Liza-2 well, the second well in the Stabroek block, offshore Guyana, in which Hess holds a 30% interest.","The Liza-2 well encountered more than 190 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs in upper Cretaceous formations. After successfully concluding an extensive well evaluation program and extended production test, ExxonMobil confirmed Liza as a world-class discovery with a recoverable resource of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent.","The Stabroek block extends to 6.6 million acres, and on July 17, we spud an exploration well on a second prospect, Skipjack, located approximately 25 miles northwest of Liza. We remain excited not only about the Liza discovery but the wider opportunity set on this block, which has the potential to be transformational to our company.","Turning now to unconventionals, net production from the Bakken averaged 106,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, in line with the guidance of 100,000 to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day given on our first quarter call. We maintained an average of three Bakken rigs in the second quarter. We plan to drop to two rigs in August and will begin to increase activity when oil prices approach $60 per barrel.","Over 2016, we now expect to drill 65 wells and bring 90 new wells online. In the first half of 2016, we drilled 39 new wells and brought 57 new wells online, and we plan to drill 26 new wells and bring 33 online in the second half of the year as the lower rig count takes effect.","In the second quarter, our average drilling and completion cost was $4.8 million per well. I'm very proud of our Bakken team, who has driven down D&C costs by 14% versus the year-ago quarter, even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new 50-stage completion design. With the higher stage count, we expect to see 30-day IP rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second half of 2016 and expect that these wells in the core of the play will show a 7% uplift in EUR per well.","As a result of the increased productivity and EUR, and lower drilling and completion costs, we have significantly increased the number of well locations that are economic at lower prices. Because of our continued strong performance, we are narrowing our full-year 2016 net production guidance for the Bakken to 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the upper end of the 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day range that we provided in January.","Moving to the Utica, the joint venture has drilled no new wells since we released the rig we had operating in the play in early March. Net production for the second quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter.","Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica activity is focused in the core of the play. Because the acreage in the core is held by production, we can reduce activity in the short term and preserve optionality and longer term upside. We plan to run the asset for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices.","As a result of applying our distinctive lean manufacturing approach, over the past few years we've been able to reduce our Utica drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion costs per stage by approximately 50%. Using competitor benchmarking, we know that we are achieving some of the lowest D&C costs and drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. These advances position us well to restart activity when prices improve.","Now turning to the offshore and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. At the Conger field, a mechanical failure on one well resulted in the loss of 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production during the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this well will be worked over in the fourth quarter.","At our Tubular Bells field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, due to the remediation work on the second well with a defective valve and a 35-day shutdown to allow for the tieback of Noble's Gunflint to the Williams-owned facility.","As mentioned previously, in July we experienced another valve failure on a third well. This well will remain shut in until completion of remediation work in the fourth quarter. As a result of the cumulative downtime in 2016 from the three valve failures, we have reduced our full-year 2016 net production guidance for Tubular Bells to 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. A fifth production well at Tubular Bells was spud mid-June, which is scheduled to be brought online in early 2017, and we anticipate starting water injection in the third quarter.","In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. The planned annual turnaround was completed on schedule in early July.","In June, BP and Aker announced the creation of a new operating entity, Aker BP ASA. We look forward to working with the new partner to deliver further operational efficiencies and value from future development.","At the South Arne field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, net production averaged 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter. Looking forward, a 20-day planned maintenance shutdown is scheduled in the third quarter.","At the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has as a 50% interest, net production averaged 236 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter. There is a scheduled 15-day shutdown in the third quarter to commission the new booster compressor.","Moving to developments, at North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, second quarter net production averaged 33 million cubic feet per day through the early production system and is expected to remain at about this level through 2016.","In the second quarter, we installed three wellhead platforms and a jacket for the central processing platform. We also successfully drilled the first eight of 11 wells for Phase I of the full field development project, which is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day following startup in 2017.","At the Stampede development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, the hull left the manufacturing yard in South Korea on schedule. Fabrication and precommissioning of the topsides continue according to plan, and drilling operations continue to progress. First oil remains on schedule for 2018.","In closing, while the second quarter has been challenging as a result of continued low oil prices and short-term production issues, we remain confident in our resilient portfolio and strong long-term growth outlook, which includes our offshore development projects at North Malay Basin and Stampede, our premier positions in the Bakken and Utica, our high margin chalk reservoir positions at Valhall and South Arne, and our position in Guyana, which represents a world-class opportunity.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2016. The corporation incurred a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared with a net loss of $509 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $335 million in the second quarter of 2016.","Turning to exploration and production, on an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the second quarter and the first quarter of 2016 were as follows.","Higher realized selling prices improved results by $155 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $31 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $36 million. Lower production expenses improved results by $9 million. Lower exploration expenses improved results by $8 million. All other items improved results by $3 million for an overall decrease in the second quarter net loss of $180 million.","In the second quarter, our E&P operations were over lifted compared with production by approximately 1.7 million barrels, which had the effect of decreasing our second quarter net loss by approximately $5 million. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 47% in the second quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 41% in the first quarter.","Turning to Bakken Midstream, second quarter net income of $11 million decreased from $14 million in the first quarter, primarily due to higher DD&A and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream, excluding the non-controlling interest, amounted to $68 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $70 million in the first quarter.","Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $75 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $72 million in the first quarter. The increase resulted from higher professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses.","Turning to cash flow for the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $257 million. The net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $60 million. Additions to property, plant, and equipment were $615 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $80 million. Net debt repayments were $43 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $89 million. All other items resulted in an increase in cash of $8 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $462 million.","Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion, total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities of $7.7 billion, and total debt of $5.9 billion at June 30, 2016. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio excluding the Bakken Midstream was 23.5%.","Now to provide additional third-quarter and full-year 2016 guidance, first for exploration and production. We project cash costs for E&P operations to be in the range of $16 to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $16 to $17 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous guidance of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel. The increase in full-year guidance is due to workovers required at Tubular Bells and Conger and the impact of fixed costs spread over lower production volumes.","DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $28 to $29 per barrel in the third quarter and $27 to $28 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel. The decrease in full-year guidance is due to the change in the mix of production. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $44 to $46 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 and $43 to $45 per barrel for the full year.","The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.10 to $4.20 per barrel for the third quarter of 2016 and $3.80 to $4 per barrel for the full year of 2016 versus prior guidance of $3.55 to $3.95 per barrel, reflecting lower total production volumes.","Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the third quarter and $260 million to $280 million for the full year, consistent with previous guidance. The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the third quarter and 41% to 45% for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance.","For Bakken Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the third quarter and $40 million to $50 million for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance.","Turning to corporate, we expect corporate expenses net of taxes to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the third quarter of 2016 and $100 million to $110 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $110 million to $120 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the third quarter of 2016, and $195 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $205 million to $215 million.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning everybody. Greg, I wonder if I could touch on the issues in the Gulf of Mexico? Obviously, when you gave guidance at the end of the first quarter, some of these issues were already known, so I'm just trying to understand how much of the incremental problems occurred post the first quarter. And if possible, can you speak to the production capacity in the Gulf going into next year? Is that impacted in any way or is the capacity basically \u2013 what would you expect the (30:44) capacity to recover to, I guess is what I'm trying to find out?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Okay. Thanks, Doug. Yeah. As we kind of said in our opening remarks now, we've had three subsurface safety valve failures in Tubular Bells. The second valve affected us in the second quarter and the third valve is going to affect us in the third quarter. And in addition to that, we had a mechanical failure at Conger that was unanticipated as well.","So the net effect of that, if we look at kind of guidance for those assets, is about 15,000 barrels a day difference lowering of our guidance, and about 10,000 of that is at Tubular Bells and about 5,000 of that is at Conger. So, if we look at capacity going into the end of the year, we should be back up to that 70,000 to 75,000 barrels a day range in the Gulf of Mexico. So if you look \u2013 so again, going back to the guidance, it was actually about 15,000 on T-Bells and 5,000 on Conger. I said 10 and 5. It's actually 15,000 and 5,000. So that gives you a sense for how big the magnitude was of those two issues in the Gulf.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So the capacity really isn't \u2013 all things beyond the mechanical issues, the capacity shouldn't be impacted, got it.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","No.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Greg, just a quick follow-on to that, can you speak to the nature of any \u2013 what you would expect by way of compensation there? I mean is this a \u2013 do you have insurance losses or how does it work exactly?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Well, we're going \u2013 we've got our legal claims as we speak, and we're going to be going for the cost of the replacement valve. We're going to go for the cost of the remediation work and also lost profits due to downtime and finally attorney's fees. So we are going after it all.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. My follow-up, if I may, as you can imagine, is in Guyana. Realizing you're not the operator, to the extent you can, can you outline what your expectations are for Skipjack as it relates to the risk profile post-Liza? Is Skipjack a ranked wildcat? Has it been de-risked in some way? And any color you can offer in terms of your expectations now that you're there? Thanks.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, thanks, Doug. I mean clearly, we are extremely excited about the results at Liza again confirming a recoverable resource of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels. The well test at Liza was high quality, very good, confirmed the presence of high quality oil that we saw in Liza-1. We saw about 190 feet of oil-bearing sandstone in the Upper Cretaceous. And remember that the Liza-2 well was only 2 miles from the Liza-1 well.","So all that taken in context means that the POSG of Skipjack has gone up substantially. So we're excited about it, and certainly the seismic signature looks very similar to the one on Liza, so but until we get a well in the ground we can't be 100% positive as to the outcome, but very encouraging, very excited.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Timing Greg, early September?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, we should have the result. I think we said in our remarks we should have the results of the well by our next quarterly conference call.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You mentioned in your comments that the call on capital for Guyana for 2017 is expected to be manageable. Can you talk more on how you expect to finance that, whether it would just be reflected in offsetting decreases in CapEx as other projects come online? Whether it would be debt to near liquidity, asset sales, or whether you would consider additional equity and if you have any sense of what you think that capital commitment might be next year?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Brian. And I mean, as John mentioned, we do see this as being manageable at this point. Our current judgment is that the future spend will fit nicely in our portfolio as our major project spending and obligations on North Malay Basin and Stampede will be falling off over the next couple of years. And so by 2018 North Malay Basin and Stampede will have flipped from material cash users, as John said earlier, approximately $700 million this year, to cash generators. So just with the normal phasing with any development we see, this fits nicely in 2017 and then with more of the spending happening 2018 and beyond.","And as we look at our portfolio at the capital for Guyana, and like you said, there are other capital that will be falling off in 2017, such as like in the Gulf of Mexico and some of the capital we had spent in Denmark this year. So it does fit nicely into 2017 and we project from our strong cash position that we can fund our capital, including our growth projects, through 2017, even in this low price environment with the current cash on hand.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you. And then on the revisions to your guidance, can you talk about the impact in more \u2013 and be more specific \u2013 in some greater specificity on the deferred activity? How much of that was responsible for the decrease in the capital budget versus cost savings? And where is that all \u2013 where is that all coming from? The same question as it relates to the production drop, although I may have pieced together it's 5,000 BOE a day based on earlier comments.","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So from just the $300 million that we've reduced our 2016 capital program, the majority of that reduction is due to cost reductions. Obviously, in this low price environment, we're day-in and day-out looking at cost reductions on the capital side and the operating side as well. So it really is across the whole portfolio. It's not like there's a big chunk in any individual area, so it's in exploration, it's in production, and it's in development. We have some deferred activity that we're just looking at from the price environment slipping out to 2017 as prices improve, but the majority is cost reductions.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And was there an impact on the production guidance from that as well or was it all coming from the Gulf of Mexico issues?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's minor on the production from the capital reductions. Obviously, we could put capital to work because we have great locations here in the Bakken to put capital to work at these prices, but it's not what we're going to do. We're emphasizing value over volumes, and we won't ramp up until prices really get close to $60, because we think that's a better economic decision.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And that's despite the number \u2013 despite the increase in stages in the Bakken, despite the enhanced stage count there?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Correct. We just don't think it makes sense to accelerate that production right now, because you know, in the wells, in the first year of the well, it declines 70% in these unconventional reservoirs. So, again, we'd like to see higher prices before we bring on this good core of the core Bakken acreage.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","I think those 50 stages really bode well though for the resumption of activity because, again, IP rates have gone up 15% to 20% and EURs are up 7%. So that will bode extremely well for ramp-up in activity.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Two unrelated questions, the Upstream magazine I think has reported that Skipjack has an even larger aerial extent than Liza. Maybe if you can sort of comment a little bit about Skipjack relative to Liza on a predrilled basis?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Ed, you'll have to talk to the operator about that. I will tell you that, on seismic, it looks very similar.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then on the Bakken, Schlumberger were talking last week about how much the industry is going to have to give back as a share of their cash flow to the service companies, as well as obviously put rigs back to work to get U.S. production to grow. Obviously that's a bit of a pitch from them. But how much risk do you think there is over time to your $4.8 million well costs in the Bakken as you go forward? Have you done any sensitivities to inflation levels?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I think Ed \u2013 I think, as we've said before, obviously there could be some minor friction costs associated with a startup, but we've done a lot to try and preserve our lean manufacturing capability, particularly on the rig crews, by doubling up and tripling up so that we can really manage a smooth transition in a ramp-up. And then our belief is that, with our lean manufacturing gains continuing, that any friction costs we'll be able to cover just as we have in the past with using our lean manufacturing techniques.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then on the pressure pumping side with the attrition you're seeing in the fleet over time, say, not an issue for next year or the year after, but as you get into maybe 2018, I mean, how much would that add do you think, if you went back to normal margins?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I think it's just too early to tell. I think there's going to be a lot of factors that drive those numbers, how much equipment is no longer available for service, how rapid is the ramp-up in the industry? There's a lot of moving pieces there that will determine how much that will ultimately be. But again, I think with lean manufacturing our aim and our goal is to cover as much of that as possible by using those techniques.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And finally \u2013 this may go back to the operator again, but what's the constraint on perhaps adding a rig in Guyana, because obviously exploration takes time, and rightfully so. But from an equity perspective, there's a lot of shale activity going on at the same time in other basins, so speed is something that investors sometimes want. So maybe just talk through the constraints. Is it geological or cash flow or other things in terms of adding a rig?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, I think we're in active conversations with the operator on the rig levels, both for next year for appraisal and development and all those things that we want to do and additional exploration. We're actively in conversations with the operator about that as we speak. And while next year's program still needs to be finalized, the focus definitely will be on exploration activities on the block as well as the predevelopment work, working with the partners and the government to move forward expeditiously on a commercialization decision on Liza.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks, guys. Actually E got my question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Asit Sen of CLSA. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So two questions, first on cost deflation and second a quick one on Bakken. On cost deflation, Greg or John, given your involvement in both short-cycle shale and the new upcoming long-cycle deepwater projects, I just wanted to get your sense of what you are seeing in terms of cost deflation or your visibility, given recent comments by the oil service majors. So that's number one. And what percent of your CapEx \u2013 I would imagine most of it over the next 12 months to 18 months is committed? And second on Bakken, Greg, could you remind us, how many rigs do you need to keep production flat?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. So to hold production flat at broadly 100,000 barrels a day, we've said that we need four rigs to do that. Now, with the 15% to 20% uplift, the 50-stage fracks, it's probably somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000, as a result of that uplift.","Regarding the cost reductions, I think obviously in the onshore, I think that's largely flattened out, so I think further cost reductions there will be minimal. The ones that we are accomplishing are due to lean manufacturing, which is continuing to chop out waste and inefficiency and all those things. And I want to really comment on that because if you think about our performance of delivering a $4.8 million well, a substantial reduction from the prior year and the prior quarter, that was while also increasing the stage count from 35 to 50.","So that's a major performance improvement, and all of that was lean manufacturing. So I think that we'll continue in our operation to drive those costs down, because we know that there's even more efficiencies in spud-to-spud. And so we're going after those in earnest.","In the offshore, I think there have definitely been some major price reductions, so rigs, boats, and all the associated equipment is down substantially. We're already seeing some of those benefits in Guyana, for example, on the rig rates and seismic boat rates and all that.","And then the last kind of penny to drop I think is really the yards in Southeast Asia. So if you look at their capacity loading, it's going to drop substantially over the next 12 months. And I think that will open up another cost reduction opportunity. So for us, Guyana is coming almost at just the right time because you'll have low costs not only in drilling, but also in development if we sanction a project there for the development project as well.","Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC","Very helpful. Thanks Greg.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. good morning.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Good morning.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, just curious that, have you guys got the process talking to your vendor and trying to extend the contract period and lock in some of the very cheap service cost today, or do you think you have time to wait?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","No. I think, Paul, we're beginning those conversations. As John mentioned, as prices approach $60, we all wonder when that will be, but as prices approach $60, we want to be ready for that ramp-up. So we're starting the conversations now with certainly our vendors in the onshore.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Are you going to, say, wait until that you see $55 plus before you sign those contracts or do you think you're going to sign those contracts relatively soon?","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we make those decisions Paul, we'll keep you informed.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. On the Tubular Bells, can you tell us that who is the vendor? And also that have you already gone through a detailed inventory track on everything that they have provided you to see if there's additional issues?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yes, we have, and the vendor is Schlumberger. Obviously it's extremely disappointing. It relates to some quality control and some of the components in the valves. And as I mentioned from the previous question, we are going to go after the cost of the replacement belts, the cost of the remediation work, lost profits due to downtime and all the attorney's fees. It's very disappointing.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And is Schlumberger also providing those safety valves for Stampede?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yes, but they've been upgraded. We've gone through those valves and they've been upgraded and the quality control problems have been fixed as far as we can tell.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And the next one is for John Rielly. John, the second quarter your cash flow from operations annual run rate is about $1 billion, and that's about $46 oil price. Is that a reasonable normal run rate given the pricing environment, or this is some positive or negative one-off adjustment that we need to make related to that run rate?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So for the run rate at that price from cash flow from operations only, the only adjustments that you would make, and that is we've had the additional remediation costs at Tubular Bells, so for that production, obviously affected by the shutdowns in the quarter, and then the additional cost for Tubular Bells remediation in the quarter, so you're in that $30 million to $40 million type range on that adjustment.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And either for Greg or John, talking about Liza, I know it's early stage, any kind of rough preliminary estimate what oil prices you need in order to generate a 15% internal rate of return for that project? And how is that comparing to the Conger discovery that you made?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","So it's early and I think this is the type of information that the operator will be giving out. So what are the benefits of Liza, let's just say, because we always want to make sure we talk about the difference of Guyana, and Liza in general, versus let's say offshore Gulf of Mexico Paleogene.","So in offshore Guyana these wells are only 13,000 feet below the mud line, so 18,000 total depth. So the depth is much \u2013 is shorter than obviously the Gulf of Mexico so drilling wells will be cheaper. The reservoir is quite good, so we should get good flow rates out of Guyana for that. There is no salt cover, which one helps with imaging, as we were talking about the Skipjack prospect, but again takes casing strings out while we're drilling wells. So, again, that makes it better.","And then the other thing from a \u2013 I can't talk about the particulars, but it is a PSC. So you get benefit obviously at lower prices with higher cost recovery. So putting all those together makes Guyana \u2013 I'm going to say completely different than the Gulf of Mexico and therefore in lower price environments Guyana competes.","So I think beyond that you'll have to talk to the operator, and as we get to FID and Exxon puts out that costs and numbers like that, as when FID happens, you can get a better feel for those economics.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Can you give us a rough idea that what's the timeline when you decide whether you go for the early production system, or that \u2013 I mean, is there any timeline we should be watching?","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Obviously, Paul, as we mentioned before, predevelopment work is under way, so obviously it's underway because we and our partners and the government are encouraged that we have the type of information that we could move forward on a commercialization decision on Liza. And when we do, we will keep you informed.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. A final one, Greg, you haven't mentioned anything about Ghana and in terms of the discovery and that negotiation with the government. Any update there?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sorry, my mic was off. As we've said before, we're really unable to proceed with the development of this license until there's a resolution of the border dispute. So we're continuing feed. We're continuing all the project work, and we're also in discussions with the government to modify the license deadlines with respect to the border dispute. And then once that situation is resolved, we'll be in the position to make an informed decision on where we go next.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And in Liza, that broad \u2013 when the exploration period will expire?","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's mid-2018 for the exploration period.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","2018? Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Maybe a question on asset sales at this point. I mean, do you see a role for asset sales in helping to manage capital requirements over the next couple of years? Anything in the portfolio that you would see as potentially non-core at this point? And maybe part of that are you happy with your existing working interest at Guyana, or would you consider farming that down at some point?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Our first priority is to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and to fund the growth opportunities that we talked about. In that respect, we are really well-positioned with $3.1 billion of cash at the end of the second quarter. In the normal course of business, we're always looking to optimize our portfolio, be it selling assets, buying assets, but any of those opportunities would need to compete for capital against our existing attractive growth options, including the Bakken, Utica, North Malay Basin, Stampede, and obviously Guyana. So from an M&A perspective, buying or selling, it's lower on the priority list because of the cash position we have and the growth we've already captured.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then maybe slightly related to that, your decision to \u2013 your decision on Sicily, I mean, is that just a reflection of allocation of scarce capital? Is it in line with your previous comments that you were talking about Guyana versus Gulf of Mexico development, or is there something about the asset that wasn't particularly attractive? And did you \u2013 was there an effort made to sell the position or are you just withdrawing from the position?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","So first of all, I think it was \u2013 it's a combination of factors, so it's the current price environment, the limited time remaining on the leases, and as you have intimated, we've got some great growth prospects in our portfolio. So as we kind of looked at Sicily in the context of our existing portfolio, we said, you know, it's going to struggle to compete for capital against all the great opportunities we have. So that's when we made the decision, even though we found hydrocarbons there and there's a lot of oil in place there, we made the decision to say, no, it's not going to compete in our portfolio, so we are not going to elect to do any more work on the block.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And did you try to sell that position or was it just an exit?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, it'll just be an exit. Yeah.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, guys. Thank you. You've covered a lot of ground here. One thing that intrigues me about Hess is the way your tax rate will essentially benefit you if prices rise. Can you talk a little bit about that? I think it's an important part of the bull case for Hess. Thank you.","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You are absolutely right, Paul. So in the U.S. and in Norway, we've said we will not be paying cash taxes for the next five years because of the investments we've made in both of those countries. And quite frankly, with the way prices have been here recently, it's going to extend beyond five years.","So we will benefit from that from a cash flow standpoint ,and we'll get that uplift. And it's part of the thing that we talk about, that like $1 right now is approximately $70 million of cash flow for us, or $10 obviously being $700 million. If you were looking at that from a results standpoint that would only be in the $45, $50 type range, the difference being the tax benefit and essentially that cash benefit that we have.","So we will get that uplift when prices improve and we go back to drilling. And so from additional volumes and the cash flow that comes in, we'll get, if you want to say, increase because of the cash tax position that we're in.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood. And I know you've totally changed the subject to one you've talked a lot about already, but the Guyana situation is I think the press release especially coming from ExxonMobil is one of the most \u2013 biggest I've ever seen in terms of the use of the word world-class and the range of the prospect.","Can you just talk a bit more about really how you see yourselves in terms of whether this is to let's say to throw up yet another potential development of a similar scale to Liza or another? Would you be looking to reduce your position or do you really want to run this one through and stay with the fact that you've got a world-class operator in such a material stake? I'm just struggling sort of to get my arms around the scale and how the scale relates to Hess and whether you can help us with \u2013 whether if it was within its current range, you would want to stay fully invested at the current level or if there's some sort of trigger point, just to help us out. Thank you.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We're very comfortable staying at the current level, Paul. Obviously, this will take time to unfold as evaluation work and predevelopment work is done. We think the block has extraordinary potential, and that will be very good for our shareholders. And the work that we're doing we see it phased over time, so we see our ability to fund it to be manageable.","We talked about next year and then John talked about the years after that. So with the visibility that we see so far, we should be fine from a funding perspective, as well as the fact that this is probably one of the best uses of our capital, so we will want to stay in.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. I understand that. Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. You touched on this briefly, but can you add any color regarding Aker BP operating Valhall once the merger is complete? I mean, is there some anticipation that this might prove superior to BP's operatorship in some way?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, I think it's \u2013 I think it's early to say actually. John and I met with the senior leadership of Aker BP and I will say that we left very encouraged. They have a culture similar to ours, meaning an independent, and they like to get after stuff and they're innovative. And in particular, they're practitioners of lean.","And as you know, supplying lean on Valhall through BP has led to a substantial reduction in abandonment costs, well abandonment costs, by up to 50% as a result of applying lean, and then drilling costs for new wells on the order of 30% with much more to come. So we're excited about having another partner in this venture that also is a lean practitioner. We think there will be a lot of power in that in really driving down the cost and delivering value from Valhall.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. As you move towards commercialization of Liza, do you anticipate any special issues, bearing in mind that oil infrastructure development at Guyana is essentially going to be starting from scratch?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","No. None that you wouldn't have anywhere else. I mean, the oil will most likely be tankered so I don't foresee any issues there. And certainly things will be built probably in other parts of the world to get started. And so I don't think there's any particular concerns about Guyana.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And my last question is you've touched on it broadly. Your JV partner identified two completions and five timelines in Utica in the second quarter. And since your remarks even today suggest that the Bakken should generally attract capital before the Utica, can you add a little color as to how Utica attracted activity in the quarter?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yes. I think we had some wells that we completed in the quarter, so we brought \u2013 we completed two, and we bought five wells online in the second quarter. And that essentially completes the activity that we plan to do in the Utica this year. I always like to remind people, our Utica position is unique because it is in the core of the core, it is held by production, and it only has 5% royalty.","So because of that, that really delivers superior economics even at low prices relative to the people around us. So just like the Bakken, as prices approach $60 and we see some margin improvement unique to the liquids in kind of the environment in the Utica, we would expect to get back to work in the Utica as well as the Bakken as we approach those numbers.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Guy Baber of Simmons. Your line is now open.","Guy A. Baber IV - Simmons & Company","Thanks for taking my question. Just as a follow-up to the last question, you mentioned the resumption of drilling at the Utica and offshore at a sustained higher price. Can you talk a little bit more about what price you need to see? I think you mentioned $60 sustainably before, but how you would look to deploy capital and where you would go first and what the order looks like? But it sounds as if Utica would be ahead of Gulf of Mexico infill drilling or other offshore infill drilling opportunities. Is that a fair comment?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, I think it \u2013 we'll evaluate it as the situation unfolds. I think the point is we've got an awful lot of profitable development opportunities in our portfolio, and how those shake out as prices improve, we'll answer that at that moment in time. It's going to be a function of rig rates and supply costs and all those things that go into economic decisions.","But I think the point is that outside of the Bakken, we have exceptional opportunities to grow this business, not only in the Utica but also in our offshore assets, be it the Gulf of Mexico or the chalk assets in the North Sea. So as John said in his opening remarks, I do think we have an exceptional growth portfolio that can deliver outstanding growth as a function of price.","Guy A. Baber IV - Simmons & Company","Okay, great. And then I had two follow-ups on capital spending. You mentioned there were efforts underway to make further reductions to the $2.1 billion budget. Is there anything specific that you would call out, or is it just the continued application of lean manufacturing?","And then secondly, as we think about the capital spending profile over the next couple of years, is it a fair characterization that you all are comfortable with CapEx above and beyond your cash inflows to a certain extent, just given the strength of the balance sheet and the strength of your growth projects?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So from the further capital reductions it is just continuing lean across our whole portfolio and organization just to drive out costs. So it's an ongoing kind of culture that we have to continue to drive down the cost. So that's really what that would be from a cost standpoint.","As far as capital goes, it's early right now, so what we are talking about here is what we've been doing in 2016. And it's still early for us. And we'll give further updates here as we get into early 2017, especially on Guyana, because that will be a part of the growth capital that now gets added in.","So what we'll be doing, we will be spending in Guyana, for all those reasons that we've talked about today on the returns that we believe we see in Guyana, so we'll be spending there. We'll be finishing North Malay Basin, and we'll be finishing Stampede to bring on that 35,000 barrels a day in 2018.","So along with that, depending on where we see price moving to, if we don't see it moving more to $55, $60, you'll see more of the same of what we're doing in our portfolio right now. As prices move up, then we're going to start going back to those opportunities that Greg just talked about that we see across the portfolio.","Guy A. Baber IV - Simmons & Company","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Your line is now open.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. Most things have been asked, so I'll be brief. With the Bakken, with these 50-stage frack wells, how much sand and floats (65:29) are you putting down, Greg?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sorry, my mic was off again. Per-stage proppant loadings, it ranges to where you are in the field. We really do it DSU by DSU, but on the order of 80,000 to 100,000 depending on where you are in the field. So that's kind of the proppant loading per stage.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And not to beat Liza into the ground, for your predevelopment activities, could you better characterize what they are, because I don't think people fully understand it?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","In Guyana you mean? Well, I think it's just the usual...","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yes right. Exactly. Are you arranging marine transportation? Are you looking at yards? What's the predevelopment activity right now?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, I think it's the usual pre-project, concept select, trying to figure out which concept you're going to have, potentially how many wells you're going to drill, how many producers, how many injectors, et cetera, et cetera. So that's all the predevelopment work that's going on.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Two questions, the first one back to the approaching $60 number you mentioned. About a month ago, the 12-month strip for WTI was actually in the mid-50s. When you saw that, did you think maybe not take the extra rig off, going from three to two in August as you're currently planning? Was that ever under consideration?","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, we always look at different options to maximize value for our shareholders. But having said that, no, our commitment was to go down to two rigs to preserve cash, but also we think it's about value not volumes. And we really, at the end of the day, while you always think about making midcourse adjustments to maximize value, the decision was and it still is to go to two rigs.","And then as prices start to improve, as the market rebalances, and I think the market is in the process of rebalancing because non-OPEC production is down, offset by OPEC production, but you're still growing demand in the world over 1 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, somewhere in that range, inventory draws are going to happen, probably accelerate in the fourth quarter. And with that we see that positive to prices starting to recover and going up. So as we get closer to $60, that's when we'll start putting plans in place to start to go up in our rig count in the Bakken. And we're sticking to that.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then second question about the Bakken MLP. So this year \u2013 or this month marks the one-year anniversary of your deal with Global Infrastructure Partners. Is it safe to say that you're going to want to stabilize your Bakken volumes before you move forward with the IPO? Is that part of the prerequisite to getting that done?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So the way that we are looking at it right now, we are committed to doing the IPO. And so it is part of our plans to do that, us and our partner GIP, but it is when market conditions warrant. And so one is the MLP market itself, which has improved, but we will continue to watch that.","And then it's exactly as you just said, Pavel. As from the oil price standpoint, to get the prices up, for us to put more rigs back to work and in this great position that we have in the Bakken, that's when we start to see that. And that growth combined with any improvements in the MLP market is when we would be looking at timing of that.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate, it guys.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram, of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Arun Jayaram from JPM. Just a quick question on Tubular Bells. You guided to 10 for the year. Could you give us a sense of what you expect the exit rate to be at Tubular Bells once the remediation activities are completed, plus what the fifth well will do in terms of deliverability as we think about 2017?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. So we'll give guidance here as we get into early 2017 on Tubular Bells and say where this next well is. But let me just give you general of where we are right now. So with the current wells and wells fee off, we're approximately around 15,000 barrels a day here producing at Tubular Bells. There will be a shutdown in the third quarter at T-Bells, and then we are not going to remediate this well C, which is approximately 5,000 barrels a day net to us in the fourth quarter. So just with that well you're getting to the 20,000 or a little above when we have the wells together. Then with this next producer we'll come on and we'll give you information, because we're not \u2013 I'm not sure exactly when that's going to come on at this point right now.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's fair enough. And just a quick follow-up, is the $300 million or so of capital that you took out of this year's budget where did that come from?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I was saying this earlier. So we did \u2013 it's basically the majority is cost reductions and it is literally across our portfolio. So there's not one significant item. It's in exploration, it's in production, and it's in development. So, again, the majority from that with some deferral of activity as well, so there's really no big names or big assets that I could point you to from that. It's just continuing to drive down costs across the portfolio.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay Wilson","Thank you, Amanda. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","As usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John Hess","Thank you, Jay. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I will review our progress in executing our strategy, Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will then review our financial results.","Our strategic priorities are; first, to invest only in high return low cost opportunities. Through 2025, we plan to allocate about 75% of our capital expenditures to our Guyana and Bakken assets, two of the highest return investment opportunities in the industry.","Second, we have built a focused portfolio with a combination of short-cycle and long-cycle investment opportunities with Guyana and Bakken as our growth engines and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Thailand is our cash engines.","As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, our portfolios position to deliver approximately 20% compound annual cash flow growth and more than 10% compound annual production growth through 2025 with a portfolio breakeven of less than $40 per barrel Brent by 2025.","Third, we will continue to ensure that we have the financial capacity to fund our world-class investment opportunities and maintain an investment grade credit rating. We entered 2019 with 2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, 95,000 barrels of oil per day hedged in 2019 with $60 WTI put options and the spending flexibility to reduce our capital program by up to $1 billion should oil prices move lower on a sustained basis.","Fourth, we are focused on growing free cash flow in a disciplined and reliable manner. We are adding an exciting inflection point, transitioning from an investment phase in 2019 to a free cash flow generation phase beginning in 2020 with a start-up of the Liza Phase 1 development offshore Guyana, followed by the Bakken growing to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021. And then the Liza Phase 2 start-up offshore Guyana by mid-2022 with an additional ship planed in Guyana for each year thereafter through 2025.","Finally, as our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will prioritize return of capital to shareholders through dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. As we execute our strategy, we will continue to be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability in terms of safety, protecting the environment, and social responsibility.","A key driver of our strategy is Guyana where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. In December, we announced the tenth discovery on the block at Pluma. As a result of this new discovery, and further evaluation of previous discoveries, the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the block was increased to more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent with multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential.","Earlier this month, drilling began on the Haimara-1 exploration well, 19 miles east of the Pluma-1 discovery and on the Tilapia-1 exploration well in the Turbot area. The Liza Phase 1 development is on track to start-up in early 2020. Project sanction for Liza Phase 2 is expected in the first quarter of 2019 with start-up expected by mid-2022.","Sanctioning of a third development Payara is expected towards the end of 2019 with start-up, as early as 2023. Also, key to our strategy is the Bakken. Our largest operated growth asset where we have more than a 15-year inventory of high return drilling locations. Our transition to plug-and-perf completions should increase net present value of the asset by approximately $1 billion.","Net production is expected to grow to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021, generating approximately $750 million of annual free cash flow post 2020 at current oil prices.","Now, turning to our 2018 financial results. Our adjusted net loss was $176 million, compared to a loss of $1.4 billion in 2017, and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $2.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion in the prior year.","In 2018, we delivered proved reserve additions of $172 million net barrels of oil equivalent representing an organic replacement rate of 166% at an F&D cost of just under $12 per barrel of oil equivalent. The majority of these additions were in the Bakken.","Proved reserves at the end of the year stood at 1.19 billion barrels of oil equivalent and our reserve life was 11.5 years. Full-year 2018 production was 257,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Pro forma for our asset sales and Libya, our production was 248,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018, 10% higher than the pro forma 224,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day produced in 2017.","In 2019, our production is forecast to average between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Bakken net production is forecast to average between 135,000 and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019.","In summary, we are extremely well-positioned to deliver increasing and strong financial returns, visible and low risk production growth, and significant future free cash flow, the majority of which will be deployed towards increased return of capital to our shareholders. ","I will now turn the call over to Greg.","Greg Hill","Thanks, John. 2018 was a year of strong operational execution and continued delivery of our strategy. We delivered production of 250,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018, excluding Libya, which exceeded our original production guidance of 245,000 to 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was achieved within our capital guidance of 2.1 billion and even after accounting for the sale of our JV interest in the Utica, which reduced full-year 2018 net production by approximately 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus guidance.","In Guyana, on the 6.6 million-acre Stabroek Block where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we continued our extraordinary run as exploration success with five further major discoveries over 2018 at Ranger, Pacora, Longtail, Hammerhead and Pluma.","In December, the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block were increased to more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from about 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent a year ago. The growing resource base on the block reinforces the potential for at least five floating production storage and offloading vessels or FPSOs, producing more than 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025.","Guyana is world-class investment opportunity in every respect. The combination at scale, exceptional reservoir quality, shallow producing horizons, and timing of the development in the cost cycle provide industry-leading breakevens, which is key to moving Hess towards a $40 per barrel Brent breakeven oil price by 2025, while delivering significant growth in returns on invested capital and cash flow generation.","In the Bakken, we have a 15-year inventory of drilling locations that can on average generate IRRs of more than 50% at $60 per barrel WTI. Through field trials and an independent study, we confirmed that our planned transition to plug-and-perf completions in 2019 from our previous 60 stage sliding sleeve design is significantly value accretive.","Based on these results, we expect production to grow to approximately 200,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021, after which the asset should generate approximately $750 million of free cash flow annually at current prices through the middle of the next decade. In 2018, we also brought further focus to our portfolio by successfully closing on the sale of our JV interest in the Utica shale play to Ascent Resources for approximately $400 million in late August.","Now, turning to production. In the fourth quarter, production averaged 267,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance of approximately 265,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day on the same basis.","For the full-year 2019, we forecast production to average between 270,000 and 280,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which on a pro forma basis is approximately 10% above 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, we forecast production to average approximately 270,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Now, turning to the Bakken. In the fourth quarter, production averaged 126,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represented an increase of approximately 15% over the year ago quarter and above our previous guidance of 125,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full-year 2018, production averaged 117,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in-line with full-year guidance of 115,000 to 120,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. ","For the full-year 2019, we forecast our Bakken production to average between 135,000 and 145,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day approximately 20% above 2018 levels. In the first quarter of 2019, we expect Bakken production to average approximately 130,000 to 135,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2019, we plan to drill approximately 170 wells and bring approximately 160 new wells online, compared to 121 wells drilled and 104 wells brought online in 2018.","Moving offshore in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production averaged approximately 68,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 57,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2018 above our guidance, reflecting strong performance from our new Penn State Deep 6 well and the early return to production of the Conger field. We forecast 2019 production from our deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets to average between 65,000 and 70,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day.","At the Malaysia Thailand joint development area and the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess has a 50% interest, production averaged 35,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 36,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2018.","At the North Malay Basin, also on the Gulf of Thailand, net production averaged 28,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter and 27,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2018. Combined production from our JDA and North Malay Basin assets is forecast to average between 60,000 and 65,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2019.","Turning to Guyana. Earlier this month the Stena Carron drillship began drilling the Haimara-1 well, located 19 miles east of the Pluma-1 discovery and the Noble Tom Madden drillship began drilling a second well, Tilapia-1, located 3 miles west of the Longtail-1 discovery, both in the southeastern part of the Stabroek Block. We expect to have results from both of these Wells shortly.","Following completion of drilling operations on these wells, the Stena Carron will conduct a drill stem test at the Longtail discovery and the Noble Tom Madden will drill an additional exploration well on the Turbot area, likely Yellowtail. Beyond these wells, 2019 drilling on the Stabroek Block is expected to include appraisal of the Hammerhead and Ranger discoveries, and further exploration and appraisal in the Turbot area.","Additional prospects and play types on the block, where we continue to see multibillion barrels of exploration upside, will also be prioritized for the drill schedule. The Liza Phase 1 development is progressing the schedule, drilling of Phase 1 development wells in the Liza field by the Noble Bob Douglas drillship is well advanced.","Subsea equipment is being prepared for installation, and the topside facilities modules are being installed on the Liza Destiny FPSO in Singapore. Preparations are underway for the installation of subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines in the second quarter and the Liza Destiny FPSO is expected to sale from Singapore and arrive offshore Guyana in the third quarter of 2019. Also, as mentioned earlier, we continue to expect sanction of Liza Phase 2 in the first quarter and the Payara development to be sanctioned later this year.","In closing, I believe that we have built distinctive capabilities and created a world-class portfolio that together will enable us to deliver industry-leading performance and significant shareholder value for many years to come.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John Rielly","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the third quarter of 2018, and provide guidance for 2019. We incurred a net loss of $4 million in the fourth quarter, compared to a net loss of $42 million in the third quarter. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, results in the fourth quarter were a net loss of $77 million, compared to net income of $29 million in the previous quarter, resulting primarily from lower realized crude oil prices.","Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $5 million in the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $109 million in the third quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2018 were as follows: Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $122 million. Lower exploration cost improved results by $78 million. Higher DD&A expense reduced results by $58 million. All other items reduced results by $12 million for an overall reduction in fourth quarter results of $114 million.","Turning to Midstream. The midstream segment had net income of $32 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $30 million in the third quarter of 2018. Midstream EBITDA before the noncontrolling interest amounted to $127 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $130 million in the previous quarter.","After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $122 million in the third quarter of 2018. On an adjusted basis after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $110 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to our financial position. Excluding midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.6 billion, total liquidity was $7 billion, including available committed credit facilities, and debt was $5,691 million at December 31, 2018. Cash flow from operations before working capital changes was $584 million, while cash expenditures for capital were $664 million in the fourth quarter. ","Changes in working capital increased cash flows from operating activities by $297 million in the fourth quarter, due to an increase in accounts payable and a reduction in accounts receivable. In the fourth quarter, we purchased $250 million of common stock, which completed our previously announced $1.5 billion stock repurchase program.","Now turning to guidance, we project E&P cash cost, excluding Libya to be in the range of $12.50 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2019, and $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for full-year 2019, which includes costs for pre-production activities for Guyana Phase 1 and pre-development costs for future phases.","DD&A expense, excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2019, and for the full-year of 2019. This results in projected total E&P unit operating cost, excluding Libya of $30.50 to $32.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and $31 to $33 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full-year 2019.","As guided earlier, capital and exploratory expenditures in 2019 are expected to be $2.9 billion. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million in the first quarter with full-year 2019 forecast to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million. The midstream tariff is expected to be approximately $170 million in the first quarter with full-year 2019 projected to be in the range of $750 million to $775 million.","The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya is expected to be an expense in the range of 0% to 4% for the first quarter and full-year 2019. Our 2019 crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We have 95,000 barrels of oil per day hedged for calendar 2019 with $60 WTI put option contracts. We expect option premium amortization will be approximately $29 million per quarter in 2019.","For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $35 million in the first quarter with full-year 2019, expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million.","Turning to corporate, for the first quarter of 2019, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, and full-year guidance to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. Interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million in the first quarter and in the range of $315 million to $325 million for the full-year of 2019. This concludes my remarks.","We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. John Rielly, the CapEx plan obviously hasn't changed given you only just put out a few weeks back, but given the dynamics of the oil price what would it take, I guess given the hedge position you are in, what would it take for you to need to cut, I guess going into perhaps the second half of this year, what I'm really thinking is, obviously oil prices are well below where they were when you set the budget, I'm just curious if you\u2019ve got any contingency plan just to where the flexibility would come?","John Rielly","Sure, Doug. I mean, as we laid out at our Investor Day, we do have this long-term strategy and we do intend to continue to execute it. We really feel that we have the portfolio on a really nice place from the asset sales and we\u2019re really \u2013 now this portfolio can deliver the 10% production growth and the 20% cash flow growth as John Hess mentioned earlier. So, the only thing that we can't predict with this, with our portfolio is commodity prices. So, all we\u2019re doing now is trying to manage uncertainty. So, what did we do with proceeds from the asset sales?","We\u2019ve left $2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet and we have the hedges in place for 2019 and that\u2019s 95,000 barrels of oil per day with the $60 floor price and that\u2019s WTI. So, the company is well-positioned to deliver that strategy even in this low-price environment. Now, if we get extended in an extended low-price environment and really would have to go really more into 2020, the tail-end of 2019 into 2020, in that case an extended low-price environment we have the flexibility as we mentioned to reduce our annual CapEx by as much as $1 billion and that\u2019s principally by reducing rigs in the Bakken. But right now, our plan is to execute with six rigs in the Bakken and deliver everything that we said that we laid out in Investor Day.","Doug Leggate","Okay. I appreciate. Obviously, we\u2019re not expecting at this point, but we will keep an eye on it. My follow-up if I may is on exploration and it\u2019s kind of couple of part question, I guess. The Tom Madden as I understand was only contracted for 2 well slots, I was just wondering if that has now been extended and if so, what do you have in the plan for this year by way of total exploration wells? And I realize that can move around, but well test and so on, and if I may just on that last point, Greg, I wonder if you could just characterize Haimara for us in terms of scale, it looks like it's a big green block to the east of the Turbot-Longtail, but as you probably saw from the other day, our understanding is that service sector is telling is that is already under test, which would imply discovery. So, any confirmation or color you can offer around that would be appreciated? Thanks.","Greg Hill","Yes, thanks Doug. So, Haimara\u2019s operations are currently underway and as we said in our opening remarks, we expect to announce something on that shortly, as well as the Tilapia well. Regarding the Tom Madden, yes, we plan to use that rig throughout 2019. We really have, without talking about specific well numbers because again it does depend on kind of what we find in testing and etcetera as we go forward, but our main objectives on the block this year are really threefold. One is, to appraise Hammerhead; second is to appraise Ranger; and then our third objective is to continue to explore\/appraise around Turbot. And the purpose of those three objectives is really to underpin vessels four and five, where are they, how big are they, et cetera. So, those are our main objectives this year, and we\u2019ll do that with two rigs in the exploration\/appraisal theater.","Doug Leggate","Just to be clear, the $200 million guide that\u2019s a G&G cost not a dry hole cost, right?","John Rielly","I'm sorry Doug, the 200 million guide from\u2026?","Doug Leggate","Yes, the guidance that you suggested I think for exploration, that is G&G, not dry hole?","John Rielly","Okay. So, exploration spend for 2019 is going to be $440 million that\u2019s what we laid out in Investor Day.","Doug Leggate","Sorry. I thought I [indiscernible].","John Rielly","Oh, so are you talking from my \u2013 when my guidance that I give out, we give exploration expenses without dry hole costs, so, that\u2019s the expense. The capital spend for exploration will be approximately $440 million in 2019.","Doug Leggate","Right. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer","Thank you, good morning.","John Hess","Good morning.","Brian Singer","Wanted to follow-up actually on the point on Guyana you were just talking about with regards to appraisal, so what degree does the appraisal program over the next 6 months to 9 months, as you said, just underwrite FPSO is 4 to 5 versus open up the door for additional FPSOs beyond 5 or it is the emphasis on the plus \u2013 5 plus FPSOs expansion beyond 5 contingent on additional exploration as opposed to appraisal success?","John Hess","Yes, Brian. So, the answer is both. I mean, as I said in my remarks earlier, one of the primary intentions though with the program this year is to underpin vessels 4 and 5. So, where are they? We know that there will be one or more potentially in the Turbot complex so it is likely to be one or more on the Hammerhead, and then finally Ranger or how does that play in and when does it play in. And as you mentioned, we will additionally be doing additional exploration on new prospectivity on the block above and beyond that. So, it\u2019s really both, but we\u2019re anxious to get 4 and 5 underpinned, obviously, because we want to keep the cadence of design one, build many, kind of, a ship a year coming online. So, it\u2019s important to understand where those are, get them engineered, get them designed, and more importantly how big to build them.","Brian Singer","Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is that with regards to the Bakken, can you just give us the latest that you're seeing in terms of the service cost environment of may be unrelated to your shift to the plug-and-perf, but just more of the service cost environment in the Bakken and then what you're currently seeing on the realization front? Thank you.","John Hess","Yes. So, I\u2019ll take the service cost. So, I guess first point Brian is, you know the Bakken is very different than the Permian. It\u2019s a more regional market. Therefore, it\u2019s not experiencing the level of cost inflation that the Permian is seeing. Now, having said that, we\u2019re seeing an average cost increase of 5% to 10% on average in the Bakken in 2019. Most of that\u2019s in the form of higher labor cost, but having said, we\u2019re confident that with the combination of the performance-based service contracts we've established with our suppliers or many of our suppliers and our lean-manufacturing capabilities we will be able to cover all of that inflation. So, from a well cost guidance standpoint, we're very confident we\u2019ll deliver what we promised, in spite of the inflation.","John Rielly","And just Brian to your question on the realizations, they are back to normal in the Bakken. So, during the fourth quarter, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Clearbrook spread moved from a plus $0.78 of the [TI] to minus $8.30 per barrel and that was due to about 1 million barrels of demand going away just due to refinery maintenance. So, now like the refineries are back online, the differentials are back around normal. They\u2019ve been a dollar above to a dollar under and so we\u2019re just seeing more of the normal type of Bakken differentials. And if I can just add again, our strategy is to have multiple export markets there to provide us flexibility to move our oil into the highest value market. So, we can get about 70% of our oil to the coast to get the Brent influenced pricing. So \u2013 and that\u2019s through a combination of our firm transportation of pipelines in rail.","Brian Singer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Ryan Todd of Simmons Energy. Your line is open. And Mr. Todd, you line might be on mute, your line is open.","Ryan Todd","Sorry, I apologize for that. A couple of quick questions on the Bakken. Of the 35 wells that you brought under in the fourth quarter how many of those if any were plug-and-perf and can you comment on how early production looks relative to expectations in your targeted type curve for the 2019 program?","John Hess","So, in the fourth quarter it was 13 were plug-and-perf that came online and as we said basically going forward, it\u2019s almost 100%. We could have had some carryover sliding sleeves being coming online, but really all our program is plug-and-perf. I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg on performance in the plug-and-perf.","Greg Hill","Sorry. I was on mute for a second. Just a reminder, the high intensity plug-and-perf completions are expected to deliver a 15% to 20% increase in IP 180. At least a 5% increase in EUR. That increase is our plateau production to 200,000 barrels a day from the previously guided 175. And importantly an increase in overall Bakken NPV by over $1 billion at $60 per barrel WTI, and what I will say is that results so far indicate that we are meeting or beating expectations on IP rates. So, we\u2019re in good stead going forward.","Ryan Todd","Alright. It\u2019s good to hear and maybe any near-term impacts from the weather, and you had a relatively strong oil mix in the fourth quarter as well, I know that bounces around every time is ask you from quarter-to-quarter, but anything on those two things?","John Hess","Now there has been some minor weather impacts. You know, it\u2019s extremely cold. So, the polar vortex is alive and well in North Dakota just like the rest of the nation, but we expect to recover from all that as normal.","Greg Hill","And then, just going to the oil cut too and I know the way you asked your question you\u2019re right. I mean oil cut is going to fluctuate quarter-on-quarter really due to changes in gas volumes captured, NGL's extracted and also NGL pricing, but just from our guidance standpoint, we do expect to average in the low-to-mid 60% range for the foreseeable future. So, the increase in Q4 relative to our gas it was driven by lower gas was gathered because we did have Tioga Gas Plant maintenance in the quarter, and that drove up the oil cut.","Ryan Todd","Perfect. I appreciate the help. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. ","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter.","John Hess","Thank you.","Jeffrey Campbell","I was just wondering could you add some, kind of color with regard to the Guyana, 2019 well test program, you know how specifically how that\u2019s going to help you to confirm or eliminate development options for the future?","John Hess","Well, I think, you know the purpose of the testing program, the primary purpose is always to establish reservoir continuity. So, is there compartmentalization or anything like that going on so far. All of our drill stem tests have indicated very good reservoir continuity everywhere we go. So, that\u2019s important as you think about vessels 4 and 5 to have some tests under your belt to understand how many wells will it take to evacuate those reservoirs. So that will be the purpose again, if looking at 4 and 5 and the majority of the testing will be dedicated to that or new discoveries that we would like to get drill stem testing, while we\u2019re there.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, thank you. And I was just wondering, could you comment broadly on the distribution of the drilling and completions in your best areas such as Keene and Stony Creek versus East Nesson and Beaver Lodge in 2019? Just kind of wondering how you're going to distribute the rigs around the completion?","John Hess","Yes. So, if you think about the 160 wells online that we're going to drill, about 45 of those would be in Keene, about 30 or more be in Stony Creek, 40 or so will be in East Nesson, and then 20 will be in the Beaver Lodge, kind of [cap area], and then we have another 25 miscellaneous wells that are really spread out to try different loadings etcetera. So, kind of test wells in other parts of the field.","Jeffrey Campbell","On the 25, is that \u2013 I know that other operators in the Bakken have talked about this as well, is that sort of an effort to try more moderate completions may be in areas where you haven\u2019t done it recently to see if you can push those EURs up?","John Hess","Yes. I think so. You know those 25 wells, we\u2019re going to be about 11 in Goliath and 14 in Red Sky. So, really that as you kind of move out, how do we think about profit loading and potentially even spacing in those areas of the field. So, we want to get some of that experience under our belt this year. But if you look at the program for this year, the IP 180's are going to average 120 to 125. And certainly, the EURs will be well north of 1 million barrels for the program. So, good healthy program and returns in the 50% to 100% range.","Jeffrey Campbell","Great. I appreciate that color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Bob Brackett","Hi, good morning. Could you talk in terms of Guyana, the pending government and regulatory approvals. How do you see the milestones coming through the first quarter and are they influenced by the election down in Guyana?","John Hess","Let\u2019s handle it two ways. With the recent no-confidence vote in elections still being scheduled, there is absolutely no impacts to our exploration or development activities. Liza Phase 1 remains on track to achieve first oil in early 2020. And we also expect Liza Phase 2 to start up by mid-2022. The government on the final approval on plan of development it\u2019s just a question of getting a third-party engineering firm in place, which is underway to work with ExxonMobil to basically vet the details of the plan of development and we anticipate getting that in the first quarter and moving forward, but I think the important thing there Bob is that \u2013 all steam ahead.","Bob Brackett","Yes. That\u2019s clear. Related follow-up that the F&D of under $12 a barrel is quite strong. If you look back to the 2017, that was an amazing $5 a barrel as those Liza bookings came through. How do we think about the cadence of Guyana reserves booking either on project sanction or then production-related revisions as we go forward?","Greg Hill","Sure, Bob. We really believe we\u2019ve got competitive advantage with our reserve resource and backlog basically. One, just so you know we only have 40 million barrels of Guyana booked at this point, and as Exxon says there\u2019s greater than 5 billion barrels discovered. And it is this cadence because with the cadence we have the sanction of the Phase 1. We\u2019ve booked the approximately 40 million barrels and did not book any barrels here in 2018. So, when Phase 2 as John says get sanctioned, we will pick up barrels then. Phase 3 is Exxon is same by the end of the year. We\u2019ll pick up those barrels. Then also as we drill the production wells now for Phase 1 and begin to start-up performance on Phase 1, we\u2019ll be picking up additional reserves at that time. So, from a reserve standpoint, Guyana will be the gift that keeps on giving for us here over the time because as John Hess mentioned earlier, as we expect to have these phases come on once every year, we\u2019ll continue to record additional reserves every year as this moves out and you saw the low F&D cost associated with that. So, little on the scale and just the uniqueness of the low-cost reserves it just puts us in a terrific competitive advantage.","Bob Brackett","Great. And thanks for that color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Roger Read","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to follow-up on some of the Guyana stuff, can you talk to us a little bit about, I guess what some of the issues we should watch for in terms of completion and delivery of the destiny vessel and then anything else on the development drilling or any other critical equipment timelines we should be watching to remain comfortable with the early 2020 start-up?","John Hess","Yes. So, I think as I mentioned in my opening remarks, you know the cadence of when the vessel will show up and whatnot, we\u2019re on schedule to do that, so there are no issues foreseen yet. We are on schedule to get the vessel on location. I think the next key thing to watch is all of the surf activities that really start in the second quarter in Guyana. So, those are key activities, but we are \u2013 based on the project progress to date, we are on schedule to deliver oil in early 2020. Then you will ramp those wells up over a 4-month to 6-month period so it won't be an instantaneous ramp. The reason for that is you will bring them on flow just to make sure that you don't have any say in control issues. So, there will be a ramp of 4-months to 6-months, according to the operator.","Roger Read","Yes, of course understand that. And then just one last question on balance sheet flexibility, obviously hedged up for this year the 95,000 barrels, I was curious is there and you may have mentioned this, I may have just missed this in the original commentary, but what\u2019s been done or could be done for 2020 or what do envision maybe needing to do for 2020, if the opportunity to hedge at $60 would represent itself again?","Greg Hill","Yes. We will continue to look to add hedges as we move into 2020 or 2021. As I said earlier, we\u2019re just looking to manage the uncertainty, and we do like to have that healthy insurance to ensure our program and continue to be executed because, as I said earlier, we really like where the portfolio is right now and what it can deliver that 10% production growth and 20% cash flow growth. So, with the 95,000 barrels a day hedged at the $60 WTI floor for 2019, once we look to 2020, we will look to put on hedges as well to add insurance.","John Hess","And I think it\u2019s important to know that the structure we\u2019d use would be similar where we protect the downside, but we don't cap the upside.","Roger Read","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng","Hi, guys. Good morning.","John Hess","Good morning.","Paul Cheng","John Rielly, I have to apologize, you gave a number about amortization cost per quarter for the hedges is that 29 million after tax?","John Hess","Yes. That is 29 million after tax?","Paul Cheng","Okay. And John just curious that, I mean, have you or Exxon have ever reached out to the opposition party and see what is their current view about contract and everything?","John Hess","Yes. So, you know that both major parties, the current ruling party, as well as the opposition party have stated that they are supportive of the development and have consistently stated their intention to honor our PSCR contract.","Paul Cheng","And based on the current trend, when the consortium will start to developing the natural guess for the local market?","Greg Hill","Paul, that project is still under review and under discussion with the government and we were doing some early engineering studies to figure out what it will take, but in any case, it will be a small amount \u2013 relatively small amount of gas going onshore in the main to deliver to a gas fired power plant. But that project has not been sanctioned. It\u2019s still under feasibility studies and whatnot.","Paul Cheng","Great comment. So, that saved me some reading through the entire PSC, is that being specified in the PSC in terms of this scoop and the when that gets the market and need to be developed?","Greg Hill","No. All that\u2019s still under discussion with the government.","Paul Cheng","Okay. So, that is actually subject to discussion is not framed into PSC?","Greg Hill","No. I think we\u2019ve agreed for the necessity for it, but timing and how it all is going to work and all that is yet to be determined.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And at Bakken, at 200,000 barrel per day of the peak, many years that you can sustain based on the [full rigs]?","Greg Hill","4 to 5.","Paul Cheng","4 to 5 rigs. I mean how many years [indiscernible]?","Greg Hill","Based on what we know today. I mean 4 rigs, but 4 to 5 years at a peak, you know obviously based on what we know today, you know completion technology could get better. I mean there\u2019s lots of things that could get better that could extend that?","Paul Cheng","But the current base on what you know today the resource is 4 years to 5 years on that?","Greg Hill","Right. That\u2019s roughly 200,000 barrel a day peak. At a 4-rig level, so let me be clear about that?","Paul Cheng","Yes. John Rielly on the Midstream, can you tell us what is the expected CapEx for 2019 and 2020?","John Rielly","For 2019, the Midstream has put out its guidance. It\u2019s 275 million to 300 million of CapEx for Midstream. There is some small amounts that are in that Midstream related to water assets, because you know the water asset sale is expected to close in the first quarter. That\u2019s approximately 25 million to 30 million on top of that, but that\u2019s the gross amount that I was giving you.","Paul Cheng","Okay. How about 2020, any kind of rough number?","John Rielly","No. We don't have guidance out on that. So, again, it will depend all on our plans, as well as any potential third-party opportunities that the Midstream has.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Payne of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Ross Payne","How are you doing guys? Obviously, Venezuela got involved with Exxon\u2019s exploration ship on the very western part of the Guyana border, can you give us an update on when you think that will be resolved through the UN? Thank you.","John Hess","Drilling and development operations in offshore Guyana are unaffected by the incident that involved the seismic acquisition vessels on Saturday, December 22 when the vessels were approached by the Venezuelan Navy. The area where the incident occurred is more than 110 kilometers from the Ranger discovery, the closest of our 10 oil discoveries, and approximately 190 kilometers from the Liza development area. So, the point is, our drilling and development operations in offshore Guyana are unaffected by that incident.","And I think it\u2019s also important to know that exploration and development drilling is continuing in the Southeast area of the Stabroek Block. Greg just talked about that. The activities related to Liza Phase 1 development, which is expected to be producing up to 120,000 barrels oil a day in early 2020 also unaffected. And in terms of where it goes from here, it will be going to an international court. The UN fully supports Guyanese position. The United States supports the Guyanese position, as well as the CARICOM. So, this is an issue that is diplomatic that will have to be handled through the court, but at the end of the day we're very optimistic and encouraged that the Guyanese position will prevail.","Ross Payne","Okay, thank you very much. One more question on the Bakken, can you, it sounds like you can get about 70% of your barrels to the Gulf, what percentage is pipeline versus rail and is that mix going to change at all in 2019 or 2020?","John Hess","So, what we have right now is approximately 50,000 barrels a day that goes on DAPL. So that can get to Patoka, it can get to [Netherland], you can export from there. Then we have approximately from the rail that can go east, west or Gulf Coast. You've got like 25,000 to 30,000 barrels a day on rail that we can move. So that's basically how we get to the Gulf \u2013 to the various coasts and get the Brent-link pricing. ","And we will \u2013 there are multiple potential expansions going out such as DAPL and we'll continue to look to keep that competitive advantage as our Bakken production grows to again access more of those Gulf \u2013 I keep saying Gulf, but coast pricing to get Brent-link pricing on our crude. So, we are looking at some of these expansions such as DAPL.","Greg Hill","So, you looked at the future of the majority of our movements to market our Bakken crude will be through pipeline and the rail will be there for flex.","Ross Payne","Okay, perfect. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Pavel Molkanov of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Pavel Molkanov","Thanks for taking the question guys. Back to the general topic of takeaway capacity in the Bakken, any issues with gas flaring or anything around those lines that are facing constraints as you continue to ramp volumes?","John Hess","No, we don't anticipate any gas flaring restrictions as we ramp our volumes. We have adequate capacity in place.","Pavel Molkanov","Okay. And then just a quick one on buyback, having completed the previous authorization in Q4 as you mentioned is it fair to say that no additional buyback is envisioned as part of the 2019 capital allocation?","Greg Hill","Our first second and third priority is to maintain a strong cash and balance sheet position, ample liquidity to ensure that we can fund our world-class investment opportunities in Guyana and the Bakken without the need for further debt or equity financing by the way. As we transition from our investment phase and our portfolio begins to generate recurring free cash flow, and you go forward in time out to 2025. We plan to return the majority of that free cash flow to shareholders through higher dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.","Pavel Molkanov","Alright. Very good, appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of John Herrlin of Societie Generale. Your line is open.","John Herrlin","Hi, just some unrelated ones. With reserve additions this year you said they were primarily Bakken where most of the addition is extensions Greg?","Greg Hill","It was actually a mixture John of extensions and add. So, generally with the ads you're going to get the extra year in the five-year program, so we\u2019re going to get those ads. Then you get some of these technical ones where you could have had in a program well A, in the previous year and now well A, is out, you got well B, so you get ads versus revisions, but you do get the additional year of the pods and then you get some revisions pick up. The prices were higher, so you do pick up some revisions from that as well.","John Herrlin","Okay. Would you ever consider discussing your captive resource base given the fact that reserve additions are going to be lagged in Guyana and it\u2019s so large and you do have other resource potential elsewhere because it's not something you frequently discuss?","John Rielly","No. We don't \u2013 we typically don't discuss this like the 6P type resource number, but what we do and as we laid out on Investor Day and Exxon has laid out that we do have greater than 5 billion barrels growth in Guyana. Obviously, we have a 30% working interest. So, people can get the scale of that and as I mentioned we only have 40 million of that booked right now.","And then in the Bakken, obviously with our 15-year well inventory that we have with greater than 50% returns and then we have obviously an inventory of well locations beyond that. So, that's how we give that flavor because to your point, we do believe we have a real good competitive advantage with our backlog, our resources and reserve position.","GregHill","Greg. And the estimated EUR in the Bakken is somewhere around 2.3 billion barrels there as well.","John Herrlin","Thanks, Greg. Since, John was answering a lot of the questions, where do you capitalize on this year in terms of interest expense for 2019?","GregHill","John, I'm going have to dig that one out.","John Herrlin","We can do it off-line that\u2019s fine.","GregHill","Yes, maybe I can get back to you off-line on exactly what that is.","John Herrlin","Yes. That's fine. And then the last one for me as for 2018 costs incurred. Could you give us a sense of what was exploration? What was development?","John Hess","So, from our cost incurred standpoint in 2018. Our exploration spend was $440 million.","John Herrlin","Okay, great. Thanks.","John Hess","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Nicole and I'll I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.","Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","On this morning's call, John Hess will make some high-level comments on the quarter and the progress we are making in executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then review our operations and John Rielly will discuss our financial results.","I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Our company has made important progress in maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping a tight control on our spending, while continuing to invest in future growth, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders.","Over the course of 2016, we have materially reduced our spending in response to this lower for longer oil price environment. We now project our full year 2016 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures to be approximately $2 billion, down $100 million from our previous forecast and more than 50% below 2015.","In addition, this month, we will complete a $1.5 billion refinancing of higher coupon debt, extending our average maturities and lowering our average coupon rate. This transaction further strengthens our balance sheet and liquidity position and defers any significant debt maturities until 2027. While we have reduced investment across our producing portfolio, we believe it is very important to continue to fund our growth projects in the Gulf of Thailand, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Guyana.","With regard to Guyana, we are very encouraged about the significant resource potential on the 6.6 million acres Stabroek block. The Liza-3 well was successful, encountering approximately 200 feet of net oil pay and the same high-quality reservoir encountered in the Liza-1 and Liza-2 wells. This result further confirms that Liza is a world-class resource and one of the industry's largest oil discoveries in the last 10 years.","With this information, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza to be at the upper end of the previously announced range of 800 million barrels of oil equivalent and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Pre-development planning is underway and we expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics at current oil prices.","In addition, we are in the early stages of evaluating the exploration potential on the Stabroek block. The drilling rig will next move to the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza, with results from this exploration well expected by the time of our next conference call. With regard to our two other offshore developments, North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, are on track to come online in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Together, they will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and transition from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company.","Turning to our financial results. In the third quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $339 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $340 million or $1.12 per common share compared to an adjusted net loss of $291 million or $1.03 per common share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas sales volumes and selling prices, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower operating costs and DD&A. Net production was 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the upper end of our guidance range for the quarter, while net production from the Bakken exceeded our guidance, averaging 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter.","Our Bakken team continues to deliver excellent operating results and returns in the core of the play, that are competitive with the Permian and Eagle Ford. In the third quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $4.7 million per well, 11% below the year-ago quarter, even as we transitioned from a 35-stage to a 50-stage completion design. Our high-quality Bakken acreage, industry-leading drilling and completion costs and advantaged infrastructure position our Bakken asset to be a major contributor to the company's future production and cash flow growth. With the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making initial preparations to increase our drilling activity in the play next year.","We will provide 2017 guidance. including capital and exploratory expenditures, as usual in January. In summary, our company remains well positioned for the current low oil price environment and for a recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheets and long-term growth outlooks among our peers, which we believe will deliver profitable growth and improving returns for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Greg.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an operational update and review our progress in executing our strategy. In the third quarter of 2016, we delivered strong operating performance and advanced our offshore developments and exploration activities. Starting with production, in the third quarter, we averaged 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the upper end of our guidance range of 310,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong performance across our producing assets. As a result, we reconfirm our full-year 2016 production guidance of 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya.","Turning to the Bakken, in the third quarter, production averaged 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter and 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. We drilled 21 wells and brought 22 wells online in the third quarter. For 2016, we now expect to drill approximately 70 wells and bring 100 wells online. This compares to last year, when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online. We currently have two rigs operating in the play. But as John mentioned, given the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making preparations to ramp up activity levels next year as prices recover.","In the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken production to average between 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting fewer new wells being brought online. For the full year 2016, we expect Bakken production to be approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Over the third quarter, we continued to optimize our completions from our current 50-stage design by successfully completing 53-stage and 57-stage wells and we are trialing a 60-stage well this quarter. Even with these higher stage count trials, we still reduced our average drilling and completion costs in the third quarter to $4.7 million per well. We expect the 50-stage completion design to yield a 7% uplift in EUR per well in the core of the play. Wells bought online in the third quarter are expected to deliver gross EUR per well of approximately 830,000 barrels of oil equivalent and we anticipate this will approach 1 million barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter.","In the third quarter, average 30-day IP rates from our Middle Bakken wells increased to 899 barrels of oil per day from 811 barrels of oil per day in the second quarter and we expect to see a further increase in the fourth quarter.","Moving to the Utica, net production for the third quarter held at 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter and 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016.","Now, turning to offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter compared to 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016. At the Conger field, in which Hess has a 37.5% working interest and is operator, we started a work-over to remediate a mechanical failure as announced in our second quarter call and anticipate the well returning to production in the first quarter of 2017.","At our Tubular Bells field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, we will commence water injection this quarter and are currently completing a fifth producer that we anticipate bringing online in the first quarter of 2017. We will also replace a third defective sub-surface valve in the fourth quarter and expect to have the well back online in the first quarter of 2017. As with other fields in the Mississippi Canyon area, Tubular Bells was also shut in for five days as a precaution for hurricane activity.","In Norway, the Aker BP-operated Valhall field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, continues to perform strongly with net production of 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on average in the third quarter compared to 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter.","At the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, the booster compression compressor tie-in was successfully completed during a planned shutdown. Net production averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the last year's third quarter, reflecting downtime associated with the compression tie-in and reduced entitlement.","In the fourth quarter, we expect net production to be back above 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to developments, at the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, we completed the installation of the topsides at three remote wellhead platforms which are part of the full field development project. We also completed the drilling of three development wells. The project is on schedule for completion in the third quarter of 2017, after which net production is expected to ramp up steadily to 165 million cubic feet per day.","At the Stampede development project in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully lifted and set the topsides deck on the haul. All major lifts are now complete, drilling operations continue to progress and first oil remains on schedule for 2018.","I'd now like to move to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the 6.6 million acre Stabroek block. On September 5, the operator ExxonMobil spud the Liza 3 well, located approximately 2.7 miles from the Liza-1 discovery well. Liza-3 was drilled in 600,000 feet of water and reached a TD of approximately 18,100 feet. The well encountered approximately 200 feet of net oil pay in the same high-quality reservoir encountered during other Liza wells.","This reservoir sequence is also confirmed to have a common pressure regime with that of the equivalent reservoir interval found in both Liza-1 and Liza-2. Based on the positive Liza-3 results, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza alone via the upper end of ExxonMobil's previously announced range of 0.8 billion barrels and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The operator then plans to drill an exploration well at the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza with results expected by late January. In parallel, we continue to progress predevelopment activities at Liza and expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017.","We remain excited not only by Liza, which is world-class in its own right, but also by the significant further exploration potential of the very large Stabroek block, which as a reminder, is the equivalent of approximately 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks.","In closing, I'm very pleased with our team who once again have delivered strong operational performance, relentless continuous improvement and some key milestones and results which we believe in combination will deliver one of the most exciting growth profiles among our large cap E&P peers over the next decade and beyond.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2016. The Corporation incurred a net loss of $339 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter. Excluding items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods, our adjusted net loss was $340 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with an adjusted net loss of $335 million in the second quarter.","Turning to E&P, on an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $285 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the third quarter and the second quarter of 2016 were as follows: Higher realized selling prices improved results by $3 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $33 million. Lower exploration expenses improved results by $26 million. All other items reduced results by $10 million for an overall increase in third quarter net loss of $14 million.","In the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were the same as production volumes, and therefore the timing of lifting had no impact on our financial results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 41% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 47% in the second quarter.","Turning to Bakken Midstream, third quarter net income of $13 million increased from $11 million in the second quarter, primarily due to lower operating cost and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream, before the non-controlling interest, amounted to $73 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $68 million in the second quarter.","Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $118 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $75 million in the second quarter. The third quarter results include an after-tax charge of $50 million for the premium paid to purchase 65% of our notes due in 2019.","Turning to cash flow for the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $309 million. The net increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $23 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $529 million. Net borrowings were $731 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $91 million. All other items resulted in a decrease in cash of $9 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $434 million.","Turning to cash and liquidity. Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion, total liquidity of $8.2 billion including available committed credit facilities and total debt of $6.7 billion at September 30, 2016. The increase in debt during the quarter was attributable to the partial completion of a refinancing transaction launched in September to improve the company's liquidity position by purchasing higher coupon bonds, redeeming near-term maturities and lowering go-forward interest expense. To accomplish the refinancing, the Corporation issued in September $1 billion of 4.3% notes due in 2027 and $500 million of 5.8% notes due in 2047. The company used $750 million during the third quarter to retire 8.125% notes with a carrying value of $670 million due in 2019.","In October, the company will use $625 million to redeem $300 million of notes due in 2017 and to retire notes with a carrying value of $259 million due in 2029 and 2031. As a result of this refinancing, we have no significant debt maturities until 2027. Pro forma for the notes purchased are redeemed in October and excluding the Bakken Midstream, our cash and cash equivalents were $2.9 billion and total debt was $6.1 billion at September 30, 2016. Our pro forma debt to capitalization ratio was 24.5%.","Now turning to guidance. Starting with E&P. Cash cost per E&P operations are projected to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter, which includes approximately $2 per barrel for planned work-over activity to replace defective subsurface valves at the Conger and Tubular Bells fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Full year cash costs are projected to be in the range of $16 per barrel to $16.50 per barrel which compares to previous full-year guidance of $16 per barrel to $17 per barrel. DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $26 per barrel to $27 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $26.50 per barrel to $27 per barrel for the full year which is down from previous full-year guidance of $27 per barrel to $28 per barrel. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $43.50 per barrel to $45.50 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $42.50 per barrel to $43.50 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full-year guidance of $43 per barrel to $45 per barrel.","The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.20 per barrel to $4.30 per barrel for the fourth quarter and $3.85 per barrel to $3.95 per barrel for the full year, consistent with previous guidance of $3.80 per barrel to $4 per barrel. Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million in the fourth quarter and $250 million to $260 million for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $260 million to $280 million. The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 36% to 40% for the fourth quarter and 40% to 44% for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of 41% to 45%.","Turning to Bakken Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter and $48 million to $53 million for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous full year guidance of $40 million to $50 million.","Turning to corporate, we expect corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the fourth quarter and $90 million to $95 million for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of $100 million to $110 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the fourth quarter and $200 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, everybody.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Morning.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","John, you've indicated in the past, I think, that sustained Brent prices near $60 would probably be needed for the company to consider a more assertive spending profile. And within this context, some of your peers and semi-peers have taken a little bit of a different tact recently and they've indicated that even if the oil price does increase that their spending is not going to rise through 2020 with capital return to shareholders instead and to reduce debt, et cetera. So, my question is how you guys are thinking about capital management over the medium term, if we have a scenario whereby the oil price does recover, and whether you feel that the balance between returns on capital and production growth and financial flexibility requires adjustment in relation to the past decade and if so, how should it change?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Well, Doug, thank you. As you know, our strategy in this lower for longer oil price environment has been to preserve our balance sheet, preserve our capability and preserve our growth options, so it's a balance, and we're about value, not volume. But with the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making initial preparations to increase activity levels once again in the Bakken next year. We'll provide detailed 2017 guidance, including capital and exploratory expenditures as usual in January. But we're going to stay fiscally disciplined. It's the balance sheet that's premier here to fund through the cycle, the excellent growth opportunities we have, both short cycle in the Bakken and longer cycle in Guyana. And as long as those opportunities offer superior financial returns to our shareholders, that will obviously command our capital going forward, with an eye to keeping the balance sheet in check as well as looking at over time offering competitive growth and increasing cash returns to shareholders as well. So, it's going to be a balance and it's going to be a function of oil price.","Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, John. Thanks a lot.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. John, I wonder if I could kick off with the Liza news this morning. With the step-out, the 2.7 mile step-out similar thickness, it looks like, it looks like you've got a really shallow incline on this discovery, I guess. My question is, have you hit lowest known oil yet, did you find the oil-water contact, and if I may, my understanding is you're staying on the well to deepen the well. Can you talk a little bit about what you're looking for and what the next steps might be?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, Doug, this is Greg. The well is still under evaluation. I mean, what we can say is that we found 200 feet of very nice quality oil sands consistent with the sands at Liza 1 and Liza 2. So we're going to have to wait until the well is fully evaluated. Regarding next steps on the well, you're right. We're deepening the well, sidetracking and deepening the well, going through some separate, but distinct deeper sand packages.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","I think the real takeaway there, Doug, to your point, Liza has gotten bigger. It's in excess of 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent and we believe offers very attractive financial returns at current prices, and that's the key point.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, just to be clear, you didn't find the oil-water contact or you did?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","We'll refer that question to the operator when you \u2013 ExxonMobil has their call on Friday, but obviously...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","...we're encouraged that we have a bigger resource here than before, so you can draw your own conclusions from that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Quick follow-up if I may, so you're talking about Payara by the next quarter's results, but that's three months away and these are apparently taking 45 days to drill. What's the \u2013 what should I read into the timing?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, I think, Doug, first of all, we've got to finish the current deepening that we're on with the current well. So, we're in operations right now on that well. We've got to finish that out and depending on obviously what we find, could dictate how long the well takes to complete. And then we'll move the rig over to Payara and begin drilling at Payara there, again, depending on what we find, will dictate how long it actually takes to finish the well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Last one from me, very quickly. A follow-on to Doug's question actually about the Bakken. I understand you're going to give guidance, John, early next year. But just curious what your objective is because you're still seeing declines in the field. Are you looking for stability or are you looking to grow the Bakken next year? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yes. Doug, it's going to be a function of financial returns. We said that until oil prices approached $60, it didn't make sense to accelerate volume for its own sake, but we see with the current improvement in oil prices for next year, that now we're making our plans to increase the rig count some. The exact definition of that, we'll give guidance as we finalize our plans at the end of the year. But the core of the core that we have with the low drilling and completion costs offer us returns that are competitive with the Permian and the Eagle Ford. So as oil prices have improved, we think it's going to make sense to really take a hard look at increasing our rig count for next year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks for taking my questions, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Back to Guyana, could you just add a little bit more color on the Payara prospect, how that compares versus at Liza and Skipjack and if there's any look on whether you would continue to go with one rig in Guyana next year or whether there would be something greater than that?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I think regarding the rig count, we're still finalizing all of our plans and budget with the operators. So it's too early to be specific on that. Again, with the Payara prospect, it's 10 miles northeast of the Liza-1 well. It's in a similar reservoir package that we've seen in Liza, but getting definitive beyond that, let's just wait and see the results of the well.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. And then shifting over to the Bakken, just a couple of follow-up questions on some of the capital allocations there. Is the decision to move forward or to consider and prepare for accelerating activity there just simply in line with the approaching $60 commentary or has there been a more material improvement in returns or a reduction in cost that is more secular that's lowering that breakeven? And then very broadly, how do you think about (32:31) the out spending of cash flow next year?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. On the Bakken, it's more a function of price and value, but obviously with the improving cost performance that we have as well as the expansion of our stages to 50 stages from 35 stages, all of which we think has prices improve off of very attractive returns on a short cycle basis to our shareholders. And so that's why it's being given serious consideration and a finalization of the drilling rig program will give you and when we announce our budget for next year in January.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Hey, Brian, if I could just add \u2013 Brian, if I could just add a little more color on what John said. If you look at the well inventory that we have in the Bakken, that generates a 15% after-tax or a higher return at $50, that is now over 900 wells. And to put that in context, that's increased by some 40% for that same $50 number last year. So, as John said, as well costs have come down and our IT rates have gone up as a result of going to higher stage counts, we're sitting on a very high-quality inventory of wells.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And you may have said both these points, but did you say or could you say what the well cost and EURs will be associated with the 50 stage, 50 stage Bakken well?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. So, I think as we said in our opening remarks, the EURs in the fourth quarter will approach a million barrels. The EURs in the Middle Bakken in the third quarter were just shy of 900,000 barrels and well costs continued to drop this quarter. They dropped from $4.8 million to $4.7 million in spite of the fact that we had a couple higher stage count trials, the 53 stage and the 57 stage count. So, we continue to make those lean manufacturing continuous improvement gains on the wells in spite of increasing \u2013 marginally increasing stage count.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Thanks. Maybe one quick one on the Bakken and then a follow-up somewhere else. In the past, you've talked about, I guess, trying to understand the trajectory for 2017 as well. In the past, you've talked about three rigs to four rigs to maintain production flat in the Bakken. Is that still the case or have the improvements you've talked about in terms of lowering costs and productivity improvements changed that at all?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. I think the \u2013 I think the three rigs to four rigs is appropriate. I think the only thing we can say is that number has moved closer to three than four, but it's still in between three and four to hold production flat.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then if we think about activity, you mentioned in your comments the likelihood of reaching FID earlier than 2017. What are the steps that need to be met between now and then in terms of \u2013 I know it's tough to say at this point, in terms of additional appraisal wells and activity that needed to be done that we can watch for in terms of hitting FID next year?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. I think that the biggest thing that needs to be done is really the completion of the FEED work and getting bids back from contractors, all those things, and then obviously finalizing your final well designs and locations and all those. So it's just normal project progression to reach the FID point.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","And I think the key point there is obviously Liza is a world-class resource, in excess of a billion barrels of oil equivalent. So we think we're at beyond the commercial threshold already at current prices.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Morning.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","My first question on Greg's opening comments, it sounded like the Bakken wells are showing progression in average 30-day IPs as you move to the 50-stage completions. You mentioned the Middle Bakken 30-day IPs yet, what do you see on the lower Three Forks? And I note that in the context of your ops report you just filed that had 843 barrels a day in the quarter for all ops wells. So I'm just trying to square the circle from what we're seeing in the third quarter and what we should see or expect in 4Q for that average 30-day IP?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Evan. Really the difference in the numbers I quoted in the third quarter results is the mix of Three Forks wells. So this quarter had a higher proportion of Three Forks wells in it. Those IPs in the Three Forks this quarter were around about 800 barrels a day or so. And we also had an operational issue where we had some production curtailment due to some road restrictions that adversely impacted some of those Three Forks wells. So it brought the average down on the Three Forks, but that's why we gave you the Middle Bakken numbers. Middle Bakken numbers were very strong, less impacted by the production curtailment. So, it was that mix that really caused the quarter-on-quarter reduction. But as we said in the fourth quarter, we're going to see particularly Middle Bakken EURs approaching that 1 million barrel number in the fourth quarter, so we should have a very strong fourth quarter in terms of EUR in the Bakken.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. And do you have an IP estimate for the 4Q kind of total operated as others were guiding for 900 barrels a day to 1,000 barrels a day, is that what we should expect?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah we just said that \u2013 again, that should approach that 1 million barrels in the fourth quarter IP rates.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Sorry, 1,000 barrels a day, 1 million barrel EURs, yeah.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And my second question is there appears to be success with higher proppant loading in the Bakken amongst your peers. I know you mentioned higher proppant loadings were less effective in your acreage before. Yet what is your current proppant load on that standard 50-stage completion and are you planning to test any higher loads or kind of test that thesis in line with some other operators in the basin? Thanks.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, so Evan, we think that the Bakken is really two different areas, right. So in the core of the core, we believe that sticking with sliding fleet completions and increasing that stage count as high as you can practically go, delivers the highest return. Now the proppant loading we're using in those areas, again, the core of the core is anywhere from 80,000 pounds to 110,000 pounds per stage and that just really depends on where we are because we have the data to kind of say, it's better to optimize that between 80,000 pounds and 110,000 pounds.","Now, as you move outside the core, we continue to evaluate other designs, which includes slickwater, plug and perf, high proppant volume completions. And what we ultimately decide there, and we'll begin testing some of those techniques, whatever technique gives us the highest return per BSU, that is the one we're going to select. And so, the reason for the differences are simply because in the core of the core, you're on the flexure of the structure, so you have an awful high amount of natural fracturing. So you just need less of a proppant load. As you get outside the core, there's less of that effect, so that's what drives these different completion designs outside the core.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Maybe one more if I could, I know the Hawkeye started up in the 3Q that affected the mix in the quarter, but any color on when that started and ramped up within the quarter, just to get a better view of what the forward run rate might look like on a mix \u2013 production mix in the Bakken?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah, if you look at the mix, again, the individual well GORs are unchanged. And so, nothing is going on in the field from a GOR level. What has changed though is just the overall mix of production as we bring more wells, gas and NGLs as we bring more of that into the plant. So previously flared volumes \u2013 we're gathering additional previously flared volumes and putting those into the plant. So that's what's really going on with our mix.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Was that \u2013 when in the quarter was the startup?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So now, Hawkeye is coming in on \u2013 in phases, right, so it will be completed in 2017. And really, I wouldn't say anything in particular with Hawkeye itself, it is, as Greg said, we are just continuing to hook up more and more of our pads where either they were previously flared, it's just hooking up to our own infrastructure and we even have small amounts that we hook up to other infrastructure as well, other third-party infrastructure. And that additional gathering is what is causing the gas rate and the NGL volumes to go up and just causing pure math on the percentages of crude. But as Greg said, there is no change of the mix at the wellhead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate it guys.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Congrats again on Liza, looks like a large aerial extent and lack of compartmentalization, I guess, a couple of quick questions on Liza. I mean, what recovery factor have you assumed to come up with the sort of range?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Evan (sic) [Ed], we're evaluating a whole number of different scenarios on development, so it's too early to talk about that, Ed.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. I mean it just seems that from the aerial extent, it seems larger potentially than even the range that has been given.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. As John said, it's in the upper range \u2013 upper end of the range that was quoted previously.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Gas content thus far?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Again, let's wait until the development gets sanctioned to be specific on exactly what the mix is. But it's got a very healthy GOR, which means it's going to have a good response from a recovery standpoint.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then switching topic and maybe this is more broadly strategic. I mean you're clearly creating value in Guyana at the pace which offshore exploration takes. You're seeing peers get rewarded from making acquisitions down in the Permian. Maybe just sort of from a strategic standpoint, talk a little bit about how you see the changing landscape and Hess's role in it given the mix of onshore shale that you have, the excitement that people have about the Permian and then you also have this offshore element?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. No, thank you. I think the way we look at it is obviously we're always looking to optimize the value of our portfolio in the normal course of our business. However, with the robust portfolio of captured growth opportunities that we have, balanced between, I'd say the shorter cycle, Bakken, which is low risk and high return, with returns competitive with the Permian that you just talked about, as well as the longer cycle Guyana that we think will have world-class financial returns as well, acquisitions are low on our priority list.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. Very clear.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. John, I think in the past, you guys have told about sustaining CapEx above $1.5 billion. Is that still the number or that number has changed?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","So, we look at it, if you're asking like a sustainable CapEx level that we talk about for maintaining flat production, like if you look at right now, we're around, as John mentioned earlier, $2 billion of capital this year. With that, we have North Malay Basin and Stampede coming online and that 35,000 barrels a day comes online in 2018. So, when that comes online, you could \u2013 from our production levels that we have, we'll basically be able to keep our production levels flat, maybe some slight growth with when you're putting in and spending that $2 billion.","So, I would say it's a range, right. You can do this like $1.75 billion to $2.4 billion type range of capital, all depending on your F&D cost that you have in a portfolio for us at our current production levels. So, we're producing 120 million, 130 million barrels a year. So, just using F&D and cost from that range can get you that general type of CapEx level.","Now, we can certainly lower that CapEx level and maintain like kind of cash flow neutrality if we wanted to do that, but that would affect your long-term production growth.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. Understand. I guess, for next year, what is the remaining spending for Stampede and North Malay going to be?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Sure, so we went into the year basically with about $700 million on both of these projects as a budget, $375 million on North Malay Basin, $325 million on Stampede. The North Malay Basin number will come down. So, we'll update you and give you the more specific number in January, but it's going to come down because as we said, it's going to start production in the third quarter. Now the Stampede number will go up because we have a second drilling rig coming into the field in January. And then once again, as we put our capital budget together in January, we'll update you on the specific numbers.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But, that combined is probably still pretty close to about $700 million then, right. Because what you go down in North Malay probably offset by the increase in Stampede, I presume?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. You don't want to be specific, but it would be \u2013 it's going to be in that range again just because there will be an increase in Stampede and a reduction in North Malay Basin. But obviously once the third quarter starts, we're beginning to get cash flow out of North Malay Basin. And that's really the key again for us, is this 35,000 barrels a day comes in in 2018 and they go from using $700 million of cash to generating cash, so we're getting that big cash flow inflection point for us coming in 2018 on.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. And just curious, I mean, that in the $1.75 billion to $2.4 billion, whatever is that number there, is on the 2017 budget. That in the past, given \u2013 particularly given now that you have no sizeable debt maturity until 2027, on a going forward basis, that if oil price rise and cash flow from operations start to be in excess of that level, should we assume you will eventually run a cash flow-neutral model, so whatever is the increase in the cash flow exceeding that level will get put back into the exploration or that into the CapEx, or that is not a totally good assumption?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","It goes back to what John Hess had said earlier, right. There is a balance of how we would use the additional cash flow. So, with our portfolio, you know we're oil-weighted, so a $1 move in oil prices gives us on an annual basis approximately $70 million of additional cash flow. So, we are in a position to really, with the recovery in oil prices, to benefit from it. So what we'll then do is go look at our short-term, our medium-term, and our long-term growth options that we know we have some very good return opportunities there, but we'll balance that with our balance sheet and making sure that stays strong and providing returns to shareholders. So, it will be a mix and we'll continually look at that mix to optimize it as we move forward.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And two final questions for me. One, Utica, I'm surprised that you actually would be slightly up sequentially, given you are no longer drilling any more wells. Just, Greg, are you start seeing the decline over there and what kind of recovery should we assume?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Paul, so on the \u2013 you know, if we look at how we've able to hold production flat, although we had a drilling break, we brought 14 new wells online in the second quarter and nine wells in the first quarter, so you're seeing that really carry-over of those wells that we completed in the second quarter, those five wells, sorry. So, just to be clear again, we brought 14 new wells online in 2016, nine wells in the first quarter and five wells in the second quarter, so, you're seeing some carryover there. We anticipate the decline will come and it will probably come in the fourth quarter and first quarter next year is when we'll start to see that decline.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","If you continue not going to have any rig over there, what kind of decline rate should we assume?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Just take a typical type curve in the Utica and you can predict pretty easily what that decline is going to be, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's fine. All right, thank you.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now open.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys. And that was helpful. I don't think you're going to get into these details yet, but the first phase of sanctioning at Liza, how would you describe Phase I, or is it just too early in your FEED studies to even get into, like how \u2013 the scope and size of the development of upwards of 1.4 billion barrels?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I think at this point, it's just too early. Obviously, as John said, the reservoir is in the upper end of the range and we're doing all kinds of development studies to try and figure out the most optimum way to begin development of the reservoir, so stay tuned, more to come.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And then with North Malay coming online next year, can you talk about the annual impact of amount of capital that you invested and then the flip of amount of cash flow, I know it's a half-year basis most likely, but like what that does to operating costs or just an absolute cash generation for the company, as that 50% comes online?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Sure. So when it comes online in the third quarter, the North Malay Basin field itself will carry very low cash cost. So from a cash cost standpoint, it's going to have a positive impact on our overall portfolio. Now the price is linked to high sulfur fuel oil there and it is only on a month lag, so is going to react to oil prices. And depending on where oil prices are \u2013 the amount of cash flow we get will increase or decrease depending on what's happening with oil prices. However, we do expect then as that's the third quarter coming in and then with Stampede coming on in 2018, I mean, I think the broader picture is, we're utilizing $700 million of cash right now and not getting any cash flow back. In 2018, that flips so; we're getting a \u2013 at least a pickup of $700 million of cash flow from those two projects. And again depending on prices, how much excess cash flow we get we'll see once we get to 2018. But again, that's why we're always looking and focus on keeping our balance sheet strong through 2017 whereas in 2018, we get this additional cash flow coming into our portfolio.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And then just on a very detailed question, your fourth quarter capitalized interest in G&A, do you have an expectation for that?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","It should be \u2013 it will be the same because our capitalized interest right now is related to the Stampede project, so that will actually continue along until Stampede starts up.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. Firstly, just a hopeful one on Guyana, when could we expect first production based on an FID next year?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","I think the best thing to do is refer that to the operator.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","That's what I'm \u2013 what I might end up with, I understand. Could you talk a little bit about firstly your hedging positioning, if there's anything to add there. Secondly, as far as I understand that you're planning to accelerate activity next year, but also maintain a strong balance sheet and I assume that would mean spending within cash flows. Are you therefore assuming higher oil prices next year or how do I square that circle? Thanks.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. The prices we're assuming and we'd give further definition on that when we announce our budget next year in January, is prices in the current range, priority is going to keep the balance sheet strong and our activity levels will reflect keeping that balance sheet strong. So further guidance and specifics, we'll give you in January.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Anything on hedging, John?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yes. So right now, we do not have any hedges outstanding and we continue to look at hedges on a regular basis and we'll assess whether to add them as we've done in the past. Basically it's insurance to ensure funding of our capital projects. So then as John mentioned, as we look in 2017 and seeing where prices are, if we begin to put more capital back to work or add more drilling rigs in the Bakken, we will be considering adding hedging at that point as insurance.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Clear. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Campbell of the Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. My first question was with regard to the Bakken and the increase to 50 stages in the standard completion design. I was just wondering, do you anticipate any alteration of your current well spacing assumptions on pads as a result of the more intensive completions?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, we don't. Based on the \u2013 on our current reservoir studies, with this completion design, we think that's the optimum. Now having said that, we've done a few very close, even closer space pilots and we're waiting on the results of those. So it's too early to speculate one way or the other. But right now, we believe that nine in eight configuration, with the 500 foot well spacing, with 50-stage fracs appears to be the optimum. As we said though, we're going to continue to push that stage count higher if we can and we've just got a successful 60-stage trial in the ground. So we're excited about the possibilities there.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And just \u2013 to follow that up to make sure I understood that clearly. You have some spacing pilots that are tighter than 500 feet, with 50 stages being tested, we just don't have the results yet. Is that correct?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","No. Those are actually lower stage count, but we're monitoring those wells closely to see, can we see breakthrough. So far we haven't, but we need a lot more data before we can be definitive.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. That was helpful. I was just wondering can you update on the Gulf of Mexico production outlook over the next several quarters. Specifically are the valve problems behind you and what's the production recovery arc?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. So if we \u2013 as we mentioned in our remarks, there is two kind of two events that are going to happen, the first thing is on Conger. We'll get that defective valve replaced, and it will come, that well will come back online in the first quarter of 2017.","As we move to Tubular Bells, there is two events that are going on there, well, actually three. First of all, we're going to commence water injection this quarter. Secondly, we have a fifth producer that will come online in the first quarter of 2017 and then finally, we'll get that third defective valve replaced in the fourth quarter and the well will come online in the first quarter. And so, that's how it kind of lays out on Conger and the T-Bells. The rest are pretty much just in run-and-maintain mode, run for cash.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And if I could ask a last one real quick. I just wondered if you could add a little bit of color on Skipjack. Just was it simply a non-commercial well or did it fail to find any kind of hydrocarbons (58:07) in the system there? And just how the Skipjack result has an effect, if any, on any other potential exploration targets in the area?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Okay. So, I think, as the operator said, the Skipjack well didn't find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, but did find the same excellent quality reservoir that was seen in the Liza well. So, how we think about this in the context of the whole block is, again, this is a giant block, it's 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. We're in the very early stages of the exploration program and we continue to see numerous additional prospects and play types on the block. And we haven't even processed all the seismic yet. So, we still remain very excited about the potential of the block and try to get that (58:56).","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Well, that was helpful. Thanks very much for answering my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is now open.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale","Yeah. Thanks. Most things have been asked. In the third quarter, you had a $16 million dry hole cost, was that all Skipjack?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yes. It was, John.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale","Okay. Thanks, John. Regarding Payara or however you want to pronounce, your next exploration well in Guyana, is it a similar structure, Greg, morphologically or is there anything you can talk about for that?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","No, very similar stratigraphic trap and same kind of reservoir sequence as the other Liza wells.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. No one's asked yet about the MLP. The last time you updated the S-1 was, I believe, last December, but you're obviously talking about accelerating Bakken activity next year. As that materializes, will you also kind of accelerate perhaps the process towards taking the MLP public?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Right. So just as \u2013 at a high level, the Midstream business itself, it's executing well as you can see from our numbers, the Hawkeye project will kind of \u2013 we're working to completion and that will come online in 2017. Market conditions obviously are getting better. And as you mentioned and John has mentioned earlier that we are making our initial preparations on increasing our drilling activity in the Bakken. And I think when you put all those together and we start increasing our drilling there in the Bakken, it does fit nicely into a timeline then for the MLP IPO.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just kind of conceptually, if and when Hess Midstream ends up becoming a public company, will you limit it to Bakken assets exclusively? Or would you consider adding or broadening its asset base towards other aspects of your domestic Midstream portfolio outside the Bakken?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yes. I mean, we'll obviously talk about this as it gets further in the process. But there is no restriction for the Midstream to just be in our North Dakota business.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, Arun Jayaram, JPM. Just a couple real quick ones. Assuming the upper end of the resource range at Liza, guys, how many phases would that potentially include? You talked about potentially sanctioning Phase I in 2017, but how many potential phases could that include?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","I would direct those questions to ExxonMobil, the operator.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough, fair enough. And my only other question, Malay comes online in the third quarter. Could you give us a sense of how the ramp could like in terms of getting to a full production there?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, so I think again it will reach plateau at 165 million cubic feet a day and the fact that we're pre-drilling most of the producers, that should be a pretty steady ramp.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And what quarter would you anticipate, I guess, getting to full production, is it fourth quarter, first quarter of 2018?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","We'll begin ramping in the third quarter, so probably fourth quarter.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fourth quarter, okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber of Simmons. Your line is now open.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for fitting me in here, at the end of the call. The E&P CapEx has been consistently coming in below guidance, pretty much every quarter. Can you guys just discuss the drivers there? To what extent is that activity-driven, perhaps offshore versus efficiency capture, deflation capture, just curious what you're seeing with those savings. And then I had one follow-up.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Sure, Guy, day in and day out, right now, we are focused on reducing costs, both on an operating basis as well as capital. So the biggest driver of the reduction in capital because we'd already had the activity reductions basically budgeted in or especially when we updated the forecast guidance, so it really has been efficiencies here and just continuing to look at better ways of doing things and reducing costs from that standpoint.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay, great. And then the international offshore CapEx, it looks like you've basically cut off spending to a good portion of your base international offshore assets. Is that something you are comfortable continuing to do through 2017 or do those base assets need to attract a bit more capital and is there anything new to share at Valhall, South Arne, for example?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Right. So, as we talked about, we, across our portfolio, have very good return opportunities, both onshore and offshore. But the way we are thinking about allocating capital here as the prices come back and we've mentioned it is we are now initially preparing for increasing capital to the Bakken. So, that's going to have our first call on capital will be going to the Bakken. Then again now as prices continue to move and as you know, $1 move for us is $70 million of annual cash flow, we'll begin to look across the portfolio and there are opportunities across our offshore portfolio that we could increase capital to. So, it will be something that we'll be looking at and balancing it with where our balance sheet is and commodity prices are and returns to shareholders, but there's very good returns across our portfolio.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","And I think the only thing I'd add there is, there were logical drilling breaks both in EG and South Arne associated with processing additional 4D seismic and ocean bottom seismic. So, those were logical, technical drilling breaks and we're in the process of evaluating all that data.","Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Sorry for lining up again, but I wanted to dig into the fourth quarter production guidance because when I was asking my question, the slides were not yet posted. Can you just walk us through what is driving the drop sequentially, oil versus gas, planned versus unplanned versus declines because the Bakken seems to be relatively stable and I appreciate that? Thanks.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. So if you're starting with our third quarter, the 314,000 barrels per day, we're going to get an increase, about 11,000 barrels a day combined from JDA and South Arne. As Greg had mentioned in his comments earlier, JDA will get back above 30,000 barrels a day because the booster compression tie-in work that we had in the second quarter and South Arne did have a turnaround as well. So we're getting a pickup there.","That increase though is being offset and slightly even more, there is going to be a reduction of about 12,000 barrels a day, as it relates to, as we talked about Utica. Utica is going to be start declining, we're not bringing, we're not drilling and bringing any wells online there. The Bakken, as you mentioned, is still going to \u2013 it's going to come off the 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the decline with the two rigs. And in EG, we do have a bit of our normal entitlement change that we have in the fourth quarter as you get through the year of your cost recovery. So combined Utica, EG and Bakken will be down about 12,000 barrels a day.","Then you have the 1s and 2s, across the portfolio again, where we're not drilling and that comes to approximately 8,000 barrels a day there, just things in the Gulf of Mexico, as Greg mentioned. So that's where we get to this approximate of about 305,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So John, just to be clear, the Utica is obviously mainly gas. So what is the Utica contribution for that \u2013 that makes difference in your cash margins obviously?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","About \u2013 I'd say about 5,000 barrels a day will be in the Utica to \u2013 it will start declining here significantly with no activity happening in the Utica.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Helpful. Thanks, guys.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Sure.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions today.

Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will provide an update on the steps we are taking to manage in the low oil price environment and review some of the highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and John Rielly will review our financial results.","Our strategy in this lower for longer price environment is guided by three principles: preserve our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our growth options. To preserve our balance sheet, on February 4, we successfully executed a capital raise of $1.6 billion through common and mandatory convertible preferred stock offerings. These proceeds will keep our strong balance sheet strong in the low oil price environment and provide the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our growth projects, North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and exploration offshore Guyana.","Further to preserving the strength of our balance sheet, in January, we announced our 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, 40% below 2015 levels. Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production in the current oil price environment makes sense. Rather, we have reduced activity levels across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Our Bakken rig count will be reduced from three rigs currently to two rigs during the third quarter and is expected to remain at this level until the WTI price is closer to $60 per barrel. In the Utica, our one drilling rig was released in March and no further drilling is planned this year. Offshore, we continued the drilling break in Norway and Equatorial Guinea and the rig at South Arne in Denmark is set to be released in the second quarter.","In terms of our operating capabilities, we are delivering industry-leading performance as confirmed by third-party benchmarks, both in unconventionals and offshore drilling and development. Our resilient portfolio is linked to our top quartile operating capabilities and is balanced between unconventionals and offshore providing an attractive mix of short cycle and long cycle investment opportunities. This balanced portfolio also casts a wider net for future long-term growth options.","Our portfolio is leveraged to oil and liquids, with industry-leading cash margins and advantaged tax positions in the U.S. and Norway that will accelerate cash flow growth as oil prices improve. In terms of our growth opportunities, we have leading positions in the Bakken and Utica shale plays; new field startups in North Malay Basin and Stampede, which combined are expected to add 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of new production over the next two years and by 2018 will become material cash generators; and recent exploration success in Guyana that has the potential to provide significant long-term value creation and growth.","Turning to our financial results, in the first quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $509 million, or $1.72 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.98 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher exploration expense which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash costs and DD&A.","While low crude oil prices significantly impacted our first quarter financial results, we delivered strong operational performance. Net production was at the high end of our guidance range, averaging 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to net production of 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter, pro forma for last year's sale of our assets in Algeria. Net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2016, above our guidance range. Our Bakken team reduced drilling and completion costs 25% from the year ago quarter to an average of $5.1 million per well.","In summary, with our strong balance sheet, oil leveraged portfolio and attractive growth opportunities, we believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong cash flow growth and long term value as oil prices recover.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy.","Starting with production, in the first quarter, we averaged 350,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the top end of our guidance range of 340,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and, once again, reflecting strong operating performance across our portfolio. In the second quarter, we expect net production to average between 320,000 barrels and 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance down time at Valhall and several of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. As usual, we will provide an update to our full year production guidance on our mid-year call in July.","Turning to operations, and beginning with the Bakken, our Lean Manufacturing approach has once again enabled us to deliver outstanding performance from one of the best core of the core positions in the play where we retain a substantial drilling inventory with attractive economics even at current prices. Despite reducing our Bakken rig count to an average of four rigs in the first quarter 2016 from 12 rigs in the year-ago quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter compared to 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter.","During the first quarter, we drilled 19 wells and brought 31 new wells online. This compares to the year-ago quarter when we drilled 60 wells and brought 70 wells online. We currently plan to maintain a three rig program through the second quarter, to release one rig during the third quarter and then operate two rigs for the remainder of the year. In 2016, we now expect to drill 62 wells and bring 87 new wells online. This compares to last year when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online.","In the first quarter, our average drilling and completion cost was $5.1 million per well. We expect to be able to maintain this cost level over 2016 even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new standard 50-stage completion design. This higher stage count is expected to deliver a 15% to 20% increase in initial production rates, and with our rigs focused in the core of the play, we expect our estimated ultimate recovery per well to move toward 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day \u2013 oil equivalent in the latter part of 2016.","We also continued to successfully execute our 17-well per DSU spacing pilots and still see the majority of the wells performing in line with type curves and with minimal interference. The combination of both higher overall type curve performance and higher density well spacing has allowed us to increase our estimated ultimate recovery from the Bakken from our previous estimate of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. For the second quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 100,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Moving to the Utica, in the first quarter, the joint venture drilled six wells and brought nine wells on production. Net production for the first quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica acreage is largely held by production, which allows us to reduce activity in the short term while preserving optionality and longer-term upside. While we benefit from our acreage being in the core of the play and a low 5% royalty, we released the one rig we had operating in the play in early March.","As a result of applying our distinctive Lean Manufacturing approach, over the past several years, we have been able to reduce our drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion cost per stage by approximately 50% while at the same time drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. We plan to run the asset for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices and further third-party infrastructure build-out which will reduce the currently wide basin differentials.","Now, turning to the offshore, at the Tubular Bells field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. During the quarter, we conducted the remediation work highlighted in our fourth quarter call, completing asset jobs at two wells. We are now moving the rig to replace a defective sub-surface valve that failed to open. This is the second failure of this type in the field, and we are working with the supplier to understand the root causes of the manufacturing defect.","In the second quarter, we have an extended shutdown scheduled to tie back Noble's Gunflint field to the Williams owned host facility and we plan to spud a fifth producing well in the field. In early April, we also completed our first water injection well and we expect to commence injection in the third quarter.","In Norway, at the BP operated Valhall field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. The operator plans to commence an extended shutdown in the second quarter due to required maintenance work at the ConocoPhillips operated Ekofisk field.","At the South Arne field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, we have completed the current phase of development drilling and do not plan to drill any additional wells in 2016. Net production averaged 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter. At the Malaysia\/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess has a 50% interest, work continues on the Booster Compression project which remains on schedule for completion in the third quarter. Net production averaged 230 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter.","Moving to developments, at North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, progress continues on full field development, 6 out of 11 development wells have now been drilled and drilling results to-date are better than expected. Net production from the early production system averaged 30 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter. Following completion of full field development in 2017, net production is planned to increase to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day.","At the Stampede development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully floated the top-side's main deck onto the production deck, set the whole structure into the offshore floating dock and installed the oil export line. Drilling operations are underway on the first production well and first oil remains on schedule for 2018.","Moving to exploration, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Chevron operated Sicily-2 well in which Hess holds a 25% working interest, reached its target depth and results are currently being evaluated. Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the ConocoPhillips operated Melmar well in which Hess has a 35% working interest reached target depth in early April and logging operations are now complete. The well results are still being evaluated, but as non-commercial quantities of oil were encountered at the current location, the well was expensed in the quarter.","In Guyana, in the Stabroek Block in which Hess holds a 30% interest, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, spud the Liza-2 well in February. This well is designed to further evaluate the significant Liza oil discovery and will include an extended drill stem test. We expect the operator to complete operations on the Liza-2 well late in the second quarter. Following the Liza-2 well, the operator intends to move the rig to test a separate prospect located approximately 25 miles northwest of Liza. We remain excited about the opportunity set on this block, which we believe could be material to our company.","In closing, we have maintained excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. We believe that our focus on preserving the strength of our balance sheet while also preserving our top quartile capabilities and growth options is the right strategy.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, we reported a net loss of $509 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $396 million in the previous quarter. That excludes a net charge of $1.425 billion.","Turning to Exploration and Production, E&P incurred a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to an adjusted net loss of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. That excludes net charges totaling $1.385 billion. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 were as follows. Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $187 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $4 million. Lower cash operating costs improved results by $28 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $71 million. Higher exploration expenses reduced results by $18 million. All other items net to a decrease in results of $13 million for an overall increase in the first quarter net loss of $123 million.","In the first quarter, our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 500,000 barrels which did not have a material impact on first quarter results. The E&P effective income tax rate was a benefit of 41% for the first quarter of 2016 compared with the benefit of 38% in the fourth quarter, excluding items affecting comparability.","Turning to Midstream, first quarter net income of $14 million increased from $11 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to lower operating costs. Bakken Midstream EBITDA excluding the non-controlling interest amounted to $70 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $67 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to corporate and interest, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $72 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 which excludes net charges totaling $32 million. The reduction resulted from lower professional fees and general and administrative costs.","Turning to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $148 million. A net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $208 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $620 million. Net debt repayments were $12 million. Net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock were $1.644 billion. Common stock dividends paid were $80 million. Other net amounted to a use of cash of $31 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $841 million.","Turning to our financial position, we had approximately $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2016 and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $8.3 billion. Excluding Bakken Midstream, total debt was $5.9 billion at March 31, 2016 and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 23.1%.","Now, turning to second quarter guidance; for E&P, we project cash costs for E&P operations to be in the range of $16.50 to $17.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, reflecting lower production and higher maintenance costs from the planned offshore facility shutdowns. DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent is forecast to be $26.50 per barrel to $27.50 per barrel, resulting in projected total E&P unit operating costs of $43 per barrel to $45 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016.","The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected $3.75 to $3.85 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter of 2016, while exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million. The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the second quarter. For Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the second quarter.","For corporate and interest, we expect corporate expenses net of taxes to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the second quarter of 2016.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",". Your first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Two operational questions, if I may. The first one, obviously, the move to 50-stage fracs and the raise to EURs, obviously, you gave good guidance in the supplementals about IPs and obviously we can see some of the state data, but when do you think the completions at the 50-stage frac will actually start to show up in the data? I appreciate there is some time lags, maybe some color about that? And then I have a follow-on about Guyana.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Okay. Thanks, Ed. If you look at the majority of the wells that we brought on in the first quarter of this year, the majority were 35-stage fracs, so we'll move into that 50-stage frac as we move through the year. And recall, we expect a 15% to 20% uplift from those 50-stage completions. So if you look at IP rates, Q1, it was just under 800 boe\/d, we expect that to move towards 1,000 boe\/d as we move into the second half of the year. So we really see the benefit of those kicking in in the second half of the year as we complete those new wells.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then a follow-on just on Guyana, I appreciate the seismic, I guess, is now complete, some processing. Maybe any update in terms of perhaps not the well you're drilling today, but the confidence integral from the data that you've seen on, I guess, the other channels as you move further to the northwest of Liza-1?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Ed. I think as Exxon has said, and we've said, we see a fair amount of press activity on the block and that continues to be confirmed with the 3D seismic that we are processing. Again, we just got to drill more wells. We plan to drill one or two additional exploration wells this year and that will give us some additional color on prospectivity, but looks good on seismic.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. You may begin.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can I start with a couple of housekeeping points, I guess, just on the numbers for the quarter? The differentials internationally looked a little wide, and I'm wondering if there's anything \u2013 any nuance there? And I guess a similar thing with the oil mix in the Bakken. So I've got a follow-up on exploration, please.","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay, Doug, I'll start with the differentials. There was something unusual just from \u2013 in the first quarter and it had to do just with our timing of lifts. So there's two aspects of why our differentials widened. So with the timing, actually we produce about approximately 75,000 barrels a day of oil internationally, but our liftings were heavily in January and February. We actually lifted about 89,000 barrels a day in January, and 130,000 barrels a day in February, and March liftings were only 19,000 barrels a day. So obviously we lifted more just timing-wise when oil prices were lower in the quarter, and so that had an impact on our differentials.","The other thing that did a true weakening was on the West African crudes, not just ours but, in general, West African crudes where kind of the differential widened about $1, and that did happen with our EG liftings as well in the quarter.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And on the oil mix in the Bakken, it looked like it swung a little bit toward NGLs, John.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Doug. That was \u2013 this is Greg -- that was primarily just a weather-related operational issue in January. It had to do with complying with Reid vapor pressure requirements in the field. That caused it to shut in some oil production. So if you look at kind of oil in January, it was actually down around 69,000 barrels a day, but that completely reversed itself in February\/March, and it was at 75,000 barrels a day for the months of February and March. So that came back up. So it was just a temporary transient issue in January.","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And then, Doug, the only other thing I'll add to that with the wells is we are \u2013 and it is our focus this year with our Midstream infrastructure, we are out gathering more gas. So from the wells, as Greg said, the wells were impacted by the vapor pressure and we will be adding additional gas into our gas plant and therefore NGLs throughout the year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But the \u2013 just to be clear, the oil should come back or did come back, Greg, towards the end of the quarter?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","It did.","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","As Greg said, it did, and so it's 69,000 barrels a day, 75,000 barrels a day, 75,000 barrels a day. So that 5,000 barrel a day increase was \u2013 decrease was just impacted by those vapor pressure issues in January.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Just to be clear from our wells themselves, there's no change in the oil\/gas mix. It's steady as she goes.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's what I was getting at. Thanks, John. My follow-up, fellows, is \u2013 I'm not going to ask about Guyana, but I would like to ask about Melmar and Sicily. Has Melmar now been condemned by this well? And on Sicily are you really just holding out waiting on the operator commenting or is there some nuance in your commentary that you're still evaluating the results? I mean, could Sicily end up being a field appraisal as well, I guess is what I'm getting at?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, Doug, on both wells it's really too early to comment. They're both under evaluation. As we said in the script, Melmar at the current location didn't have economic quantities of oil. But that doesn't mean that the block is done, right? So we're under evaluation of all the data that came out of the well right now.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And on Sicily, Greg?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Same thing, Doug. Under evaluation with the operator.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, guys.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","First question on the Bakken. I believe you said to think about ramping up there, you would want to wait until you saw $60 a barrel at WTI, and I wondered if you could add some color on why $60 a barrel versus lower or higher price? How much of that decision is driven by your view of what the break-even oil price is at the well level to meet your return thresholds versus your corporate needs to improve your balance sheet versus the competition for capital elsewhere such as potential Guyana development?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So all those factors play into that decision, and you did round it off pretty well. So let's just start with returns. We have an excellent acreage position in the Bakken. And as you know, we've got good returns that we could drill wells here at $40 a barrel and we could drill at $50 a barrel and get good return wells. But obviously at $60 a barrel the returns are going to be better. And more of our acreage then meets our return threshold as you move towards $60 a barrel. So obviously we want to improve returns for our shareholders.","The next aspect of it is we are spending money on growth right now. You know North Malay Basin and Stampede, so we will have 35,000 barrels a day coming in 2018 from those two projects. And like you said, we've already added some valuable resources here in Guyana. And we're going to continue exploration there and see if we can add more valuable resources there.","Then it comes to the last part of your point was we do look at overall corporate cash flow. And we want to deliver growth with free cash flow. And at $60 a barrel, Bakken, we can add rigs and Bakken will grow and generate free cash flow. So that is something that we're looking to do from the portfolio aspect. And then with our balance sheet, with this low point in the cycle, we want to come out of that low point in the cycle with this strong balance sheet. So our plan is because our portfolio is so levered to oil, $1.00 for us gives us $75 million of annual cash flow. So we want to bank that cash flow as you move up to $60 a barrel again to improve the balance sheet. So all those factors play a role.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. And then shifting to the international assets, there were a couple of comments that you made that I wanted to see if you could add some additional color. The first was in North Malay Basin where I believe you said of the development wells was drilled, they were coming in better than expected. How that may impact, if at all, the total production which I think you seem to say was not changed and any kind of returns or well costs. And then in Guyana I believe you mentioned that there was an extended drill stem test being drilled, if it's at all possible to add any color around what precipitated that?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Thanks for the question. On North Malay Basin, the wells are coming in with thicker pay overall. Now, that will likely not affect the initial volumes coming out of North Malay Basin. It could have a positive reserve effect, but we're \u2013 all that's under evaluation right now, so it's too early to say one way or the other. Regarding Guyana, again, the operations that we're conducting in Guyana with the operator ExxonMobil, two major objectives; one is appraise the Liza discovery. So that will be additional wells to find the edges of the reservoir, let's call it. Also an extended drill stem test as well. That's key dynamic data that we will need in terms of designing a development of Liza. The second objective is to drill those one or two exploration wells that I talked about, which are going after some Liza lookalikes on the block.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. You may begin.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just an immediate...","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","...follow-up. You mentioned Guyana was \u2013 I think you said potentially material or maybe just material to Hess. When is the best hope for actual first production?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, I think again, Paul, I think we've got to get these appraisal wells down. So it's too early to say when an early production system might come on. So let us get through the appraisal, which will be in the third quarter and then we can hopefully give some more color after that.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood. And I guess given that you said it's material, we can hope to see press releases as to what's going on there from here.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we would hope after the appraisal drilling and drill stem tests, the operator will be in a position to provide more color on resource estimate or range of resource estimate.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thanks, John. Just the outlook for CapEx for the year, you came in low relative to our expectations for Q1. I think the Q2 numbers may be a little bit higher than we thought. Can you talk a little bit about the sensitivities of the CapEx outlook to the oil price? And I'd heard, and I have to say this is second hand that you talked about $60 a barrel being the point at which you would resume growth, I think, in the Bakken. Was that an accurate second hand story that I got? Or am I thinking of the wrong price? Thanks.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. On the $60 a barrel, I can answer that because it was in my remarks. Our first priority is the balance sheet. So to be clear, first and foremost we just want to strengthen the cash flow generation of the company and the balance sheet to fund our growth projects and also come out of this low price environment on our front feet. The second is, we have plenty of locations that John talked about, we have in our investor pack, where we generate in excess of a 15% after-tax return at $50 a barrel probably over 600 locations and $60 a barrel over 1,000 locations. So our locations compete not only with the best acreage in the Bakken, but the best acreage of any shale play in the United States including the Permian. So our focus, even though we have those locations, is on value not volume. And we're going to be guided by capital discipline and financial returns and that's why we've said that $60 a barrel is our price that we will focus on where we start ramping up Bakken activity.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","And I guess what you're saying there, John, is in the interim between $50 a barrel and $60 a barrel it would be a balance sheet prioritization strategy. And then could you guys just follow on with the CapEx sensitivity for the year? Thanks.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct.","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So as usual, we will update middle of the year. You're right; our capital was running a bit lower than the run rate in the first quarter. Obviously we are focused on being tight on spending on capital, on operating. So we're looking at all possibilities to reduce. But I don't want to get ahead of it. We'll get through the second quarter. We'll get through the shutdowns that Greg mentioned, and we'll update capital middle of the year.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could follow up with one on the Bakken, and then shift somewhere else. On the Bakken, can you provide any color on the expected trajectory of, you mentioned you're going from four rigs, or you went from three rigs and then to two rigs in the third quarter. Any shift? I think earlier the view was to go from four to two by late February. Was there a shift in the plan of rigs? Is there a reason in terms of any thoughts behind the shift there? And then should we expect the completion to be effectively ratable over the remainder of this year?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So the reason in going from three rigs, extending that third rig just a little bit longer. That was purely just an efficient way to ramp down the Bakken, it really completes some existing pads. While the rig is there, you just soon complete those pads rather than get them partially done and then come back later. So that was purely an efficiency thing as we lined out the work for the year. If you look at the Bakken production character, what we've said is that our range for the year is 105,000 boe\/d to 95,000 boe\/d. And certainly directionally that mimics what is going to happen to the production curve. So it's going to start out high and then end the year probably close to the end of that, or the bottom end of that range. That will give you a sense for how Bakken production is going to look over the year. Obviously, we're starting a little bit higher. But you can assume about a 10% decline over the year in the Bakken.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Very helpful. And then maybe one more. Obviously, very, very strong results on the EUR uplift from the Bakken. The million barrel EUR number that you were talking about, how much of your 3,200 well inventory should we assume that's applicable to? Is that a small \u2013 is that a portion of it? Is that all of it? And is it a ratable EUR increase across \u2013 or an equal EUR percentage increase across all of your inventory?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","No. It's not ratable. So it's again, this is a result of drilling in the core of the core. So we're really drilling in the best part of the Bakken right now. I don't have the exact numbers, but it's a couple hundred wells that are probably in this thousand EUR. We did not increased EUR for the 50-stage fracs yet. There may be an EUR increase in the wells associated with that, but we wanted to get more production history under our belt before we increase the EUR associated with 50-stage fracs.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Greg. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning, guys.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Let me follow up on the Bakken to Ryan's [audio skip] (38:57). What were your thoughts on to increasing the full year guidance with increased completions today? I think you're 87 versus 80 in the first quarter and that your ops report just came out with this improved spud to spud time which would potentially give you a tailwind there. Any thoughts there?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, I think, Evan, as we always do, we'll update all of our guidance on the July call after our second quarter. We'll be updating production capital, all of our guidance. Now what I will say from a company standpoint, we do have some extended shutdowns in this quarter that were longer than we had in our original planning assumptions, both associated with third-party shutdowns. So how all that kind of offsets higher production to Bakken, that's what we'll guide the market on in our July call.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Fair enough. And to follow up also on Guyana, I mean, should we expect a resource estimate this summer specifically for Liza? Or potentially a broader delineation of the potential or other prospects on the block? And is that \u2013 is a resource estimate something that's in conjunction with additional pre-feed work being done? Or how does that relate to the timing on ultimate development?","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Fair question, Evan, and we're going to leave that to the operator, but it's obviously subject to the appraisal drilling and well tests that we're going to do. And then out of that we would hope we could get some granularity on what the resource estimate on Liza might be, and I wouldn't want to get ahead of ourselves beyond that.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, maybe I'll ask someone Friday as well, but if I could squeeze in one last one, in the ops report, any color on the 30 day IPs? Kind of the relative performance from the 50-stage completions year-over-year down \u2013 did I miss that explanation earlier? Any color there would be helpful.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So Evan, if you look at our first quarter, the IPs were just under 800 barrels a day. That also had some down time. Remember I talked about the down time in January, so that pulled the IP rates down a bit. We guided 800 barrels a day to 950 barrels a day for the year, so basically, the IPs will increase from here and will move towards 1,000 barrels a day in the latter half of the year. So this first quarter got pulled down by some operational issues, but also we were putting on wells online that were more like 35-stage fracs, carryover from last year. As we move into the year that'll move towards 1,000 barrels a day.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. You may begin.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Couple quick \u2013 several quick questions. First one with John Rielly. John, you gave a guidance for the second quarter unit DD&A and the cash costs. Based on that and first quarter results, it looked like the full year DD&A, the previous guidance, $28.5 per barrel to $29.5 per barrel, seems way high. Is there any reason that we should not assume the second half of the year your unit DD&A will be somewhat similar to the first half? And in terms of the cash costs on the other hand, it seems like your previous full year guidance say $14.5 per barrel to $15.5 per barrel, if we assume the second quarter in $17.5 per barrel or so, $16.5 per barrel to $17.5 per barrel, should we assume there is more to it into the high end of the range?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Paul. Let's go through. I'll start with the cash costs. So the first thing in \u2013 our cash costs in the first quarter were down to $14.62 so there was over a 5% decline from Q4. And again, like we said, we're very focused on where we're spending money on operating costs as well as capital. And some of the operating costs in the first quarter, as Greg had mentioned, we did have higher workovers as well. So we've been pretty good at being able to reduce the costs.","Now on the flip side, Greg just mentioned that we had some extended shutdowns that were not part of our original plan. So that is, from that second quarter guidance, is driving up so we have lower production and additional maintenance costs coming in the second quarter is driving up our second quarter costs. What we'd like to do kind of like with all our guidance, we'd like to get through that. Then we'll have six months of data, we'll come in July and we'll give the update for the cash costs at that point and we'll see where we're moving for the rest of the year.","DD&A is a mix issue. So again, basically offshore had to do again what Greg was talking about from fields that we had a mixed force. (44:07) Some fields were producing more at a lower DD&A rate and some of the fields that were producing less at a higher DD&A rate. So it was purely a mix issue. So, again, I'd like to get through these shutdowns, get through the six months of data before I do update the numbers.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, just curious that is the turnaround downtime primary focus in the second quarter? Or it's going to have equal amount (44:30) in the third quarter? Or the third quarter will be significantly lower?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. No, the majority, Paul, is going to be in the second quarter. That's at T Bells and Conger in the Gulf of Mexico, and in Valhall in the North Sea. There's a smaller amount in the third quarter, and that will be at JDA and South Arne.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","That's how the shutdowns kind of break out throughout the year.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And as you move to 50 stage, do you intended to keep the well cost to be flat on the ground level? How about the cash operating cost? Is that going to trick (45:07) a higher cash operating cost? Or you will be able to more than offset it with the efficiency gain?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, I think we'll be more than able to offset that with the efficiency gain as well.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And Greg, just curious that in the first quarter if I looking at it sequentially, the U.S. oil price realization dropped $10, $11. Benchmark seems to be dropping $8 to $9. Is there any mix issue that we should be realized that that's causing that and then it will get reverse in the second or third quarter? Or that this is really going to be a new defense (45:47) of looking \u2013 this is a good base now going forward?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So you are correct. The onshore differential has really widened between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So it's driven obviously up in the Bakken with our production. Clearbrook was approximately $1 under WTI in the fourth quarter and it moved to $1.80 under TI (sic) [WTI] (46:11) in the first quarter. So that $0.80 was driving some of our differential. The overall differential though moved about $1.55 in our production, and that is because the rail market was weaker in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, again due to the narrowing of the Brent TI (sic) [WTI] (46:29) spread.","Clearbrook has been getting a little better in April and May, not a big change. But it's been a little better that we are seeing on the sales volume, so that could come back. And then the rail market, that will move and we'll try to optimize between [audio disruption] (46:44) pipe depending on where the best economics are.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just a little more color. You know, in the last year our oil (46:52) have gone from 50\/50 pipeline\/train to 70%, 30% pipeline\/train. And we're maxing out our pipeline deliveries as we speak to make sure we get the most for our oil that we sell.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Final question if I could. Greg, if you're looking at your current manpower and organization capability, if you are not adding any head count, what is the maximum number of rig that you can handle? And how quickly that you can ramp it to that level if you want to?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Paul. Good question. I mean, as John mentioned, our second priority is to preserve the capability. So what we have done -- one of the reasons that we didn't cut the Bakken rigs to zero was we wanted to leave a couple rigs so that we could maintain the capability and ability to ramp up. As we look at it, we think with the manpower that we have, because we have gone down substantially in manpower, but we think because of the manpower that we do have, we think that we can efficiently ramp up from two to six rigs over a 9- to 12-month period. So we can go from two to six rigs relatively painlessly without losing a lot of the efficiencies that we've worked so hard to maintain with the Lean Manufacturing capabilities. So...","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. You may begin.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Regarding the two Bakken rigs in 2016, my memory was that the company once said that four rigs were required to maintain efficiencies and skilled labor. I was just wondering: has this efficiency just proved too expensive to afford? Or have you taken efficiency to new levels that allow for core competency preservation with two rigs?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sorry, my mic was off. It's more of the latter. So we've taken our efficiency to new levels, and we believe that we can preserve enough capability with two rigs versus the four to be able to efficiently ramp up when prices approach the $60 a barrel that John has mentioned.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. We're hearing a lot about cost reduction efforts from other offshore operators. I was just wondering if you have any line of sight for cost reductions that could support a resumption of drilling in places like Equatorial Guinea, South Arne and Ghana at lower oil prices that might have been the case earlier in the downturn.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So I think, again, if you think about when we would restart drilling, as John Reilly mentioned in his comments, it's really going to be a function of corporate cash flow. So we're really going to be watching corporate cash flow before we restart drilling either offshore or onshore in the Bakken. So that's going to be the primary driver. But broadly, the pace of the cost reductions has been slower offshore than onshore due to the need to work off the backlog of those higher cost rig contracts and also the work in the yards associated with previously-sanctioned projects.","So now rigs, boats and associated equipment are already starting to come down substantially. And we know that because we're seeing a lot of those benefits in Guinea, for example, on the rig rates and the seismic boat rates. And then we expect that to continue as offshore projects are completed, so we think further rate cost capitulation will occur. And then importantly the yard rates will start to come down as well as capacity becomes available. And in fact in some of our pre-feed work that we're doing around the globe we're already seeing significantly lower indicative bids in the offshore yard and rig space, so more to come in the offshore. But again, restart, I think, is going to be back to what John Rielly said: it's going to be a function of corporate cash flow.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. You may begin.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. Very similar to the previous one with a small tweak; for Ghana, what Brent price would you need to see to sanction a full scale development? So above and beyond corporate cash flows?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, I think first of all, Ghana is right now is a sanction because of the border dispute. So we're working with the government to try and get the deadlines extended there. So until the border dispute is clear, which the earliest would be mid-2017, we wouldn't be in a position to say what sanction price Ghana would need because it would depend upon the cost curve at that point in time. We do see cost coming down. So way too early to speculate what price it would take.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then same question about the Utica; what Henry Hub threshold do you have in mind to put at least one rig back to work in the Utica?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So it's not just the \u2013 obviously, it's the low commodity prices. And as Greg mentioned earlier, the wide basin differentials that are causing us the issue right now. The rock is very good. We like the asset. So it really is depending on additional infrastructure being built out to get the product out of that basin. So we do see that happening. So as that infrastructure is built out we see \u2013 and the basin differentials narrow along with improving commodity prices is when we'd go back to work in the Utica.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. You may begin.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color around the magnitude of the Q2 downtime at Valhall, Conger and Tubular Bells?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Let me give you directionally how many days of downtime are planned. So again this is all third-party shutdowns. So Valhall expected to be around a 25-day shutdown. That's associated with Ekofisk, so it's coincident with the Ekofisk shutdown. Tubular Bells, about 31 days down, again, that's a third-party tie in of Gunflint to the Williams' owned host facility at Tubular Bells. And then finally there's an anticipated 22-day shutdown in Conger associated with Shell's turnaround of Enchilada\/Salsa during the second quarter. So that gives you an idea of how much.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And these wouldn't have been in your original guide, right? These were outside of that?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, they were. But the way the forecast works is you get an estimate from the operator when you're putting your business plan together, and then the operator updates that as it gets closer to forecast. So what happened is there were more days now as the operators have come forward and given us the final day to \u2013 they've extended those shutdowns longer than we thought, so that's why there's a difference...","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","...in the assumption there.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Just one on the Bakken. Understanding you're capturing more gas, do you have a \u2013 give us a sense of what you think as things normalize, your oil\/gas\/NGL mix could look like, ballpark?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think through 2016, this percentage of oil, at mid-60%s say, is where we see the crude being as it goes through 2016.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Mid-60%s? Okay. Okay. And last question is the G&A expenses were down pretty significantly on a sequential basis. Is that \u2013 do you think you could hold that level of G&A that you saw in the first quarter, $98 million?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So...","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It was down almost $40 million sequentially.","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right. So now some of that, if you're just looking sequentially on the G&A line itself and we do have in the first \u2013 I mean, sorry, in the fourth quarter there were some specials that were there. But we did have a good sequential decline in G&A, like I said. Across the company we're looking at costs all over, operating, G&A. So some of it is timing. We did have lower professional fees in the quarter, but we are trying and looking to reduce the costs. And the corporate guidance that we gave is a bit down now even for the second quarter. So we are beginning to see some savings throughout the company, but I'd like to wait until the mid-year before I update all the rest of the guidance.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Phillip Jungwirth with BMO. You may begin.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning. $60 a barrel is a price required to increase activity in the Bakken would that threshold be similar for some of your conventional offshore development areas such as the North Sea and Africa? Can you provide any color on what you're doing in these areas to maintain operator capabilities?","John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll just first talk about like when we're going to put capital back to work. And again, I just want to remind you we have some great opportunities and great return locations even at these lower prices, but due to corporate cash flow and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet is why we're going to move towards $60 a barrel before we put rigs back to work in the Bakken. The way we are thinking about it with we have our development projects, Stampede and North Malay Basin. That's going to generate 35,000 barrels a day of production, in 2018 we have Guyana. But the next call on our capital will be Bakken, and that's why as we look as we get to $60 a barrel, there's plenty of running room there, we'll start putting more rigs to work.","What it means now on offshore is \u2013 and I think Greg might have mentioned, it's not that we don't have very good return opportunities of tie-backs on our offshore assets, we do. Some is good or even better than the Bakken. The issue that we now have is you have to then commit to a rig. So you'll have to get a rig to location and what it's going to mean is you're going to have to commit to multi-wells or maybe more than one year. So at that point we're going to want even stronger prices than $60 a barrel and feel that it's sustainable before we go commit to that.","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","In terms of preserving capability, the second part of your question, we've done just like we've done in the Bakken, we've moved people over, put them on special projects, special assignments, which really don't want to lose the drilling and completions capabilities, so we think we've adequately covered that in Reid point people's (58:31) other opportunities.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. And on Tubular Bells, what's your expectation for second half production there and is there anything you've experienced to-date that would cause you to believe peak production or EUR is different from initial expectations?","Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer","No. I think, again, as we mentioned in our opening remarks, we've had a failure of a second down hole valve which was unfortunately one of our largest producers and so we've got to move the rig over to do that. It's not a rig-less intervention, it requires the rig. So the second half of the year, Tubular Bells will hopefully be in that 25,000 barrel a day range that we thought it would be at this point, and would be had it not been for the valve failure.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference.

Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will review our strategy and key highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results.","Our company delivered strong performance this quarter and continues to make significant progress in our strategy. First, to grow our resource base in a capital-disciplined manner. Second, to move down the cost curve so that we are resilient in a low oil price environment. And third, to be cash-generative at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price post 2020.","Our strategy reflects our view that shale alone will not be enough to meet the world's oil demand growth and offset base production declines. For the past several years, the industry has significantly underinvested in longer cycle projects, which currently represent approximately 90% to 95% of global oil supply.","We have focused our portfolio on four key areas, offshore Guyana and the Bakken as our growth engines with Malaysia and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico as our cash engines. By investing in our highest return assets, divesting higher-cost mature assets, and implementing a $150 million annual cost reduction program, we expect to lower our cash unit production costs by 30% between 2017 and 2020, while reducing unit DD&A rates by 35% over the same period.","On a pro forma basis, production from our high-graded portfolio is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% between 2017 and 2023, assuming a flat $50 per barrel Brent oil price, operating cash flow is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 20% over the same period.","In 2017, our asset monetizations resulted in proceeds of $3.4 billion. Proceeds are being used to prefund our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana, increased from four rigs to six rigs in the Bakken, returned $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2018 through share repurchases, and reduced debt by $500 million.","Key to our strategy is our position in Guyana, which represents one of the most attractive oil investment opportunities in the world today. The 6.6 million acres Stabroek block in Guyana where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, cost, rapid cash paybacks, and superior financial returns.","In February, we continued our exploration success in Guyana with a seventh oil discovery at the Pacora-1 well. This discovery followed positive results from the Ranger-1 well in January, which demonstrated that the petroleum system is working in a new geologic play more than 60 miles Northwest of the Liza development and reaffirmed the extraordinary exploration potential of the block.","Excluding Ranger and Pacora, estimated gross discovered recoverable resources on the block were increased to more than 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. And we continue to see multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential on the block.","The Liza Phase 1 development, which was sanctioned last June, is progressing well with first production of gross 120,000 barrels of oil per day expected by 2020 less than five years after discovery.","Phase 2 with gross production of 220,000 barrels of oil per day is slated for start-up by mid-2022. The giant Payara field is planned as the third development with start-up expected in late 2023 or early 2024, bringing expected gross production from the first three phases of development to more than 500,000 barrels of oil per day.","Turning to the Bakken, our largest operated asset where we have more than 500,000 net acres in the core of the play. We plan to add a fifth rig in the third quarter and a sixth rig in the fourth quarter of this year. This increased activity is expected to generate capital efficient production growth from a 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017 up to 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 along with a meaningful increase in free cash flow generation over this period.","Turning to our financial results. In the first quarter of 2018, we posted a net loss of $106 million, or $0.38 per share, down from a net loss of $324 million, or $1.07 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to 2017, our first quarter financial results primarily reflect higher realized crude oil selling prices and lower operating costs and DD&A.","First quarter production was above the high-end of our guidance range of 220,000 to 225,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day averaging 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Bakken production averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above our guidance of approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In summary, our focus for 2018 is on execution. And we believe we are off to a very strong start to the year. In the first quarter, we increased cash returns to shareholders, reduced debt, exceeded our production guidance, continued to lower our costs and announced two significant oil discoveries offshore Guyana, Ranger and Pacora.","Longer-term, our reshaped portfolio is positioned to deliver a decade-plus of capital-efficient growth, with increasing cash generation and returns to shareholders.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update of our progress in 2018 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production; in the first quarter production averaged 233,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance range of 220,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day to 225,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily reflecting strong performance in the Bakken. In the second quarter, we expect production to average between 235,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and 245,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.","We maintain our full-year 2018 production guidance of 245,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day to 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Production is expected to grow steadily throughout the year increasing to between 265,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and 275,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, which represents a growth rate of over 15% between the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2018.","In the Bakken, we delivered a strong quarter that continued to build upon the successes of last year. First quarter production averaged 111,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of more than 12% from the year-ago quarter. Our 60-stage, 8.4 million pound proppant completions continue to show a 15% to 20% uplift in both IP180s and EUR over our previous 50-stage's 3.5 million pounds standard. Because we were reaching the practical limits of the sliding sleeve system in terms of stage count. Last year, we began piloting limited entry plug-and-perf completions and initial results are encouraging. This new limited entry technique allows us to more than double the number of distinct entry points in a 10,000-foot lateral, while maintaining good fracture geometry control and should result in a further increase in initial production rates, estimated ultimately recovery, and most importantly net present value.","Well, we only have a small number of wells that have been on production for 90 days or more. We are increasing the number of plug-and-perf completions and plan to complete approximately 40 and bring online 25 of these wells in 2018. We will keep you apprised of results as we go throughout the year. We're also conducting a comprehensive study of the Bakken to determine optimum development methodology for each area of the basin.","As previously announced, we plan to add a fifth rig during the third quarter and a sixth rig during the fourth quarter. We also plan to add a third frac crew by the end of the year. In the first quarter, we drilled 23 wells and brought 13 wells online. For the full year 2018, we expect to drill approximately 120 wells and bring 95 wells online. In the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken production will average approximately 115,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and for the full-year 2018, we forecast production to average between 115,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and 120,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Longer-term, we continue to forecast steady Bakken production growth to approximately 175,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021, assuming six rig.","Moving to the offshore. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production averaged 41,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, reflecting the previously announced downtime at the Shell-operated Enchilada Platform following the fire there in early November 2017.","During the first quarter, production was restored at our Baldpate and Penn State fields as well as at the Shell-operated Llano field. Approximately 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day of production remain shut-in at our Conger field, but we expect Conger to resume production by the end of the third quarter. At our Stampede field where Hess is operator and has a 25% interest, we achieve first oil from the field in January. We will continue to ramp-up production gradually throughout 2018 and expect to achieve peak rates during 2019. Drilling will continue throughout this period.","For the second quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average between 45,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and 50,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and maintain our 2018 full-year production forecast of approximately 50,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. By the fourth quarter with all Enchilada-impacted fields back online and the continued ramp-up at Stampede, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 65,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Moving to the Gulf of Thailand, at the joint development area, in which Hess has a 50% interest, production averaged 34,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. Production is forecast to average approximately 36,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018. At the North Malay Basin, also in the Gulf of Thailand, production averaged 22,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter and is forecast to average approximately 26,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018.","Now, turning to Guyana. At the Stabroek block, in which Hess holds a 30% interest, we announced a seventh oil discovery at Pacora located approximately 4 miles west of Payara. The well encountered approximately 65-feet of high-quality oil barring sandstone reservoir. Following well operations on Pacora, ExxonMobil spud the Liza-5 appraisal well on March 8, the well has been logged and cored and the operator is currently performing a drill stem test, results from the Pacora-1 and Liza-5 wells will be incorporated to appropriately size the FPSO for the third phase of development, which will be between 175,000 barrels of oil per day and 220,000 barrels of oil per day.","Following completion of the well test on Liza-5, the Stena Carron will drill the longtail 1 (15:45) prospect located approximately four miles Northwest of the Turbot-1 discovery. A second drilling rig the Noble Bob Douglas, spud an exploration well on the Sorubim prospect on April 3, which is located approximately 37 miles Southwest of the Ranger discovery. Well operations are still underway. Following Sorubim, the Bob Douglas will begin drilling the first of 17 planned development wells associated with Liza Phase-1. The Liza Phase-1 development sanctioned in June 2017 remains on track for first oil by 2020 with a nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. Liza Phase-2 is on track for sanction by year-end with a nameplate capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and first oil expected by mid-2020. The Liza Phase-3 development is in feed and first oil is expected in late-2023 or early-2024.","In Canada, offshore Nova Scotia, The Aspy well was spud on April 22. BP is operator and has each hold a 50% working interest in exploration licenses that cover approximately 3.5 million acres equivalent to some 600 Deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks. The well is targeting a large subsalt structure, analogues to those found in the Gulf of Mexico.","In closing, our team once again demonstrated excellent execution and delivery across our asset base. The Bakken is on a strong capital-efficient growth trajectory and Guyana continues to get bigger and better.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017. We incurred a net loss of $106 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with a net loss of $2.677 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods was $72 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $304 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to exploration and production. On an adjusted basis, E&P had net income of $12 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with a net loss of $219 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017 were as follows.","Higher realized selling prices improved results by $54 million, lower sales volumes reduced results by $133 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $207 million, lower cash cost improved results by $40 million. Lower exploration expense improved results by $32 million. All other items improved results by $31 million for an overall improvement in first quarter results of $231 million.","Turning to Midstream, the Midstream segment had net income of $28 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Midstream EBITDA before the non-controlling interest and excluding specials amounted to $123 million in the first quarter, compared to $113 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to corporate and interest. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $109 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $105 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. After-tax adjusted corporate and interest expenses were $112 million in the first quarter of 2018. Capitalized interest in the first quarter was lower than the prior quarter by $21 million due to first production at the Stampede field in January.","Turning to our financial position. We increased our share buyback during the quarter to $1.5 billion from $500 million, representing nearly 10% of shares outstanding. This combined with our previously announced plan to retire $500 million in debt allows us to maintain a strong balance sheet, while providing current returns to shareholders. Excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $3.4 billion. Total liquidity was $7.7 billion, including available committed credit facilities; and debt was $5.587 billion.","In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 8 million shares of common stock for $380 million, which completed the initial $500 million program. In April, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter.","During the first quarter, we paid $415 million to retire debt including the redemption of $350 million principal amount of 8.125% notes due in 2019 and to purchase other notes. We remain on target to complete our $1.5 billion stock repurchase program and our $500 million debt reduction initiative in 2018.","Now turning to second quarter guidance; in the first quarter, our E&P cash costs were $13.46 per barrel of oil equivalent, which beat guidance on strong production performance and a deferral of Tubular Bells workover to the second quarter. As a result of the workover deferral, cash costs for the second quarter of 2018 are projected to be $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, with full-year guidance of $13 per barrel to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent remaining unchanged.","DD&A expense in the second quarter is forecast to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.50 per barrel of oil equivalent with the full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs of $32 to $34 per barrel of oil equivalent in the second quarter, with the full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $31 to $33 per barrel of oil equivalent.","Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the second quarter, with full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $190 million to $210 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $165 million for the second quarter and $625 million to $650 million for the full year of 2018, which is unchanged from prior guidance. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 0% to 4% for the second quarter, with the full-year guidance of a benefit in the range of 0% to 4% remaining unchanged.","With respect to our 2018 crude oil hedges, we are now able to realize the benefit of WTI prices above $65, which we accomplished by buying back the $65 WTI call options within our crude oil collars. We continue to keep the $50 WTI put options on 115,000 barrels per day of production for the remainder of the year. We expect amortization of premiums on our crude oil hedges, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices, will reduce our results by approximately $45 million per quarter for the remainder of 2018.","We anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $30 million in the second quarter, with the full-year guidance of $105 million to $115 million remaining unchanged.","Turning to corporate and interest. For the second quarter of 2018, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million. Full-year guidance remains unchanged at $105 million to $115 million for corporate expenses and $345 million to $355 million for interest expenses.","This concludes my remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Guys or maybe Mr. Hess, I wonder if you could opine on the latest thoughts on your disposal plans, and what I have specifically in mind is, obviously oil prices are a little healthier? Now Denmark appears, I believe that process is underway. So, if you could give an update, any expectations on the timing. If I could ask you to also address Libya and the Utica and was in the back of my mind is, obviously, Marathon say with Libya, and any other issues you think may contribute to non-core assets sales this year? I've got a follow-up question.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah, Doug, you know the sale process for our Denmark assets is ongoing. So I can't say more than that right now. And while we obviously can't comment specifically on the Total-Marathon transaction, in the normal course of business, we're always looking to high-grade and optimize our portfolio. So that's what we'd like to say on Libya, and for that matter on the Utica.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If I may, the one that's missing then I guess is, you'd talked previously about potentially dropping down some additional Midstream assets to the joint venture with specifically Bakken water handling, is that still the plan for 2018?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yes, that's still the plan, Doug, that we do plan to have that done in 2018.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you give an order of magnitude as to what the EBITDA associated with that is, John?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","No, not at this point. So, we are still putting together the assets that will be dropped and will be working with our partner GIP. And I'll have to give guidance on that a little bit later in the year, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. My follow-up if I may is probably for Greg, on his exploration in Guyana. Greg, couple of weeks ago Exxon suggested that Sorubim would be completed last weekend or thereabouts. I realize you're not the operator, but can you offer any color around what you might be seeing there in terms of the fact that it is taken over \u2013 it seems to be taking a little bit longer and what's on my mind there is Exxon had suggested that in a success case, there was a possibility of bringing our third rig into the basin. So, I'm just curious, if that's consistent with your thoughts and any color you can offer (27:57)? Thank you.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, Doug, thanks. I think the only thing we can say about Sorubim, right now is that well operations are still underway. And as I said in my opening remarks, following Sorubim that Bob Douglass is going to move and start drilling those development wells for Phase 1.","And then again, just to remind, everyone, we also have operations going on in Liza-5. Liza-5 has been logged, cored and is currently undergoing a drill stem test, so that's sort of where we are on the block in terms of exploration and appraisal right now.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Do you have a connectivity result on Liza-5 yet, Greg?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, we don't yet, Doug, it's early in the test sequence.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks guys, I'll leave it there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Morris of Citi. Your line is now open.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Nice progress in the quarter, gentlemen.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Greg, on the Bakken, it seems that you're a bit more encouraged by what limited results you've had on the 200-stage plug-and-perf style completions here going forward.","And remind me, I think those costs maybe up to $500,000 per well more. And so, you did just raise the EURs based on the 60-stage sliding sleeve, but what sort of uplift are you thinking about or anticipating to sort of make this the go-forward design in moving to 200 stage plug-and-perf completions.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, thanks. Thanks for the question, Bob. In terms of the cost first, we're early in this process and costs are running between $6.5 million and $7 million for those 200-stage, 8.5 million pound proppant wells. But, we believe that's going to come down as we apply lean manufacturing just like we did with sliding sleeves. As we apply lean manufacturing to that process, we know that we'll be able to bring those costs down.","As I said in my opening remarks, we really don't have any wells that we have plug-and-perf. We have seven online right now, but we don't have any that are past their IP90 dates. So, it's a little bit premature. The results are encouraging, but it's premature because we just don't have a statistical enough sample yet to be definitive about what the uplift is. It's positive, but I don't want to get specific beyond that. Now, our plans are because of the encouraging results, we are going to complete 40 plug-and-perfs this year and we'll have 25 wells online by year-end. And as I also said in my opening remarks that data was going to be critical for the study that we're conducting on the Bakken, which is really designed to, on a go-forward basis, determine what now is the optimum methodology to use for each area of the field as we think about further development of the Bakken.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And my second question relates to that longer-term development plan we've had. Several companies talk about what they refer to as parent-child love relationships in other basins whereas some operators have said that in the Bakken, you actually see better performance from the infill wells versus the parallel, because parallel was drilled so long ago with older technology. Are you able to discern any relationship in that regard or is that just sort of being masked or overshadowed by the continued improvement in the type of completions you're applying here in trying to assess whether there is some degradation at some point on infill wells, or is it just too hard to tell with continuing to do better or higher intensity completions?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I think in the Bakken the performance just continues to get bigger and better with the improvements we're making in completion design. I will say for us because we drill half of the DSU at a time, we actually have no parent-child relationship because what we'll do is we'll go and we'll drill half of the 1280 acres and then maybe 12 months to 18 months later, we'll come back and drill the other half of the 1280 acres. So that really minimizes any interference at all. So, there's no impact to us.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Maybe the first question on CapEx. It was relatively light in the quarter, how much of that was timing related? Fewer well completions in the Bakken in the quarter are you seeing any continued efficiencies that could drive lower than expected CapEx for the year?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Right now, it's really timing. I mean we were early in the year that always happens with our CapEx program. And as you know, as Greg mentioned, so as we move through the year we're bringing in a fifth rig into the Bakken in the third quarter and then the sixth six rig in the fourth quarter. And then also now, as Greg mentioned, we are going to have two rigs running in Guyana. So, there is as we move through the year was kind of more back-ended on the CapEx. So, again, everything is going with the execution and the CapEx plan is going really well. But at this point, I would still tell you 2.1 (33:23) for the year.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then maybe you touched \u2013 obviously we touched already on asset disposals. There have been and are a number of packages and probably may continue to be packages being shopped in the Bakken. Would you guys have any interest in acquiring additional resource in the Bakken, or would you consider most of the deals as being dilutive relative to your current asset quality, or what would you need to see to be interested in picking up additional resource there?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Look we're always looking to optimize our portfolio. Having said that anything that we could potentially acquire would have to compete with a high return projects we already have secured in our portfolio between the Bakken and Guyana. And thus far we haven't seen any package in the market that would compete favorably in terms of what we have already under our feet.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","On costs, can you discuss progress towards your cost reduction targets and milestones that you and we should be looking for? And can you also discuss the service cost environment in the Bakken as you add the two rigs and one crew?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. Brian I'll start on the cost reduction program, it is going along according to our plan. I mean you could see from the \u2013 as a milestone we did have the severance charge in the first quarter. As I mentioned the \u2013 from a head count standpoint there's approximately 400 employees and contractors affected by the reduction in force. Now not all, it's a little bit above 65% of those employees have left the company in the first quarter. And so there will continue to be reductions in force as we move through the year. As far as other aspects of our plan I mean we're starting here in the first quarter and what I would tell you with our plan we expect to have everything done by the fourth quarter. And then in the fourth quarter combined with the Enchilada field, the Conger coming back online and our increase in the Bakken you should begin to see the effects of our $150 million cost reduction program as well as the investments in our higher return assets driving our costs lower.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","And Brian in terms of the cost trends in the Bakken, you know cost trends are expected to increase anywhere from 5% to 15% versus last year depending on which commodity line you're talking about. But we've taken steps to contain those costs by locking in rig rates, putting in place longer term contracts, and forming strategic partnerships with our key suppliers. So, the steps we've taken coupled with our lean manufacturing approach, we're pretty confident that we can deliver our 2018 program with minimal inflation.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is that you mentioned that I think you bought back the portion of the hedges collars that now give you exposure to the oil price upside about $65, I may have missed if you mentioned if there was a cost, cost to do that or an effective dollar barrel to do that. But now that there is more exposure to the upside to the degree that oil prices do stay here or move higher. Can you talk about how that impacts capital allocation either in terms of using that cash for incremental share repurchase or debt pay down or for reinvesting in the business?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah, right now, obviously, we're keeping the downside protection. But we felt it is prudent in the current oil environment to buy those collars back. John can talk further on the cost of that. So, we will benefit and our shareholders will benefit in the higher oil price environment that we're in. And again, our priority number one, two and three is to fund Guyana and future capital requirements not just for FPSO-1 but FPSO-2 and also the engineering for FPSO-3, continue the exploration and appraisal program and in that \u2013 and move up to six rigs in the Bakken, in that it's really important and we've talked about this before to keep a strong balance sheet and cash position.","So you know, incremental cash right now will just be keeping that balance sheet strong for the funding requirements that we see going forward. In terms of any further share repurchases to be contemplated, one let's finish the $1.5 billion program we have which we will do this year, and two, as we look into next year, we'll see where our capital requirements are specifically on Guyana and we'll see where the oil prices and at that time we can give consideration to further return of capital to shareholders.","John, you might want to talk about the other.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure, on cost of the buying out the call options, it was approximately $50 million. Now in my guidance that I gave that is reflected in the amortization of the premiums on our hedge contract. So as I mentioned, so for the next three quarters of 2018, the results will be reduced by $45 million a quarter due to the buyout of those call options.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I just have a quick question. And on the Bakken, Greg, have you seen any cost inflation really start to picking up? I mean, Permian we heard that they have difficulty getting enough staff or equipment that when they start to see some other area they're moving the equipment and people there. So how's that looking in the course and the availability of the equipment?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And also when you're talking about Bakken can you also talk about you're saying that you're going to reach a 175,000 barrel per day by 2021, is that the better way (39:51) or that's subject to say other factor that you may change what is the better way (39:59)?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, first of all, on the cost trends, Paul, thanks for the question. As I responded to the last person, you know, we do expect the cost trends they increased by some 5% to 15%, very different than the Permian simply because if you look at the rate of growth of rigs in the Bakken it's much smaller than it is in the Permian. So, it's kind of onesie, twosie I say, people growing by one or two rigs. So, the rate of increase is not substantial.","Now, we've taken a lot of steps to contain those costs by locking in some rig rates, putting in place longer term contracts, forming strategic partners with our key suppliers. And we're pretty confident that the steps we've taken and our lean manufacturing approach is going to enable us to deliver our 2018 program with minimal inflation. There'll be some but it'll be minimal, we think we can cover most of that. So very different than the Permian.","Regarding the 175,000 barrels of oil a day in 2021 that's the only assumption in there is that we maintain six rigs for the next couple of years to get us to the 175,000 barrels of oil a day.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But, should we look at it from a resource standpoint and holistically that that will be the sweet spot you're going to get to 175,000 barrels of oil a day and you're just going to staying at that level for a number of years or that may change also? So trying to understand what you guys have in mind and targeting?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, I think at this point the 175,000 barrels of oil a day is appears to be the sweet spot. Then we can maintain that for several years in the Bakken and of course, that's a combination of infrastructure build out and whatnot. And that's why the 175,000 barrels of oil a day appears to be a sweet spot. The only caveat I will put on that is we are conducting this comprehensive Bakken study this year and so depending on the outcomes of that study that could dictate how long you hold that peak, how fast you get there are some other factors. So that's the only caveat I'd put on that.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And let's go back into the cause. Have you seen people and the equipment being moved out from Bakken into Permian?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Not. Certainly, it hasn't affected us at all and that's all that I'm concerned about, is that it doesn't affect us.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And for John Rielly that the second question on the unit DD&A why from the first quarter to the second quarter you were jumped that much?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So from the guidance that we gave you remember Paul, since we're giving the guidance ex-Libya on there. So, if you're looking at actual costs that we had in the first quarter going into our second quarter guidance, so without Libya, right, our production is going to be lower, our cash costs are going to be lower and our DD&A. I'm sorry our cash costs will be higher and our DD&A will be higher and then our tax rate will be lower. So, there's really no change if you want to say quarter-on-quarter for the DD&A. It's just from a guidance purposes, we don't have Libya in there.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So that if I \u2013 so maybe then, let me ask then in the first quarter if you are excluding Libya, what was the cash cost and unit DD&A?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So that you could add about \u2013 yes, you can add about a $1.50 to the DD&A rate and you can add about $1 to the cash cost.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see. So that's why you're saying that sequentially, as we need not such a big difference in anywhere.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Correct, correct.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.","Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just to kick a little harder on the Bakken on the kind of service costs, and just what's going on there in terms of productivity. Are you seeing pressure on the pricing side, I know the question was asked about kind of labor and so forth. But any general pressure on any part of the service sector there for you?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I think you know as I said before that, here the cost trends are expected to increase 5% to 15% depending on the commodity line. You're talking about on the upper end would be the pumping services, on the lower end it would be the sand and kind of other commodities. So \u2013 but again with the steps we've taken by locking in the rig rates, putting in place longer term contracts, forming the strategic partnership with our key suppliers and lean manufacturing. We think that, we can execute our 2018 program with relatively minimal inflation.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then switching gears a little bit, your \u2013 the Gulf of Mexico has come back a little quicker than expected. I know you still are predicting the last part of it or budgeting the last part of it for late September. But is there a rational way to approach that, a reasonable way to approach that, that it could come on a little bit quicker just sort of gone by what the operators been saying?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yeah. So, I think as we said the instantaneous rate that was off at the end of year was 30,000 barrels a day after that came on in the first quarter, in March the other half we're projecting to be on by the start of the fourth quarter. The operator is still forecasting kind of June, July sort of a timeframe, so yes, there could be a little bit of upside, but obviously that depends on weather and all kinds of factor. So, we've got a little bit more conservatism built-in given it's a brownfield project, and we'll just see kind of where we end up.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just the last question on the Sorubim well, if I remember correctly, it's sort of a different structure than what we saw with Payara, so the fact that it's taking a little longer to drill that, I would assume make sense or was within the budgeted expectations?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yeah, it's definitely within the budgeted expectations, and yes, it is a different play type, it's onlapping sediments on to a carbonate shelf margin, so.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","And, I can add just from a cost standpoint, because that is some of the benefits of drilling exploration wells in Guyana, just that typical exploration well there is our gross well cost is around $50 million, so net to us is about $15 million. So that's kind of a typical exploration well there.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks for taking the question, everyone.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","So, the Bakken production during the quarter, obviously, seemed especially strong in light of you guys only bringing on 13 wells, and some of the plug-and-perf wells likely contributed, but can you talk a little bit more about the outperformance and how well productivity is shaping up relative to what is assumed in the full-year production guidance of 115,000 to 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It just appears that that guidance might be a little conservative due to what you guys delivered at 1Q and the schedule and the number of wells you're planning to bring on the rest of the year?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. A couple of comments. First of all that, the first quarter was strong and that was mainly driven by drilling wells in Keene, which is really our best area of the field. So that mix changes as you go throughout the year, but Keene performed particularly well during the first quarter and in our Investor pack, we show the IP180s in Keene and Stony Creek and East Nesson and Capa. And we've said, those IPs are north of 100,000 barrels, IP180s north of 100,000 barrels.","Keene is coming exceptionally strong. So, if you weight average that and assume that Keene is going to continue to perform, our IP180s for the year will actually be some 15% to 20% higher than what's in our current investor pack. And that's a step-up from last year as we said of 10% to 15%. So yes, there's upside, driven mainly by Keene. If you look at East Nesson South, Stony Creek and Capa, they're coming in at about where we expected, but Keene has really outperformed. So very strong performance from Keene.","As I said, the plug-and-perf wells, we just don't have enough to be statistically significant. There's only seven online, none of which have gone beyond IP90. So, it's just early days on that. But, it is encouraging. So, there is a little bit of additional volume associated with those plug-and-perf wells.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's helpful. Thank you. And then you all have been clear that the top priority for capital is prefunding Guyana. I was just hoping you could shed a little bit more light on the longer term plans there? And specifically, how you see the balance of cash inflow versus CapEx shaping up over time, especially with three phases happening and the discovered resource to do much more than that. But you all have highlighted rapid cash pay back there, cost recovery will help I'm sure. But can you just talk through maybe in a little bit more detail or give us a framework as to what point Guyana actually becomes self-funding or begins to generate excess cash flow on kind of base case expectations or plans?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Sure. So, the way as we mentioned in the scripts earlier, Phase 1 Exxon is planning to bring on by 2020. When that production comes on, we're beginning to pick up significant cash flow, but Guyana itself is going to be still maybe more in a breakeven to maybe a slight deficit as we go forward with Phase 2 and Phase 3 capital. Then what happens when Phase 2 comes on and remember that's a bigger FPSO 220,000 barrels per day, when that comes on and let's just say it's two years for now somewhere mid-ish 2022, just for an assumption standpoint. Guyana begins to throw off significant free cash flow at that point in time. So, our production with our 30% share in there gets over 100,000 barrels a day once that ship comes on in Guyana, then basically that supports all future capital in Guyana once the Phase 2 production comes on.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, that makes sense. And then I had one more follow-up on the 1Q cash flow number, but the pre-working capital cash flow number looked very strong, but obviously there were some meaningful working capital headwinds that you all called out. You had a large working capital drag last year, but with the divestment of some of your cash consuming assets, we'd expected that issue to maybe go away this year. So, can you talk a little bit more about the extent to which some of these issues that affected 1Q bottom line cash flow may or may not persist going forward?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Sure. So, what we have in the first quarter, let me just first talk about kind of, if you want to call it normal, but still non-recurring type pulls on working capital in the first quarter. So, as we said, there was a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. What happens in the first quarter, typically most companies, we're paying our bonuses in the first quarter. So, you're accruing through the year and then you're paying that bonus. So, you have that always in the first quarter. And then in our first and third quarters is where we pay basically semi-annually then the interest payments on our public bonds.","So typically, you'll see a type of working capital pull for interest payments in our first and third quarter. Then the other one now, this is not recurring, I mentioned earlier was, we bought our call options on the WTI, so that was approximately $50 million. That will not recur. And then the only other thing I need to remind everyone on is, is we are still going through kind of the remnants of our portfolio reshaping, and we are going through a cost reduction program. So for example, we have that severance, we will be then paying severance off in the remainder of the year. So, you're going to see still some remnants of that portfolio reshaping and that's why I like to say, as I mentioned earlier, by the fourth quarter, we'll have gotten through our cost reduction program and all that benefits will begin to be shown through as you see in the fourth quarter and then into 2019. So again, nothing unusual except for really the buyout of the WTI call options and then further transition costs you may see through the year.","Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. I guess I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of things. First, in the Williston, I think there's some tighter flaring regulations coming in in the back half of the year. How are you guys set up to handle that? And then second, in the second quarter on that 115,000 BOE a day what's the expected wells put to sales to support that?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Okay. So, on the first question, we don't have any issue with the flaring regulations coming up, we're set up well for that, why? Because we have 250 million cubic feet capacity at Tioga Gas Plant that can be expanded to 300 million cubic feet for very little capital, we won't need that this year but that's certainly an option out in the future. Q1 processing volumes are 214 million cubic feet, so you can see that we've got, we've got room to go there.","And then secondly, thinking ahead we're adding a 100 million cubic feet of net capacity south of the river at the Targa JV that are Midstream announced. So because of those reasons we'll be set up \u2013 we'll be set up well for handling any flaring constraints.","And your second question...","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","...was related to wells, is that correct?","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah, just how many wells do you expect to have turned to sales in the second quarter?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yes, our current forecast is to have 23 wells online in the second quarter versus 13 wells in the first quarter.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then, I guess the other follow-up is on, just uses of capital in this more elevated commodity environment. What would you say a targeted debt level would be on a dollar basis as you look towards 2019, 2020 just kind of on a longer-term basis as you enter the full Guyana development phase?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Our plan is that, we can fund, so we set up through our asset sale program that we pre-funded Guyana. So, we do not intend to go to the debt markets for any additional requirements for Guyana or for anything else that we have. So, we're set up from a pre-funded standpoint. So, you could expect our debt level to stay where it is after we finish our debt reduction initiative.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah. I guess, I was thinking the other side, are there any further debt reduction targets that you think through on a longer database (56:13)?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","This is \u2013 John Hess mentioned earlier. So, what we'll do is, as we finish out this debt reduction plan, the $500 million and our stock buyback of $1.5 billion, as we'll finish that out. Again, our priorities are to make sure that we have Guyana pre-funded, because that's truly transformational. And then maintain a strong balance sheet. So, we want to be investment grade, maintain that investment grade, balance sheet, and then excess cash beyond that, we will be considering for stock buybacks or debt buybacks at that time.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. You've been asked about costs in the U.S., I would kind of expand that to what you're seeing in the offshore arena. So, as you're contracting for new rigs or development equipment in Indiana, how are those costs tracking relative to your original expectations from when Liza project was originally sanctioned a year ago?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Great. Thanks for the question, Pavel. The Deepwater offshore market continues to be oversupplied given the extended period of low activity that John talked about in his opening remarks. And as a result, we expect to see minimal if any cost inflation. In terms of Guyana Phase 2 versus Phase 1, costs are coming in lower, actually lower than for Phase 1 for most of the commodity line. So again, you're seeing that continue to oversupply reflect itself in Guyana Phase 2 as well.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then a quick one about the dividends. So, it's been about five years since you've taking that down to $0.25 a quarter. Is that, at all, on the agenda as far as an increase goes alongside the buyback that you're implementing?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","On the dividend itself, that we want to see us being cash flow generative with our current capital requirements and our current dividend on a recurring basis for us to consider going up on that. We're not quite there yet. Obviously 2020, we start seeing our company being cash flow generative in a $50 world on a recurring basis. So, at that time, we can consider what's the best way to enhance return of capital to shareholders. And obviously, I talked earlier about how we're thinking about next year in terms of capital through share repurchases based upon funding Guyana, and keeping a strong balance sheet and cash position for future Phase of Guyana. And obviously, the oil price environment. So that sort of how we think about return of capital.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McAllister of MUFG Securities. Your line is now open.","Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Thank you for taking my call. My question is about the Bakken, the scenario you're kind of presenting it's looking like a 50% increase in rigs could lead to a 30% increase in wells tilled for 2019?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","So again, yeah we are taking the rig count up. We'll add a fifth rig in third quarter and a sixth rig in fourth quarter. So that's true our actual wells online will go up in 2019 relative to 2018.","Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","And can I take that further to say that production would be or could be 20% to 25% higher?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, I think you know again, thinking about where we are on the road to 175,000 BOE in 2021, you're right the rate of increase will go up in 2019 as a result of that higher number of wells online.","Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. And then to 2019 any thoughts on hedging at these prices?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So, we will be you know we continue to look at our hedging program. We've made some changes as you know in 2018. As of right now, we don't have any hedges on in 2019. We're continuing to look at it. Obviously, the curve is a bit backward dated and when you're this far from 2019, it is expensive on that time value with the volatility. So, at this point, we haven't had anything, but we'll continue to look at that.","And then, obviously, as we continue move up as Greg was saying with the Bakken increase in production, production increase in next year, we don't have as much of a cash deficit as you move into 2019 and we don't have a funding deficit at all because of the asset sales. So any hedging we probably do would not be at the same level we did in 2018, but we'll continue to look at putting hedges on in 2019.","Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","All right. Thank you for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Greg, I was wondering if you could just maybe comment a little bit more on the study you're doing in the Bakken to determine the optimal development methodology and just give us a sense of what you're looking at and how could things potentially change?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. So I think, it's the right time to do the study in the Bakken because the Bakken is at an inflection point. We're adding rig count. We're changing, potentially changing methodology on completion type. And so, it's a good time just to step back and say, okay given that plug-and-perf looks like it's coming into the mix, how do we think about our development methodologies for various parts of the field. What's that mean for the core? What's that mean for outside the core? What's that mean for well spacing? Does that change our thinking on well spacing? All of these factors are going to go into this study to really define in the back-half of the year what is our revised development methodology going forward in the Bakken.","So it's really a good time to do it, because we have more DSUs in the core than anyone else, we're stepping up the rig count, so it's time to just step back and really think thoughtfully where \u2013 how we want to take this asset forward.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And results will be later this year or something like that?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, it will be, I think we've talked about in Investor Day, fourth quarter of the year, we'd obviously share our result for that in the Investor Day.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And just my follow-up, it sounds like results in 1Q in the Bakken outperformed, just given a better than results at Keene. Could you talk a little bit about the mix of the Keene versus outside of Keene for your 2018 completions? And would you think that your overall Bakken guidance is conservative just given the performance at Keene?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, again it's early in the air and Keene did outperform. And if you look at our programs of the 95 wells that we've guided to be online this year, 40 of those wells are in Keene, 25 of those are in Stony Creek, 20 are in East Nesson South and 10 are in Capa. And if you look at our investor presentation we actually showed the EURs in the IP180s for each of those areas. As I said Stony Creek, East Nesson South and Capa are coming in at about what we expected. But Keene is one that's really so far outperforming this year.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is now open.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yeah. Thank you. Following-up on what you were saying on the Bakken, Greg. Does this mean you're trying to better figure out your spacing densities, or should we assume that given the results of your study down the line that may go to longer wells in terms of the completions?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I think, John, thanks for the question. I think all of that is part of what the study will look at. As you know, we've been developing the Bakken on very tight spacing and so fracture geometry control is really, really important given that you're on tight spacing with limited entry plug-and-perf now, the methodology is such that you can get tighter fracture geometry control, but also a lot more entry points in the wellbore.","So, if that's true that could affect your well spacing assumption, but way too early to predict what the outcome is going to be. That's one of the elements of the study that we'll be looking at. And it could vary depending on where you are on the field because obviously in the core you've got a lot more natural fracturing that's helping you out to get outside the core you don't have as much so all these things will be part of the study that we're looking at in the Bakken with the ultimate objective to maximize DSU and overall NPV for the Bakken asset.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Great. And one, the follow-up on Guyana. I was able to see Chorus (66:24) the other day with Exxon and it looked to me like the reservoirs weren't super well cemented, and look like calcite cements, were you at all surprised by that?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Not really. No. I \u2013 and it \u2013 again it's \u2013 these wells are going to produce like gangbusters as you know just based on your look at the core. So, we weren't surprised by it and we're not particularly concerned about it.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","No, I did think it was a concern I just...","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","... that looked like great rock. That's all.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Great rock. Yeah. Thanks","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO. Your line is now open.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I think the Penn State well in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be brought online in March and was just curious if there is any update here on timing, and also the rate of that well?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. So, the well did come on in March as planned and we're currently in ramp up operations on that well, just like Stampede wells, we're bringing these wells on slowly in the Miocene, adjusting the chokes slowly. That well is expected to be in the range of 5,000 barrels to 10,000 barrels a day once it gets to full choke.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. And then on the Bakken, you've talked about this asset as meaning to be a free cash generator to the corporation. Just looking at 2018 and maybe 2019, do you have a sense for what the free cash flow profiles of this asset would be at current oil prices, and how that can influence the decision to move beyond six rigs planned for year-end?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Sure. So again, at this point we are just planning on the fifth rigs and sixth rigs being added in the second half of the year with where prices are even with prices lower the Bakken was going to be generating a little free cash flow in 2018 and that's again because when you bring on the fifth and sixth rigs you're really not getting any production from those rigs yet that goes into 2019. Then as we increase production, it was 1920, then getting up to the 175,000 barrels a day and obviously holding six rigs, the Bakken will generate significant cash flow.","A lot in 2019 and even more in 2020 and 2021 and that that's says, we've always said in the near-term that's what's driving us to be able to be free cash flow positive at $50 Brent post 2020 and then it's when Guyana and really that Phase 2 comes in that really continues to drive up our free cash flow.","So, at this point in time we \u2013 there's no plans to go above the six rigs or a 175,000 barrel at a target is on that six rigs. But as Greg said, we are looking, we're doing a study and we'll let you know, if we make any changes but at this point in time there is no change to our six rigs.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Lisa and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our Web-site, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our Web-site.","With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I will provide some key highlights from 2014 and guidance for 2015. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and John Rielly will review our financial results.","Before covering the quarter and the year, I would like to provide some thoughts on the dramatic change in the oil market with the price of Brent dropping from $115 per barrel in June to approximately $49 per barrel today. While this price drop poses serious challenges for the entire industry, Hess continues to maintain a strong financial position with $2.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet at year-end and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 21%.","The current market weakness is driven by strong supply growth from U.S. unconventionals and weaker than expected global demand. In the past, during periods of oversupply, Saudi Arabia and a few other OPEC members would have reduced production to stabilize prices. This time, they decided to leave it to the market to rebalance, and consequently oil prices have plummeted.","The near-term impact is that many companies including ours are announcing significant reductions to their global investment programs which will begin to decrease unconventional and conventional production growth in the latter half of 2015 and even more so in 2016. All of the steps we have taken in the last several years have positioned us well to manage in this environment.","In addition to our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, our transformation to an E&P company has created a resilient portfolio of world-class assets that is balanced between unconventionals which offer lower-risk growth in a high price environment with the flexibility to moderate investment in a lower price environment, and our offshore assets which generate significant cash flows and also provide future growth opportunities.","Our financial strategy which we reviewed during our Investor Day last November is, first, to invest for returns; second, to manage our business to be cash generative over the long-term; third, to use our balance sheet in a given year like 2015 to fund the shortfall in operating cash flow; and finally, to maintain our investment-grade credit rating.","In keeping with this strategy, we are taking a disciplined approach to protect our financial strength in the current environment while preserving our long-term growth options. As announced on Monday, we will reduce our 2015 capital and exploratory expenditure budget to $4.7 billion, approximately 16% lower than our 2014 actual spend. We are reducing our 2015 annual spend in the Bakken to $1.8 billion compared to $2.2 billion in 2014 and plan to decrease our rig count to eight rigs by the second quarter compared to 17 rigs in 2014. In addition, we are actively pursuing cost reductions with service providers across our supply chain.","As for our share repurchase program, we are significantly moderating the pace of share repurchases in 2015 to preserve liquidity in the current oil price environment. Since commencement of the program in August of 2013, we have repurchased 62.8 million shares for $5.3 billion.","Now I would like to comment on some of the key highlights of our earnings release as well as our major accomplishments from 2014, which overall was a year of outstanding operating performance. First, 2014 adjusted net income was $1.3 billion and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $5.2 billion. Compared to 2013, our results were positively impacted by lower cash operating costs and exploration expenses which were more than offset by lower realized selling prices and higher depreciation expenses.","Second, in 2014, production averaged 329,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a pro forma basis excluding divestitures in Libya. In 2015, we forecast production to average between 350,000 and 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya.","Third, in 2014, we replaced 158% of production at an FD&A cost of approximately $28.75 per barrel of oil equivalent. At year-end, our proved reserves stood at 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent and our reserve life was 11.7 years.","Now I will review some of the accomplishments from 2014 starting with the Bakken where Hess continues its industry leadership. In late March, the expanded Tioga gas processing plant came online, which is key to our commitment to sustainable growth in North Dakota and is enabling us to significantly reduce flaring. The expansion increased the plant's gross inlet capacity to 250 million cubic feet per day and more than doubled its natural gas liquids processing capacity.","Throughout 2014, our Bakken team has continued to drive down drilling and completion costs and the productivity of our wells is among the highest in the industry. In the fourth quarter, we achieved the important milestone of net production exceeding 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Hess has a strong acreage position in the Bakken with more DSUs in the core of the play than any other competitor. For 2015, our net production from the Bakken is expected to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 83,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2014. We are still working to monetize our Bakken midstream assets through a master limited partnership. We expect the IPO to occur in 2015 subject to market conditions and we will continue to provide you with further updates as appropriate.","Turning to offshore, we continue to employ our top quartile drilling and project delivery capabilities. A major accomplishment in 2014 was the startup of the Tubular Bells Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess has a 57.1% interest in the project and is the operator. The field achieved first production approximately three years after project sanctioned. Net production is expected to average between 30,000 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015.","The Stampede project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess has a 25% working interest and is operator received full partner sanction for development in October 2014. Chevron, Statoil and Nexen, each have a 25% working interest. Total recoverable resources for Stampede are estimated in the range of 300 million to 350 million barrels of oil equivalent and first production is expected in 2018.","In Malaysia, full field development of the North Malay Basin project continue to progress, which should result in net production increasing to 165 million cubic feet per day in 2017. Hess is the operator with a 50% interest.","In terms of exploration, our strategy is to deliver long-term value by focusing on proven and emerging oil prone plays in basins we understand well and that leverage our capabilities. As we announced at our Investor Day, we secured farming opportunities in three deepwater blocks, Sicily in the Gulf of Mexico with Chevron as operator; the Stabroek block in Guyana with Esso E&P Guyana Limited as operator, and in Nova Scotia with BP as operator.","In summary, 2014 was a year of outstanding execution and strong operating results with industry-leading performance in our unconventionals and offshore business. Our Company is well-positioned to manage through the current price environment with a strong balance sheet and resilient portfolio. Our 2015 budget reflects a disciplined approach to maintaining our financial strength and flexibility while preserving our long-term growth options. Just as important, we have top quartile operating capabilities and some of the best people in the industry to execute our plans and maximize shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill.","Gregory P. Hill","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an operational update on our progress in 2014 and our plans for 2015. In 2014, we demonstrated strong delivery of our plan across our unconventionals and offshore businesses and began rebuilding a top-quality exploration organization and portfolio. We exceeded the top end of our production guidance range while achieving a material reduction of approximately $200 million in our capital and exploratory spend against budget in response to the lower price environment.","In our unconventionals business, we delivered on our Bakken commitments while continuing our cost reductions and successfully progressing our infill pilots, leading to a significant increase in well inventory. In the Utica, results continued to encourage our transition from appraisal to early development. Offshore, we delivered first production from Tubular Bells, achieved full partner sanction on Stampede and made steady progress at Valhall and at North Malay Basin. We drilled some excellent wells at South Arne and Equatorial Guinea, successfully conducted our appraisal of Ghana and advanced our Equus project in Australia.","Starting then with production, in the fourth quarter net production averaged 352,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a pro forma basis excluding divestures in Libya. On that same basis, for the full year 2014 we achieved net production of 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which exceeded our beginning of the year guidance of 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Looking forward, in 2015 we forecast net production to average between 350,000 and 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, an increase of between 10% and 13% respectively over a pro forma production in 2014. On the same basis, we forecast net production in the first quarter of 2015 to average between 330,000 and 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which takes into account planned maintenance in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea.","Turning to the Bakken, in 2014 we continued to demonstrate excellent performance. We brought 238 new operated wells online and full-year net production averaged 83,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 24% versus 2013 and well within our guidance of 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent net per day. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 102,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 19% increase from the previous quarter and a 50% increase from the fourth quarter of 2013.","In 2014, our 30 day initial production rates have average between 800 and 950 barrels of oil equivalent per day, well above the industry average. Our continued focus on applying lean manufacturing practices to our operations enabled us to continue to drive down our Bakken drilling and completion costs with the fourth quarter averaging $7.1 million per well versus $7.6 million per well in the year ago quarter. We expect to further reduce costs both through ongoing efficiencies and by proactively addressing our cost structure in collaboration with our suppliers.","Based on our top quartile drilling and completion costs and the productivity of our wells, we continued to deliver some of the highest return wells in the play. As we mentioned on our last call and at our Investor Day last November, we have now moved to 13 wells per DSU as our standard basis of development. Also our two existing 17 well per DSU pilots are performing in line with expectations. So we plan to increase the total number of these to five in 2015.","The quality of our Bakken position provides a robust forward well inventory that's substantially all held by production. Given the current pricing environment, it makes sense to diverse some drilling until oil prices have moved higher. With this in mind, in 2015 we intend to reduce our activity from 14 rigs in the first quarter to eight in the second quarter, giving an average of 9.5 rigs for the year compared to 17 rigs in 2014 and we will remain flexible to respond to prices as appropriate.","Our 2015 capital budget for the Bakken is $1.8 billion, a reduction of some 18% from last year. With our reduced rig program, we nevertheless expect to drill and complete approximately 180 wells in 2015 and bring approximately 210 new wells online in total, compared to 238 new wells online in 2014. Bakken net production is expected to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the full year, an increase of 14% to 27% respectively on an annualized basis versus 2014.","Looking further ahead, the quality of our acreage and our well inventory on a 13 well per DSU development plan continues to support our longer-term net production target of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day for the Bakken. However, the timing of when this can be reached will be a function of oil price.","Moving to the Utica, the appraisal and early development of our 45,000 core net acres in the Hess-CONSOL joint venture continues to be encouraging. In 2014, the joint venture drilled 38 wells, completed 36 wells and brought 39 wells on production. Our drilling and completion costs on a dollars per foot and dollars per stage basis moved steadily lower by 28% and 17% respectively in 2014 as we began to apply the same lean manufacturing techniques that we used in the Bakken. As we move into development mode and continue to work with our suppliers in the lower oil price environment, we expect drilling and completion costs will be further reduced.","Net production for the year in the Utica averaged 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter. The joint venture intends to execute a two rig program in the core of the wet gas window during 2015. Our budget of $290 million for 2015 is dedicated to drilling 20 to 25 joint venture wells and we expect to bring 25 to 30 new wells online. In terms of net production, we expect to average between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015.","Turning to our offshore business, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico we commenced production at our Tubular Bells Field in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator. Sanctioned in October 2011 and fast-tracked to first oil in approximately three years, the project underlines Hess' ability to successfully execute complex deepwater development projects.","The first three producers are now online and production continues to build. A fourth producer reached target depth and encountered 290 feet of net pay. Current net production from the field is approximately 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and we plan to bring on one additional producer and continue to increase production over the course of 2015. We forecast net production to average between 30,000 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2015.","Also in the Gulf of Mexico, on October the Stampede development project in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator was sanctioned by all four partners. Drilling is expected to commence utilizing two rigs in late 2015 with first oil targeted for 2018.","In North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess holds a 50% working interest and is operator, progress continues on the first phase of field development. Engineering, procurement and construction activities are underway and commencement of development drilling is planned by Q4 of 2015. Full year net production averaged 40 million cubic feet per day through the early production system in 2014 and is expected to stay at this level through 2016. Upon completion of the full field development project in 2017, net production is planned to increase to 165 million cubic feet per day.","In Norway, at the BP operated Valhall Field in which Hess has a 64% interest, fourth quarter net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter, due in part to scheduled maintenance downtime in the fourth quarter of 2014. Full year 2014 net production averaged 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the previous year. In 2015, we expect Valhall net production to average between 30,000 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In Ghana, Hess and its partners are continuing to incorporate the data from the appraisal drilling in new 3D seismic into our models with a view to a sanction decision during 2016. Offshore Australia, we signed a letter of intent with the North West Shelf joint venture to process gas through LNG facilities at Karratha. Next steps will be to finalize commercial terms, complete FEED for the project and engage with LNG buyers in 2015 aiming for a sanction decision in 2017.","Moving to exploration, in Kurdistan where Hess has a 64% interest, we have suspended drilling of the Shireen-1 well on the Dinarta block due to drilling difficulties and are assessing options to complete the program. In the Gulf of Mexico, Chevron has begun drilling operations on the Sicily well where Hess has a 25% interest, which is targeting a four-way closure in the outward Paleocene. The operator expects to reach target depth in the third quarter of 2015.","In Guyana, we expect the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, to spud the offshore Liza-1 well in the Stabroek License in which Hess holds a 30% interest in March 2015. Liza is a large amplitude-supported Upper Cretaceous fan play.","Turning to offshore Nova Scotia where we hold a 40% license interest in blocks where BP is operator, Hess has been approved as a partner by the regulatory authorities and drilling is expected to commence in 2017.","In closing, 2014 was a year of exceptional execution and delivery on all fronts which is a tribute to the outstanding people of Hess. Although 2015 promises to be a challenging year for the industry, I believe Hess' portfolio and prospects have never been stronger.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted net income, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $377 million in the previous quarter. We estimate the fourth quarter decline in selling prices lowered net income by approximately $300 million net of hedging gains compared to the third quarter. On an unadjusted basis, the Corporation incurred a net loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with net income of $1,008 million in the third quarter.","Turning to exploration and production, E&P net income in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $92 million and $441 million in the third quarter. E&P adjusted earnings were $147 million in the fourth quarter and $412 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted net income for E&P between the third and fourth quarter were as follows. Lower realized selling prices decreased earnings by $303 million. Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $132 million. Higher exploration expenses decreased earnings by $56 million. Higher DD&A expense decreased earnings by $22 million. All other items net to a decrease in earnings of $16 million, for an overall decrease in fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $265 million.","Our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 1 million barrels in the fourth quarter, resulting in an increased after-tax income of approximately $9 million. The E&P effective income tax rate excluding items affecting comparability of earnings was 58% for the fourth quarter and 41% in the third quarter of 2014. The increase in the effective tax rate reflects the impact of higher Libyan production. When the Libyan operations are also excluded, the effective tax rate was 41%.","Turning to corporate and interest, corporate and interest expenses after income taxes were $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $82 million in the third quarter. The increased costs in the fourth quarter were a result of lower capitalized interest and higher professional fees and other administrative expenses.","Turning to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter including an increase of $80 million from changes in working capital was $1,057 million. Capital expenditures were $1,566 million. Common stock acquired and retired was $1,077 million. Net repayments of debt were $37 million. Common stock dividends paid were $71 million. All other items amounted to an increase in cash of $18 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $1,676 million.","Turning to our stock repurchase program, during the fourth quarter we purchased approximately 13.3 million shares of common stock bringing total 2014 purchases to approximately 43.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $3.7 billion. As of January 27, total program to date purchases were 62.8 million shares at a cost of $5.27 billion or $83.91 per share.","Turning to our financial position, we had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014, up from $1.8 billion at the end of last year. Total debt was $6 billion at December 31, 2014 and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2013. The Corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 21.2% at December 31, 2014 and 19% at the end of 2013. Going forward, we expect to utilize our strong cash position and balance sheet to manage through this low commodity price cycle.","Turning to 2015 guidance and starting with exploration and production, in addition to the production and capital expenditure guidance provided by John and Greg, I would like to provide estimates for certain 2015 metrics based on our expected production range of 350,000 to 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which assumes no contribution from Libya.","For the full year 2015, E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $19.50 to $20.50 per barrel, which is down approximately 5% before any realization of our cost saving initiatives. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses are expected to be in the range of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel reflecting greater contributions from Bakken and Tubular Bells which both have higher DD&A rates than the portfolio average. Total production unit costs for 2015 are estimated to be in the range of $48 to $50 per barrel. Full year 2015 exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $400 million to $420 million.","For the first quarter of 2015, excluding Libyan operations, cash costs are expected to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel due to maintenance downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea, and DD&A rates are expected to be in the range of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel, for total production unit costs of $49 to $51 per barrel. Exploration expenses in the first quarter excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million.","Based on current Strip oil prices, we are forecasting a pre-tax loss for 2015 and as a result the E&P effective tax rate excluding items affecting comparability is expected to be a benefit in the range of 38% to 42% excluding Libyan operations. On the same basis as the full-year guidance, the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 is expected to be a benefit in the range of 40% to 44%.","Turning to corporate and interest, for the full year of 2015 corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million net of taxes, and interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million net of taxes. For the first quarter of 2015, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million net of taxes and interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million net of taxes.","Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to inform you the quarterly earnings supplement posted on our Web-site has been augmented this quarter to include more detailed information regarding our Utica shale operations. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Doug Leggate","John and Greg, I guess I haven't spoken to you guys yet, so Happy New Year. I wondered if I could take two questions please. The first one is really on the prospective cash burn for the current year. I understand the balance sheet is in terrific shape given all the moves from last year, but what are you guys assuming in terms of the commodity environment, because obviously if oil prices don't recover, this level of spending pretty much burns through your cash flow pretty quickly, so can you give some framework as to how the CapEx may change if oil prices don't recover, and I have a follow-up please?","John P. Rielly","Sure, Doug. I appreciate the question and the difficulty with the environment but we're not going to speculate right now on where oil prices are going to end up through 2015. So now having said that, we are well-positioned going into this low priced commodity cycle. So first, proactively we have been reducing our CapEx, we did reduce that as you saw in 2014 and we've made further reductions in 2015. And as was mentioned by both John and Greg, we have the ability to reduce it further if needed. We are reducing our stock repurchase program, we're significantly moderating that, and then as you mentioned with our strong cash position, we have $2.4 billion of cash, and our strong balance sheet position, we can utilize this cash and the balance sheet to get through this low priced commodity cycle. So we think we're in great position from that standpoint and we're just going to see where oil prices end up throughout the year.","Doug Leggate","Great. Thanks, John. My follow-up is for Greg. Greg, we've got something like last time I looked about a $20 contango and the oil price for the next three years which approximates I guess to about two-thirds, 70% of production from our Bakken well, can you help us understand the decision to go ahead and retain the completion rate at such a high level, and talk to what does the new type curve look like for the 2015 program, and I guess finally, what are your expectations for drilling and completion cost reductions as you move forward over in this cost environment, a low price environment? I'll leave it there, thank you.","Gregory P. Hill","Thanks, Doug, that's really three questions, so let me try and answer all. First of all, at current prices, what you were talking about was really, what are your returns in the Bakken, why should you go forward? So just some context, as we mentioned at our Investor Day in November, recall that we have 60% more DSUs in the core of the Bakken than any other operator, and our 2015 drilling program is focused in the best areas of this core. Secondly, as you know our well costs are some of the lowest in the industry, our well IPs are well above the industry average. So that means we're delivering some of the highest returns in the industry.","So given all these advantages, our current prices were delivering incremental returns that meet or exceed our hurdle rate. And finally given our large position in the core, we see a multiyear inventory of drilling at these current activity levels and pricing. I think the final thing I would say is, we really want to maintain capability. We have a world-class lean manufacturing team and capability and we have a strong desire to maintain that as much as possible.","As far as service cost, we're starting to see some response and we're in very active discussions with all of our suppliers. So it's premature to kind of speculate on where those are going to go, they're going to go down but I can't tell you how much or how fast at this point in time.","I think the third thing relating to type curves, we're going to be in that 800 to 950 kind of an initial IP rate in this core of the core. So we'll be probably towards the upper end of that but that's probably still a good range for us.","Doug Leggate","Good, thanks very much. When you said you've got several years of drilling, you mean not type of well curve, you have a multiyear inventory that you can continue to focus on?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, at current activity levels and current pricing we have a multiyear inventory to go forward.","Doug Leggate","With a positive return?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, sir.","Doug Leggate","Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks very much for answering the questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Baber with Simmons & Company. Please proceed.","Guy Baber","John, you made a comment in the prepared remarks about the impact that lower spending could have on production for the industry overall, especially as we move into 2016. So I was hoping you could elaborate on those comments and maybe what you might expect for the Hess portfolio specifically in 2016, and then in the Bakken especially. I'm assuming spending remains relatively constrained relative to the plans presented at the November Analyst Day, if you could just give maybe some thoughts around kind of the 2016 production trajectory?","John B. Hess","Yes, in terms of the industry, a lot of the announcements of companies' plans including ours have been announced for 2015 where their significant reductions and their unconventional programs and as you all know many unconventional wells on the oil side have about a 70% decline in the first year, and as these programs through the year get feathered in with reduced rigs running, the growth year on year of unconventionals being up 1 million barrels a day or so year versus year in the U.S. because of unconventional, we see that attenuating quite a bit to where it flattens out probably the beginning of next year.","So a lot of the unconventional growth both for the industry and ourselves at the rig counts being anticipated should flatten out, and our Company itself also will have that but it's great pointing out we're going to still be able even in these oil prices to drill very attractive returns in the core of the core and we're very fortunate to be in a position to do that for several years.","So our whole focus here is to maintain our financial strength and flexibility while still preserving our long-term growth options, but we do believe with the decrease in investment programs for the industry and the consequent levelling out of production growth, oil prices will recover starting next year.","Guy Baber","That's very helpful. And then one follow-up for me in the Bakken also, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the relationship between well count which was down 12% year-over-year and the rig count which was obviously down much more substantially, but could you just talk a little bit about the backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells the over what timeframe you might bring those online through 2015 and what impact that could have to production? And then also, if you could just comment on the implicit efficiency gains for rigs that you're assuming kind of in 2015, because it seems as if you guys were already expecting some efficiency gains that you talked about at the November Analyst Day, but your numbers seem to imply even greater efficiency gains, and just trying to get a sense of how conservative you might feel those are and what type of opportunities did you see with some of the tailwinds from a lower commodity price environment?","Gregory P. Hill","Let me hit the rig question first. I think really the question you're asking is that rig count is going down about 45%, yet the capital is only going down by about 18%, so why is that. And that's all because of the continuing efficiency gains from our lean manufacturing. So we expect to drill approximately 20% more wells per rig in 2015. So that's 18 plus wells per rig in 2015 versus 15 per rig in 2014. So what that means is we expect to bring online 210 new wells in 2015 versus 238 in 2014. So you're exactly right, there is quite a bit of efficiency gains expected in our plans. And I think that broadly answers the question that you were trying to ask.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.","Brian Singer","Sorry for the delay there. Two questions. First, can you talk to the service and development cost reduction that you are seeing versus expecting and how offshore compares to onshore?","Gregory P. Hill","First of all, again as I said in my remarks on the last question, here it's early days, right. I mean the discussions are ongoing as we speak with suppliers. So it's premature to speculate how low will it go, how quickly will you see those cost reductions throughout the value chains.","In respect to offshore, recall we contracted two rigs even before the price environment to next generation deepwater drilling rigs. We contracted those for 400,000 a day. That was a major reduction over what those rigs would have contracted for say even 18 months ago, alright.","Now, if you think about the offshore though, this is probably the best time to be in the development phase of an offshore project because we know and we are seeing already some significant cost reductions in all those offshore services. So as you develop and then those developments come online, in Stampede's case in 2018, it's probably the best time in the cycle to be in development mode for those projects.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks. And my follow-up is, going back to your November Analyst Meeting, you indicated that Hess was interested in acquisitions, but I may be paraphrasing here, but the valuations at the time were not attractive despite the drop from June highs. That valuations in oil prices have obviously changed since then, and wondered if you could give us your latest thoughts on M&A and what may or may not make sense for Hess?","John B. Hess","Appreciate that. Obviously as opportunities arise, we'll be in a position to evaluate them with the strong financial position we have. It would have to still make sense both strategically and financially. So we're definitely on the lookout and we'll be in a position to move forward if something made sense, but at the same time our priority still will be to maintain our financial strength and flexibility and preserve our long-term growth options.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Ryan Todd","Maybe a follow-up on one of the earlier questions on CapEx, I realize that the near-term volatility in commodity makes it very hard, as you talked about, in 2015, but maybe if we think about the medium term view, say the next two to three years, I mean how should we think about your willingness to outspend in terms of [indiscernible] suggest on a multiyear basis there was an effort to be cash positive, is that still the view and how does that inform kind of the two or three year view from here?","John P. Rielly","So it is clearly our focus that over the long-term that we want to generate free cash flow. So obviously with the significant decline, it's come on fast, and we are in a good position with our cash levels of $2.4 billion in our balance sheet to spend, to utilize some of that cash and balance sheet strength to get through this cycle. So with the current uncertainties, in the mid-term and long term, we naturally have a range of price scenarios under which we're evaluating our forward activity and production outlook. So again, the pace of spend and the growth will depend on that oil price and that's what's going to impact our longer-term growth rate as well as our free cash flow over the period. But we will continue to focus over the long-term to generate free cash flow.","Ryan Todd","So I guess should we think like on a two years out, three years out, there's still a target to be cash flow positive at that point and depending on commodity you'll adjust accordingly for 2015?","John P. Rielly","Yes.","Ryan Todd","Okay. And then maybe a follow-up, I know we've talked to a decent amount about drilling and completion cost in the Bakken, can you say what was the implied drilling and completion cost per well in the 2015 budget, did you make any assumption, I know you made assumptions for efficiency gain, did you make any assumption for cost deflation, and if not, is that a source of potential downward pressure on the budget from here?","\\","John P. Rielly","Yes, I think so, all-in \u2013 so I'm going to talk DC&F, all in cost assumptions in 2015 was 8.3 and that gives you a D&C cost of around 6.8. So that's the assumption in our current plan.","Ryan Todd","Okay, and that's apples-to-apples versus the 7.1 number that you saw in 4Q?","John P. Rielly","Yes, it is, and that 7.1 is D&C.","Ryan Todd","Okay, great. Thanks. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Evan Calio","This is maybe a follow-up question on the Bakken and the well inventory drawdown, it looks like you added something 30 wells to the uncompleted Bakken inventory in the quarter, but can you give us the number of what the current total inventory of uncompleted and completed yet not tied in wells are and as the inventory drawdown for 2015 agnostic to the commodity price or should we kind of expect that to grow into recovery, so I understand how that works?","Gregory P. Hill","So we carried about 50 wells into 2015 from 2014 that were uncompleted. Obviously we're going to work that inventory down because we plan to drill about 180 wells yet bring 210 wells online. So you'll see we'll draw that inventory down. I think the carryout at the end of the year is anticipated to be around 20 wells or so, so a net gain of 30.","Evan Calio","And was that something that would have occurred regardless of the commodity price, I'm just trying to understand if that's a more kind of normal number going forward?","Gregory P. Hill","No, because those wells were all drilled in the core, we were already drilling in the core on those wells.","Evan Calio","That makes sense. And then another question on maybe kind of a follow-up on the cost side for Stampede, I mean how much of that cost structure is locked in or is available to potentially rebid given an accelerating downturn likely in the offshore spending market?","John P. Rielly","So first of all about 50% had been contracted through the end of 2014. Now we're looking at opportunities to reduce the costs in those contracts and we also expect lower contracts in the ones yet to be awarded. They are lower costs and those are yet to be awarded. And recall, production doesn't commence until 2018. So we've got three years of spend here that we can really work the cost hard on before it comes online in 2018.","Evan Calio","Great. And then maybe one last one if I could, not to beat a dead horse, but I mean just trying to understand commodity price, not trying to make a forecast, what commodity price you're using to set the budget, and maybe it's something that is more fluid, do we need changes to the marketplace and do you expect to be I guess assessing that on maybe a more frequent time period?","John B. Hess","Obviously we're dealing with the reality of current prices, and while we can't predict them and certainly believe they will recover, we're also going to be in a position to adapt further should they be deeper and longer. So they are very unpredictable right now and we think the prudent thing is to focus on financial strength and preserving our liquidity to ride this storm out and we think we're going to come out of this in a very strong manner and I want to make sure we take the steps to do that. So if we have to moderate CapEx more should the price decline continue for a longer period, we'll be in a position to do that. We think we've got the prudent balance now to stay financially strong yet still preserve our long-term growth options and our capability, as Greg said earlier.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Ed Westlake","Good morning and thank you, lots of helpful color. I just want to run through some math on the rig program in the Bakken. I guess if you get down to eight rigs and you're drilling say over 18 rigs per well, next year you'd probably be closer to 150 wells. Obviously you've spoken about some of the drilled but non-completed this year, 210, and obviously this year the exit rate of production is 102 and next year you're 95 to 105, so I guess does that eight rig program implies some decline in 2016, which makes sense because it's all HBP, but I'm just trying to get the math right?","Gregory P. Hill","First of all, as you know we don't really give specific guidance beyond the first year on 2016. But however broadly speaking, Ed, production in the Bakken would remain flat broadly with an eight rig program. So that will give you theory in some direction, but in any case we're going to remain flexible and we'll be prepared to respond accordingly as prices improve, right.","Ed Westlake","Right. And then just a clarification on the costs in the offshore, you obviously highlighted the rigs, are you seeing decline in all service cost related to rigs as well as to the cost of building fabrication topsides?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we are. Again, this cycle is just starting. So again, how low will it go and how fast will it come, it's just too premature to talk about that, but we're certainly seeing the signs of across the board price reductions coming at us.","Ed Westlake","Okay. And then final area, the $1.2 billion of production CapEx this year, and it's very detailed, helpfully detailed in the press release, $300 million in the North Sea for some wells of South Arne and Valhall, $250 million for Tubular Bells, $200 million-ish for EG and then some for Shenzi, another Gulf of Mexico work and then JDA, so you gave us all the data, how much of those wells are I guess linked to reservoir management and how much in say 2016 as you look further out could you just allow the fields to decline or do less activity? I'm trying to get a sense of how much of that $1.2 billion of production CapEx is kind of discretionary and therefore could be influenced by prices.","John P. Rielly","I mean I think it's always discretionary, but I think that the important thing is we're focused on returns. So I mean these wells even at current prices generate great returns. So that's why we're continuing forward, and as long as that's the case we will continue to execute those programs.","Ed Westlake","I presume in 2016, maybe EG and some of the North Sea spend, is there an inventory of those wells to continue that level of activity?","John P. Rielly","Yes, there is, and in EG in particular we just started some new 4D seismic. So we're going to take a drilling pause in 2015 but we know that that new 4D is going to indicate further inventory on a go forward basis for EG.","Ed Westlake","And North Sea, I mean Valhall, yes, obviously the South Arne?","John P. Rielly","Yes, South Arne and Valhall, both have multiyear inventories of drilling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Please proceed.","Paul Cheng","Maybe this is for either Greg or John Rielly, if we are looking at your surface cost, any rough idea that how much of as a percentage that is under-contracted as longer than two years?","John P. Rielly","Surface cost, is that relative to the Bakken?","Paul Cheng","No, I'm talking about overall for the organization. So in other words, I mean that how much is your cost is subject to all that have the opportunity to get reset within the next two years, what is your cost base?","John P. Rielly","Yes, I mean I can't give you a percentage, Paul, but broadly obviously your offshore fleet tends to be contracted for longer periods of time, right. But what I will say is that doesn't mean that there is no opportunity for cost reduction there. We're going to engage with all of our suppliers, are engaging as we speak expecting cost reductions across the board from everyone. So even though it's contracted, that doesn't necessarily mean that we're locked into those rates.","Paul Cheng","And maybe I missed in your earlier prepared remarks, did you provide the first quarter production estimate for Bakken, Utica and Waha, I know that you gave the 2015, but how about the first quarter 2015?","Gregory P. Hill","Sure. So what we're doing for production in the first quarter will be 330,000 barrels a day to 340,000 barrels a day, that's excluding Libya, for the overall portfolio. Bakken is also still \u2013 for the year it was 95 to 105, the first quarter is 95,000 to 105,000 barrels a day.","Paul Cheng","How about Utica and Waha?","John P. Rielly","So for Valhall we gave for the full year, it's 30,000 to 35,000 and it will be the same for the first quarter. Utica will be 15,000 to 20,000 for the full year and it will be a little bit less. So you heard, as Greg said, it's 13,000 barrels in the fourth quarter. So you'll be ramping to that 15,000 to 20,000 throughout the year.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And John, since that you expect to have a tax benefit because you're going to have a few tax laws, should we assume that 100% of that is actually cash or that is more of a book benefit but the cash you still have to pay?","John P. Rielly","No, you should model that essentially as a deferred tax benefit, Paul. I mean we'll have some small cash taxes in several jurisdictions offset by refunds particularly in the UKs where we have our dismantlement, but overall just model that as a deferred tax benefit.","Paul Cheng","Greg, do you have a number that you can share what is the Bakken current cash operating cost and unit DD&A?","John P. Rielly","Paul, as usual, we typically do not provide individual unit cost information. So just overall, Bakken is on the cash cost side, is slightly below our portfolio average, it has been getting better as the production continues to increase there and Greg drives efficiencies in the operations. The DD&A still is higher than the portfolio average, but again, as we book additional reserves with performance as we move through in the Bakken, that DD&A rate has also been coming down and will continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed.","David Heikkinen","As you think about the price scenarios that you're currently running, when would you update your 2013 to 2018 outlook again?","John B. Hess","I'd say as we have a little more visibility on where oil prices stabilize. They are in free fall now, we don't think they are sustainable here, but once the investment programs of not only companies but countries take effect, we think that's going to affect both unconventional and conventional production, that should start to strengthen the market and wherever those prices stably lies remains to be seen, but making a forecast on that now would be foolhardy and predicting when that time we could give new updates also would be foolhardy. We do think during the year as production growth starts to attenuate, prices will start to recover and once we have a little more visibility and confidence in the stability, that's when we would make those updates.","David Heikkinen","Okay. And then just on our own sensitivity and scenarios, we have here over $1 billion of outspend that sustains, is that a reasonable number given your internal scenarios?","John P. Rielly","Again, David, we're just not going to speculate on where oil prices are because as we've been saying, we are going to watch it and be flexible and see where commodity prices are moving and that will affect the pace of investment going forward. So at this point we're just not going to speculate on that number.","David Heikkinen","Okay, worth a shot. And then I guess as you go through the year on drilling and completion cost, we've thought about cost being lower in the back half. Will you just update those quarterly as you actually have the effect of the cost savings that you're negotiating now or when do you think you'll be able to give us some more clarity on how those negotiations are going?","Gregory P. Hill","I think we can update as we go throughout the year. I do want to clarify one thing. Those well costs that I gave in the Bakken, so the D&C of around 6.8, that excludes any significant supply chain reduction. So that was just current cost assuming some efficiencies from lean manufacturing. So there's the opportunity for those costs to go even lower than that in the Bakken in particular.","David Heikkinen","Very good. And then, so the outspend then is really covered by the MLP and you're in a pretty strong position still to move that forward given the sustained production in the Williston, so no changes to that outlook as far as the MLP?","John P. Rielly","No, we are progressing our S-1 filings with the SEC and our preparations remain on track for the transaction in 2015, obviously subject to market conditions, but everything is on track for it.","David Heikkinen","Very good. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Please proceed.","Phillips Johnston","Sort of similar to Ed's question but more on a Company-wide basis, if you look at your overall production guidance for this year ex Libya, it implies that volume should be relatively flat versus the fourth quarter average. Two questions there. First, should we assume the $3.9 billion of CapEx that you plan to spend this year excluding exploration and infrastructure is roughly the level of spending that's required to keep production flat over the next couple of years or is it not that simple?","John P. Rielly","No, it's not that simple, and as you said, as you can see, the overall production is about flat with the fourth quarter, what we do have is, as I mentioned earlier with our production in the first quarter, we have some downtime here coming in the first quarter, right, so that's going to affect the overall average. And then the production numbers, just if you're doing the math, is going to be higher than the fourth quarter numbers as you move through the year. But yes, that kind of math is just difficult to do.","Phillips Johnston","Okay, sure. And then just I guess on that note, looking out into Q4, would you expect Q4 to be similar to Q4 last year or higher or slightly lower?","John P. Rielly","I just hesitate, I mean I'd rather stay with our full-year guidance, because again we just don't want to speculate on what's happening with oil prices on that. If it goes up, it could be a different story and if it goes down there can obviously be a different story as well. So I think we just want to stay with that overall guidance.","Phillips Johnston","Okay. And just to follow-up on the economics in the Bakken, assuming the high-graded wells this year have EURs of 800,000 to 950,000 as you mentioned, what sort of NYMEX breakeven price would you expect those wells to have?","Gregory P. Hill","I think what I can guide you on is that current prices, they exceed our hurdle rate.","Phillips Johnston","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Campbell","In 2014, you were expanding nine and eight well pilots to determine if Middle Bakken and Three Forks zones could support 500 foot lateral spacing. Does this expanded testing continue in 2015 or does it dial back until oil prices rise?","Gregory P. Hill","No, it doesn't dial back, and in fact the results we've seen from the two existing 17 well per DSU pilots are performing in line with expectations. So therefore we're going to expand the number of pilots. We're going to add three more pilots in 2015 aiming for having enough data to make a decision on that development plan by year-end 2015.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. Thank you. You've identified drilling the perfect well offshore Ghana and the players to grow the vehicle after 2020, is this timeline agnostic to oil prices or could FID accelerate if oil prices improve?","John P. Rielly","I think first of all we're obligated to submit a development plan to the Ghanaian government in 2016. So, so far that timeline hasn't changed. Obviously this project like every project is going to be a function of oil price. So I think that deadline could be flexible if oil prices stay low.","Jeffrey Campbell","And as the last question, could you just add a little bit of color on the 2015 exploration effort offshore Guyana, when might you expect the result from the first exploration well and when will the acquisition of additional 3D be completed?","Gregory P. Hill","A lot of the 3D has been shot and it's currently being processed as we speak. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the operator, ExxonMobil affiliate, plans to spud that well in early 2017. Obviously we would have the results during 2017 of that well, and it's cretaceous fan play. Sorry 2015, sorry, not 2017. I was thinking Nova Scotia, I apologize. Guyana is 2015.","Jeffrey Campbell","Right. Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Roger Read","I guess lots of dust has been hit pretty well here, but as we look at the adjustments you're making in your Bakken drilling plan, the number of rigs, and then flexibility to either cut that more if prices go down or ramp it up if prices do recover, can you kind of walk us through what is obviously a greater availability of service capacity but kind of what your flexibility is to go from say eight to six or eight to 10 rigs as we hit the latter part of the year?","John P. Rielly","I think we're trying to maintain flexibility for the reasons you just described given the volatility of oil prices and certainly where it's going. So we can dial up and we can dial back and we're spending a small amount of capital to give us the flexibility to dial up if commodity prices improve, so that means getting permits and pads ready and things like that, but it's a small amount of the budget next year, but that's why we're doing it because we want that ability to dial up as well as dial down, much easier to dial down than it is to dial up, right.","Roger Read","Sure. And then when do you think the M&A market would start to look more active? I mean I know we've had the downturn but everybody is sort of adjusting their plans at this point. Kind of looking back at prior downturns and not asking you to pick a particular property or even region, what's kind of the normal process we should watch here, is the key to acceleration in M&A, is it a latter part of this year, only if oil prices stay down, just kind of how you think about that?","Gregory P. Hill","I wouldn't even want to fathom I guess on your question, but certainly the environment we're in, one would assume that there will be more consolidation and it's yet to unfold.","Roger Read","Alright, good enough for now. Thank you.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Pavel Molchanov","Apologize for my voice. You said, going back to a year ago, that spending would be down in 2015 and of course that was at a time when oil was in the triple digits, so off the 16% reduction in your 2015 budget, how much is specifically driven by commodity prices as opposed to what had already been telegraphed a year ago?","John P. Rielly","It's the significant majority of it. So first remember we were planning on $5.8 billion in this year. We already started making reductions, brought that down to $5.6 billion. So we were going to take a reduction of the $5.8 billion, but the big move down to $4.7 billion is in reaction to the oil price.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. And then are there any FIDs that you have been planning for 2015 that are likely to be delayed or postponed because of the commodity environment?","John P. Rielly","No, there's not. We just didn't have any is the point in 2015.","Pavel Molchanov","No FIDs at all on deck for this year?","John P. Rielly","No.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay, clear enough. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"10819":["Hess Corp.

My name is Vince and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.","Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements.","These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","As you know, Hess Midstream Partners LP completed its initial public offering earlier this month. Please be aware that even though the IPO was closed, we are still restricted by securities laws and what we can say about Hess Midstream Partners at this time. As such, our remarks today about Hess Midstream Partners will be very limited. We expect that Hess Midstream Partners will file its 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 in May.","Now, as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will review the progress we are making in executing our strategy as well as highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and John Rielly will then review our financial results.","Our company has had more than a decade of visible production growth secured with an expanding resource base, declining operating and development costs and strong leverage to oil prices, all of which should improve our financial returns and create significant value for our shareholders. Production growth, which is set to resume beginning in the second half of 2017 is underpinned by the Bakken, the North Malay Basin and Stampede developments, and offshore Guyana, where we have participated in one of the industry's largest oil discoveries in the past 10 years.","Key to funding these growth projects is a strong balance sheet. With $2.7 billion of cash and total liquidity of $7.2 billion as of March 31, our financial position remained strong. To provide insurance for oil price uncertainty and our increasing activity levels, we have hedged 80,000 barrels of oil per day for the balance of 2017, utilizing a put-call strategy that provides a floor of $50 per barrel for WTI and $55 per barrel for Brent, while retaining $20 per barrel upside from those price levels.","To unlock additional value, earlier this month, we successfully completed the initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP. The transaction, priced at $23 per unit, well above the indicated pricing range of $19 to $21 per unit. As a result of strong demand, the transaction was upside by 20%, resulting in net proceeds of $350 million to our Bakken Midstream joint venture, with $175 million attributable to Hess Corporation.","In addition, the MLP provides another attractive long-term funding vehicle for our company. With regard to our growth projects, in the Bakken, where we have a premier acreage position in the core of the play, we added a third operated rig in March, a fourth rig in April, and plan to add two additional rigs in the fourth quarter.","In Malaysia, the Hess operated North Malay Basin development, in which Hess has a 50% interest, is expected to come online in the third quarter, and add in excess of 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, becoming a long-term cash generator for the company.","In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Hess operated Stampede development, in which Hess has a 25% interest, is on track to start up in the first half of 2018, after which production is expected to ramp up to 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Offshore Guyana, in March our partner, ExxonMobil, announced another discovery at the Snoek prospect on the Stabroek Block. This oil discovery is additive to those at Liza, Liza deep, and Payara, which have an estimated recoverable resource range of between 1.4 billion barrels and 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Also, we see numerous additional exploration prospects on the block that collectively offer multi-billion barrels of un-risked upside potential.","Planning for the development of the greater Liza area is underway, with final investment decision and project sanction of the first phase expected mid-year 2017, and first production by 2020. The development concept for Liza Phase I is based on a floating production, storage and offloading vessel or FPSO that will process approximately 120,000 barrels of oil per day, produced from two subsea drill centers. Liza Phase I offers attractive project economics down to $40 Brent flat.","The greater Liza development has the potential to be transformational for our company and positions us for more than a decade of material reserve and production growth, and improving financial returns and cost metrics.","Now, with regard to our financial results, in the first quarter of 2017, we posted a net loss of $324 million, or $1.07 per share, compared to a net loss of $509 million or $1.72 per share in the year ago quarter. Compared to 2016, our first quarter financial results were positively impacted by higher crude oil selling prices and lower operating costs and exploration expenses, which more than offset the change in deferred income taxes and lower production volumes.","With activity increasing in 2017, our focus is on execution in terms of delivering production, progressing our offshore developments, and continuing to drive cost reductions and efficiencies. First quarter production was above our guidance range, averaging 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, driven by strong performance across our portfolio. Bakken production averaged 99,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, above the high end of our guidance range, despite challenging weather conditions during the quarter.","In summary, with our strong financial and liquidity position, oil leverage portfolio and exciting growth opportunities, we believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong cash flow growth and compelling long-term value for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2017 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production. In the first quarter, we averaged 307,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, which was above our guidance range of 290,000 to 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on the same basis, reflecting strong operating performance across our portfolio.","Regarding second quarter guidance, we expect net production to average between 275,000 and 285,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, which is a 5,000 barrel per day increase versus our previous guidance. The second quarter is lower than the first quarter, primarily due to planned seasonal maintenance in the offshore. However, the third quarter will be a major inflection point for production, as positive momentum returns to our portfolio with North Malay Basin coming on-stream and Bakken production ramping as a result of the increased rig count.","Our full year 2017 production guidance remains 300,000 to 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but as usual, we will provide an update to full year guidance on our mid-year call in July.","Turning to onshore operations for the quarter. In the Bakken, we recovered quickly from the temporary operational impacts of extreme weather conditions over December and January to average 99,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, beating our guidance of 90,000 to 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, while bringing on line some of the highest IP rate wells that we have seen to-date.","We continue to see outstanding results in the Bakken, driven by high well availability and improved well performance from our 50-stage completions. We are seeing a consistent 15% to 20% increase in well productivity as a result of the shift to 50-stage completions from our previous 35-stage standard design.","As discussed on our last call, we continue to trial higher stage counts and higher proppant loadings. While still early days, we're encouraged by initial results. We will gather additional production and cost data from these tests in the coming months and will provide an update on our July call.","In March, as John noted, we added a third operated rig in the Bakken and April a fourth, and we currently plan to add two further rigs in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we drilled 11 wells and brought 8 new wells online. This compares to the year ago quarter when we drilled 19 wells and brought 31 wells online. In 2017, we still expect to drill approximately 80 wells and bring approximately 75 new wells online.","For the second quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average approximately 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In Libya, we were able to complete a lifting in March and the asset contributed net production of 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. Despite the resumption of production, the political situation in the country remains uncertain and therefore we continue to exclude Libya from our forecasts.","Moving to offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. In the second quarter, a 34-day shutdown is planned for the Conger Field and a 44-day shutdown is planned for the Llano Field, which should result in our Gulf of Mexico production averaging between 50,000 and 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter.","In Norway at the Aker BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, drilling resumed in March from the platform rig and we expect the first well to come online in the fourth quarter. A further 11-day shutdown is planned in the second quarter at the Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea. Net production from Equatorial Guinea averaged 31,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter.","For offshore developments, at North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, we are now in the final phases of the full field development. The central processing platform was successfully installed in March, and hookup and commissioning is progressing according to plan.","The three remote wellhead platforms have been hooked up and commissioned. The FSO is scheduled to sail out during the second quarter. And all of the 14 wells planned for full field startup have been completed. Once full-field development is completed in the third quarter of this year, we expect net production to build fairly rapidly to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day, becoming a significant long-term cash generator for the company.","At the Stampede development in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully completed the first production well and have spud a second well. Sail-away of the tension leg platform and the commencement of installation are scheduled for the second quarter. First oil remains on schedule for the first half of 2018.","Now, turning to Guyana, in the Stabroek Block, in which Hess holds a 30% interest, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited announced that the Snoek well, located approximately 5 miles southeast of the Liza-1 discovery well resulted in another oil discovery. The well encountered more than 82 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. The rig has now moved back to Liza to drill the Liza-4 appraisal well, which spud on March 31. This well is designed to further evaluate the significant Liza oil discovery and help define the full-field development plans.","ExxonMobil estimates gross recoverable resources for the greater Liza area to be in the range of 1.4 billion to 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which is expected to support multiple phases of development. The Liza-4 and Payara-2 appraisal wells will evaluate the high side of this range. We plan to continue to progress exploration of the wider Stabroek Block in 2017 and 2018, on which we see numerous remaining prospects across multiple play types, representing multi-billion barrel un-risked upside potential.","We expect to sanction the first phase of development of the Liza field around mid-year. This development is expected to be configured for gross production of approximately 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with first oil expected by 2020, and will generate attractive project economics down to $40 Brent flat.","In closing, we have once again demonstrated excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. With an attractive mix of captured short and long cycle opportunities and top quartile operating capabilities, we are well positioned for a decade of value driven reserve and production growth.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today I will compare results from the first quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2016. In the first quarter of 2017, we reported a net loss of $324 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $305 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to E&P, E&P incurred a net loss of $233 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to an adjusted net loss of $256 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.","The changes in the after-tax components of E&P results between the first quarter of 2017 and adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2016 were as follows. Higher realized selling prices improved results by $34 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $14 million. Lower cash operating costs improved results by $44 million. Lower exploration expenses improved results by $19 million. Lower Midstream tariffs improved results by $15 million. Changes in effective tax rate reduced results by $89 million. All other items net improved results by $14 million for an overall improvement in first quarter results of $23 million.","The E&P effective income tax rate was a benefit of 13% for the first quarter of 2017 compared with the benefit of 43% in the fourth quarter, excluding items affecting comparability and Libyan operations. The lower effective tax rate in the first quarter is due to not recognizing a deferred tax benefit on operating losses in the U.S., Denmark and Malaysia as previously discussed when we provided 2017 guidance. For the first quarter, our E&P sales volumes were under-lifted compared with production by approximately 1.4 million barrels, which did not have a material impact on our results.","Turning to Midstream. In April 2017, the Corporation and its partners successfully completed the IPO of Hess Midstream Partners and we received our net share of proceeds totaling $175 million. The IPO transaction had no impact on the Midstream segment first quarter results, but has been incorporated into our updated guidance for the remainder of the year.","In addition, as we previously announced, commencing January 1, 2017, our Midstream segment now includes the Corporation's interest in a Permian Basin gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets, and our wholly-owned water handling assets in North Dakota. We have recast all prior period financial information to include these assets and the results as part of the Midstream segment.","In our first quarter supplemental earnings information presentation located on the Hess website, we have provided quarterly consolidating income statements for 2016, recast to reflect the transfer of these assets from E&P to Midstream.","In the first quarter of 2017, the Midstream segment had net income of $18 million compared to adjusted net income of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which included the recognition of a full year of deferred minimum volume deficiency payments earned at year-end 2016. EBITDA for the Midstream before the non-controlling interest amounted to $94 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $102 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $109 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to adjusted after-tax corporate and interest expenses of $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The first quarter results reflect not recognizing a deferred tax benefit on operating losses.","Turning to first quarter cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $443 million. The net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $94 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $390 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $100 million. Net repayments of debt were $21 million. Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $92 million. All other items resulted in an increase in cash of $8 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the first of $46 million.","The sale proceeds received in the quarter resulted from the sale of approximately 8,500 non-core net acres in the West Goliath area of the Bakken, which at the time was producing approximately 240 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Turning to cash and liquidity. Excluding the Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, total liquidity of $7.2 billion, including available committed credit facilities, and debt of $6.54 billion at March 31, 2017.","Now turning to guidance. First for E&P. In the first quarter, our E&P cash costs were $14.15 per barrel, which beat guidance on strong production performance and cost management. For the second quarter, E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $15.50 to $16.50 per barrel, reflecting the lower second quarter production guidance and higher planned offshore facility maintenance costs, with full year guidance of $15 to $16 per barrel remaining unchanged.","DD&A per barrel in the second quarter is forecast to be $25 to $26 with full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $24 to $25 per barrel. The resulting total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be $40.50 to $42.50 per barrel in the second quarter, and $39 to $41 per barrel for the full year.","Exploration expenses excluding dry holes are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million in the second quarter, with full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $250 million to $270 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million in the second quarter, and $520 million to $550 million for the full year, which is unchanged from prior guidance.","The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 10% to 14% for the second quarter. For the full year 2017, we now expect a benefit in the range of 12% to 16%, down from original guidance of 17% to 21% due to a change in mix of operating results.","Turning to Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million in the second quarter. Midstream net income attributable to Hess for the full year is projected to be $65 million to $85 million, which is down from original guidance of $70 million to $90 million. The change reflects the increased non-controlling interest from the MLP as a result of the IPO.","Turning to corporate, for the second quarter of 2017, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million, and interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million. Full year guidance remains unchanged at $140 million to $150 million for corporate expenses, and $295 million to $305 million for interest expense.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I've got two questions, if I may, and the first one is on the capital guidance or the capital for the year. It looks like your first quarter spending run rate is a little bit light relative to the annualized rate. Is that just a pending issue or are you running below what your expectations are? And I've got a follow-up in Guyana, please.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Doug, right now, we're forecasting our capital spending in Q2 through Q4 to be higher than what you're seeing in Q1 and there is a couple of reasons. I mean, as you know, we're going to be ramping up rigs in the Bakken from two rigs at the beginning of the year to six at year end. Now, we are also forecasting an increased spend mid-year as we get closer to the North Malay Basin startup in Q3. So, as you've seen, cost and capital have been performing well here in the first quarter. So we'll continue to monitor what we're doing through the year and as usual, we'll update our guidance in mid-year. But, right now, our guidance remains $2.25 billion.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that. My second question is on Guyana. There is a couple of thesis to it if you can bear with me for a minute. So my understanding is you've signed that joint interest agreement with Exxon covering the broader Guyana-Suriname Basin. Can you walk us through what that means in terms of your potential entry into additional blocks?","And the second part of my question, however, is more to do with the timing of sanction. There still seems to be some concern over the potential for a substantial step-up in your spending as you moved into development phase. Can you walk us through what your latest thinking is in terms of flexibility to fund your share and whether you are in fact moving forward with a leased FPSO, because obviously there are different capital ramifications? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","All right. Doug, I'll start with your last question on the capital spend associated with the early production system and our flexibility to finance it. And I guess the first thing I should say is, we are working with the operator, and we are looking to sanction the early production system for Liza around midyear. So at that point everybody can see the numbers associated with that early production system.","Now, we expect the Guyana development to be phased, so with the cost spread out over a number of years, and for initial phases of development to fund future phases as Greg talked about earlier. Now, as you said, at this point in our discussions with the operator, we are looking at leasing the FPSO which will reduce our upfront spend for the development. And then again going to our flexibility, these increase in expenditures in Guyana coincide with the startup of North Malay Basin and Stampede, which become cash generator starting in 2018.","And the last thing I would like to remind everybody, we are sitting with $2.7 billion of cash right now in our balance sheet and we have a high leveraged oil prices. So, as you know, every $1 increase in oil price adds approximately $70 million of after-tax cash flow to our portfolio. So we are poised to benefit from any increase in oil prices. So, our flexibility is there to fund the Guyana development. And then, Greg?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. So, Doug, on your first question, first of all, there's been nothing signed yet. However, Exxon and Hess are, given our understanding of obviously the greater Guyana basin, I'll call it, we are looking for other potential opportunities to expand our footprint. I really can't say much beyond that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answers guys. John, if I may, just a quick follow-up. On the flexibility issue, $700 million is the capital allocated to Stampede and North Malay this year. Is that right?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So, it was $700 million last year, and I think, hang on, for this year for Stampede and for North Malay Basin, we had $275 million budgeted for North Malay Basin and $425 million. So, yes, you are correct. That $700 million of capital associated with those two assets. So, in 2018, the capital will go down for those assets combined, plus cash flow will go up.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes. Good morning. First question on the Bakken, and congrats on that productivity improvement and beating the forecasts. Maybe an update on the decline rate of the base, because when I look at how many wells you're going to complete and the improvements in the productivity, it seems as if the production guidance you're giving is a little bit low, maybe it's just timing. But interested in the decline rate on the base production at this point.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Ed, I think, as you know, that's a very complicated question because you have a whole number of wells that are in the base at a very low decline rate. You have wells that have recently come on that are in either their first or their second year of decline. So, I think any \u2013 as you kind of look at production in the Bakken this year, it's purely a function of timing of when wells are coming on. As we mentioned in our opening remarks, that positive momentum really picks up in the second half of the year. As we put that third and fourth rig to work and start completing wells, that momentum really picks up. So that's really what's driving it. I always hate to answer the decline question because it's extremely complicated.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Second question is then on costs. I mean, you did come in below guidance and obviously, with maintenance, it will go up a bit in the second quarter. But presumably, when that maintenance is completed later in the year, then some of the cost benefits you've seen may come back down. Is it sort of an inflation driver that means you haven't lowered your full year cash cost guidance at this point?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","No. I'd say it's more \u2013 it's basically more of our practice right now. It's early in the year. We've had good cost performance and good production performance, so it was both of those combined on how we came in under our cash cost guidance. In the second quarter, as you said, we will have the higher maintenance cost and a higher cash cost. So, as you move to the third quarter, yes, the cost reduction efforts that we have been \u2013 that had been ongoing, and we did some further cost reductions at the end of 2016, will come back into the portfolio.","The other thing that will happen is that North Malay Basin starts up in the third quarter. And that from our portfolio will be very accretive to cash cost because that is a low cash cost asset. So as North Malay Basin continues to ramp up in the third and then into the fourth quarter, that will help our cash costs as well. So, what we'll see is by our next earnings call, right, we'll have gotten through the maintenance season, we'll see where North Malay Basin is from the startup standpoint on timing and then we'll update our cash cost guidance at that point.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","I look forward to that update. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning, all. Just the specifics, firstly, on your volume guidance. Can you just walk us through how we get to the fourth quarter guidance which is specified to be 330,000 to 340,000 barrels a day oil equivalent, but then within oil, we're interested in the 182,000 to 186,000 barrels a day. It seems low relative to where you are today. Could you just bridge us through why it's not higher? This is for 2017 obviously. Thanks.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, Paul, I think as we said in our opening remarks, we did update guidance for the second quarter, so we're up about 5,000 barrels a day versus our previous guidance. And we will, of course, mid-year give a revised update, or a new update, I should say, on what the guidance is for the year and for the remaining quarters. The reason we haven't updated our guidance yet is because, again, North Malay Basin, we just want to have some greater certainty on exactly when that's going to start up. So once that's clear, which will be in the second quarter, the exact date of startup, then we'll be in a better position to update guidance for the rest of the year.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","You hit the kind of area that we were thinking was the main reason. Is there anything else other than North Malay Basin that would be contributing or detracting from the outlook?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So that's the major uncertainty. Great. And then if I could just ask a strategy question. With Guyana being what it is, is there any future for any other wildcat exploration? Is there any need for any other wildcat exploration for you guys in the future or can we say that that's the end of it really globally and Guyana plus Bakken is everything you need? Thanks.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah, no. Paul, we're going to be very selective and focused and capital disciplined in our efforts in exploration. As you know, our strategy has been and continues to be early access to material resource opportunities with running room focused on oil, Atlantic Margin, at low cost. And obviously that strategy is working in Guyana and Suriname Basin. A great example where Liza, Payara, the greater Liza area, already world-class in their own right, will generate very attractive returns down to $40 Brent flat, competitive with any unconventional play, and in our opinion even better. So, it's all about focusing on returns and creating long-term value that I think is going to distinguish our company for many years to come.","Beyond that, we still see in the Guyana-Suriname Basin further un-risked multi-billion potential and that's where the majority of our efforts is going to be. Yes, there will be some wildcatting, but it will be within our framework of capital discipline and keeping a tight rein on our spending. So, we will spend some money outside of that, but the majority of our exploration efforts will be focused on Guyana.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you, John.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Morris of Citi. Your line is open.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. On the Bakken production that exceeded your guidance, you mentioned that you had some of the highest IP rate wells to-date. Is that performance \u2013 is there something beyond just the uplift from the 50-stage completions that's driving that outperformance and the strong well results there?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. I think it's really, the uplift is a 50-stage completions plus we're drilling in the Keene area, which is truly the core of the core of the Bakken. You noticed that our performance was up in fourth quarter of last year. That strong performance continued into the first quarter of this year and it's really a function of where we're drilling on the 50-stage fracs. Those were the two factors for both quarters.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And is the Keene area where you plan to drill and bring on most of the 80 wells and 75 wells for the year?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I mean a good majority of the wells will be in that section. As we increase the rig count, we'll stay in the core, but we'll be moving out of the core of the core which is really the Keene. So, our whole drilling program will be in the core this year, but not all of it will be in the keen area, simply because of some of the operational challenges of operating that many rigs in the same place, a lot of SIMOPS issues.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And finally there, where do you stand on maybe accelerating the rig adds (38:09)? You'd commented last quarter that depending on cash on the oil price that you could accelerate a fifth rig or sixth rig in Q3 versus Q4. Is that still dependent on what cash flow and oil prices are to do that?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. I think our current plan is still to add that rig in the fourth \u2013 add those two rigs in the fourth quarter.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just separately my follow-on is, in Guyana and from your comments that you've made so far with the 120,000 barrel per day FPSO, it appears that you will develop Payara and Snoek as part of that FPSO development with Liza, would that be the correct assumption?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, I think the assumption would be that there will be a greater Liza area development. So, as you get into full-field development, consider Liza and Payara as kind of one, Snoek yet to be determined, but it will most likely be tied into that greater Liza Payara development plan. I did want to correct one of my remarks in the opening. I said the Phase I is 120,000 barrel equivalents, it's actually 120,000 barrels of oil per day facility. So I wanted to correct that on the call.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. Nice quarter.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Following up on a couple of the earlier questions with regards to the Bakken. You talked about in the press release some weather delays. Could you quantify what that was and then add a little bit more color on the \u2013 and then how, if those weather delays have gone away, that still leaves flat production sequentially or flattish production sequentially in the second quarter versus further step up?","And then, I think, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are planning an update in July on what these completions and the effectiveness they are having. But, can you give us your hypothesis for the 50-stage completions and what that does for EURs and recovery rates?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, I think, let me answer your last question first. So the 50-stage completions, we quote now, IP90 rates versus IP30, because we just think that's a better reflection of \u2013 that takes in the operational impacts. So, with the IP90s now, we're showing, in this quarter it was close to 800, I think, it was 793. And then the EURs \u2013 the corresponding EURs are in the range of about 1 million barrels. So that's on the 50-stage fracs.","As I mentioned, in the first quarter, we're doing a lot of experimentation with higher stage counts. So we've got a number of 60-stage completions in the ground now. So we're actually considering did we just move to 60-stage. We want to get a few more on the ground to make sure they are reliable, make sure we understand the production performance of those. So that will be one thing that we'll update in July as we said. We've also got a few wells with higher proppant loadings. We plan to do more of those in the second quarter. So, again, all of this is a bit influx, which is why I said we will update all of that EURs, IPs, well costs, we'll update everything in our second quarter mid-year update as always.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then \u2013 go ahead, I'm sorry.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","In regard to your first quarter \u2013 yeah, sorry, your question on the first quarter, the weather really hit us in January. So we fully recovered from that in February and March, and as we mentioned, the current forecast for Bakken in the second quarter is about 100,000 barrels a day. So up a bit from the first quarter, and then you really begin to see, as we mentioned, the production momentum from the Bakken really kicking in in the third quarter and fourth quarter as you get the impact of that third and fourth rig being able to start completing wells in the last half of the year. So that's why the first and second is relatively flat, because you're drilling, you're not completing those wells from the third and the fourth rig.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And my follow-up is with regards to actually the completion side. As you do plan to ramp up, then especially if you are increasing the stage counts of some of those completions, can you talk about what you are seeing in the Bakken in terms of both the cost on a pressure pumping side, and then also the availability from a people perspective and a sand and sand logistics perspective?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I think so. Certainly, on the \u2013 again, we'll update this mid-year, but the results of the higher stage counts, and although a few \u2013 only a few wells, the higher proppant loadings are encouraging. So that's good.","Now in regards to your second question, we are seeing some upward pressure on costs in the Bakken in the completion space as you said. We've taken a lot of steps to really minimize that. Several things that we've done. We're locking in the rig rates. We're pre-purchasing sand and we're putting in place longer-term contracts both on the rigs and also on the pumping side. So these steps coupled with our Lean manufacturing approach where we still make operational improvements give us confidence that we'll be able to deliver our 2017 program with minimal inflation. There may be some, but we're really trying to minimize that as much as possible.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO. Your line is open.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning. I believe there is a tender for a second rig in Guyana and I was wondering if you could discuss any plans, whether development or exploration and timing for the second rig?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Can't really discuss timing yet, because it's dependent obviously upon sanction, Phase I, which we hope to do in midyear. The current thinking is that we will probably have one rig dedicated to do exploration\/appraisal and then as you move into development on Phase I, then you'll probably have a rig dedicated for drilling the development wells of Phase I. So that's the current thinking but again, we haven't made final decisions on when that second rig comes into the play, that's up to the operator.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then, when you do sanction Liza Phase I this summer, would you anticipate that incremental disclosure would be limited to Phase I or could you also provide some color on Phase II or a potential multi-phased development?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","I think you should assume for now that it will be primarily just a Phase I development disclosure because, again, this is going to be a large development, multi-FPSOs that are phased over a number of years. So that's going to require a lot of planning and thinking and all that kind of stuff and, as to how you sequence all that. So I think you could expect later color on that. So the first disclosure will be primarily on Phase I.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then you have the Penn State well that's expected to be brought online in the third quarter, and I was just wondering if you could talk to the opportunity set in the Gulf of Mexico for a similar subsea tieback wells, such as this, which I believe is expected to IP around 10,000 barrels a day?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, that's a good question. I think we see a number of similar opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico. And I think as we've said in the past, when we would add a rig in the Gulf of Mexico is really going to be a function of the oil price, as you see more strength in the oil price. We will bring that into consideration because I think as we've said before, you're going to want more strength in the offshore before you do that because typically you'll commit to a very expensive rig, although a lot cheaper now, but you'll commit to a rig and so you want to have confidence that you have a pretty good oil price outlook before you commit to that very high cost rig line and associated equipment, different than the onshore.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, will you be able to share any estimate that for the early production system, how much reserve that you guys expect that? Is it, say, 500 million or 600 million barrel that you will be able to extract from that and what the development cost may look like?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Paul, I think, we will share as much as we can when we sanction Phase I, so hopefully mid-year.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And you guys is not at a position that you will be able to share about the new discovery in Guyana what may be the estimated size?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. Because remember, we just finished that well in March. So there is still a lot of evaluation going on with the Snoek prospect.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Maybe this is for John Rielly. John, when looking at the international unit OpEx cost, from the fourth to the first quarter, you had really dropped a lot and your production actually internationally have gone down. So I am a little bit, unclear to me why the unit costs have come down that much? Is it just purely as simple as that because you're under lift so that the \u2013 but your production is higher, so that means that the causes only reflect what is being lifted. Is there any other explanation that you can give us?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So the cost reduction doesn't have anything to do with the under lift. In the fourth quarter when you're looking at those numbers, if you remember, we had some non-recurring special items and one of them was an inventory write-off, so on the international side we had approximately a $30 million pre-tax inventory write-off that's in those operating cost in the fourth quarter. So you had that special. Then even with that you can see, even across our U.S. and international though we have reduced cost throughout the portfolio, and are continuing to focus on that. Obviously, good production performance helps, but we did go through a lot of cost reduction efforts through 2016 and it bore some fruit as you can see in the first quarter.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, I mean, just for the inventory write-down, I mean, your fourth quarter will drop to, say, call it $15.50, but you're still about $2 lower in the first quarter. So is that is all just by normal course of your cost reduction (49:48)?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yes, correct, it's normal cost execution. Correct. It's just normal execution, good performance across the portfolio.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just curious there, I mean, in Permian, since that you really have no production there, why don't we just sell Permian into your MLP or sell to some other people, why keep the Permian gas plant under Hess today?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Okay. So, just to start with the Permian, so in the first quarter, it's still producing 8,000 barrels a day, so it's not an absolute material amount, but it's producing 8,000 barrels a day, and it's generating cash flow for the company. Now, what we have done is from an MLP standpoint, it's the gas plant and the CO2 where you don't take the E&P type commodity price exposure to put it in the Midstream. So we are, as I talked about moving the Permian gas plant and the CO2 asset into our Midstream segment, and that happened on January 1, and we did recast the prior 2016. So we have taken steps. Now, we still have that 100%. It has not been dropped into our joint venture with GIP, but it's something that's under discussion.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Final one for Greg. At six rigs, if we assume that you exit from there and stay there, what kind of Bakken target production growth rate from 2018 to 2020 we could expect? And also that, given the wide (51:26) commodity prices, and let's assume somewhere between $60 million to $70 million (51:31), what is the optimal Bakken petrol production rate that you guys is currently foreseeing?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Paul, so we'll give guidance obviously as we approach 2018. The reason I don't want to be more specific than that is because, remember, our completion design is in flux, right? So what the future completion design will be, will be a large factor in saying what the growth rate at the Bakken will be with six rigs. What we do know right now is it takes about 3.25 rigs to hold the Bakken flat at this roughly 100,000 barrels a day, let's call it. So, clearly, any rigs above that is going to be growth, but depending on the completion design, the rate of that growth might vary. So we'll give guidance as we kind of complete these completion trials and determine what the completion design is on a go forward basis.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Your line is open.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks very much for taking the call. I wanted to follow up on the Bakken and the pilot programs you have planned this year. But to what extent are better well results from your pilot programs, the 60-stage fracs, the higher proppant loadings factored into your 4Q 2017 Bakken production guidance? And would there be any upside to that guidance if you do begin to see an improvement in your IP rates?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","So, none of that's built into the guidance yet. And that's why we hope to update things in the middle of the year. Given the early results of the 60-stage wells, and even though few, but we'll do more in the second quarter of the higher proppant loading, the bias will be for that guidance to go up.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","Got it. That's helpful. And then, the oil cut in the Bakken looks like it also increased pretty considerably to its highest level since 2015 I believe. But can you talk about what the driver may have been of that higher oil cut this quarter? And is that higher level sustainable?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, it's not. So the \u2013 it's purely operational. If you look at the well GORs, it's about 15.50% (53:57). That has stayed constant for years and will stay constant in the future. It was purely operational, related to the weather in the first quarter where we had some compressor downtime, so you threw a lot more gas to flare than what you normally would have in normal operation. So that's what's causing that aberration in higher oil versus gas this quarter.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Great. And then last one from me. I just wanted to circle back to the 1Q just overall production outperformance. But obviously you beat expectations. The Bakken was very strong. Where else did you outperform relative to the internal plan? The Gulf of Mexico looked good relative to our estimates, was that a driver? And on that note, can you give us an update on how Tubular Bells is performing and what expectations are for that asset this year?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","So, you're right. The Bakken was up about 7,000 barrels a day versus what we thought. The other 5,000 was really kind of spread out across the portfolio. But you're right, it was primarily the Gulf of Mexico that came in performing better.","If you look at TBells, as we said in our January call, in Q1 we increased water injection and began slowly bringing on our fifth producer and also that well that we worked over right at the end of last year. So we're bringing those wells on very slowly and as a result, production continues to increase on Tubular Bells.","So while those trends are encouraging, what I said last quarter is I really want to see some constant stable production on Tubular Bells before I forecast what it's going to do. So I'd like to see a few more months of stable production and injection data before we issue kind of a new full year forecast for TBells. But quarter-on-quarter, TBells is up about 4,000 barrels a day.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","And so what did that bring with the 1Q 2017 average to for TBells if you can share it?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","The first quarter was \u2013 average for TBells is about 13,000. Currently, we are kind of in the range of 18,000 to 19,000 barrels a day on TBells. So it continues to ramp. We're taking it very slowly, very cautiously and also watching hopefully the impact of water injection as well.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Hi, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe first a strategic question. I mean, as Liza moves into development and Guyana through the exploration phase, how do you think about managing your position size relative to the total portfolio, meaning how, if or when do you consider monetizing or selling down any interest to pull forward the significant value there?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. We see exceptional value and returns in our position in Guyana and a lot more upside in some of the future drilling that we have there, so we're very happy with our position. If it makes sense to pull value forward, we might look at some others levers in the portfolio, because one of the best returns I think in the industry is going to be the investment we make in Guyana, the fact that it has very attractive economics with what we already have captured in the greater Liza area down to $40 Brent flat and a lot of upside potential. So there is a lot more running room there and it's going to be very low cost on the cost curve, so we think it's going to have exceptional return. So, we want light to shine on that and wouldn't want to be premature in terms of anything else.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's fair. John, maybe a follow-up to the 2017 hedges renew. I know that's been an variable program over time. Is there any change in your commodity outlook or hedging strategy given the significant investment potential within the portfolio and any comments there?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Obviously with the uncertainty about oil prices, we do think we're entering a new chapter of oil prices where they will start going up to attract more investment in the business, but we certainly think we're still in a volatile period and with the increase in activity levels that we have, we just thought having some price insurance for this year would be a wise idea.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And maybe lastly if I could. Just following up on the Bakken beat, I mean, it looks like the IP90 well performance was in line Q-over-Q from the ops report that was just filed. And so is the variance of the beat largely as you look at a completion timing in December and 1Q, I mean, given that you beat the Bakken with just eight wells TIL'd (59:01) in the quarter?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I think it was a combination of things. It was a combination of a little bit better well performance than planned in our 50-stage fracs. The second factor was we recovered from the weather much quicker, much more rapidly than we anticipated. So those were the few big things, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. So your plan is below the current performance and from at least IP90 basis that we see in the Bakken from 4Q and now into 1Q, is that right?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","It was in the first Q, so the wells did a little better than we thought in the first Q. Yeah. We only got eight wells on remember, so.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. First question on timing. When do you expect the third and sixth rigs coming to the Bakken to show a positive production effect in 2018?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, it will be late in the fourth quarter. So you really won't see any impact of those rigs in 2017, it will be primarily in 2018.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Right. And that was what I was wondering. When do you think that will start to show up in 2018?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Second quarter.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. Touching on John's remarks earlier about future wildcatting. I was just wondering, do you consider drilling offshore Nova Scotia in 2018 wildcatting to some extent?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yes. That would be one of the wells that we would have a commitment on, but again, the majority of our exploration program is going to be very focused and the majority of the dollars are going to go to Guyana.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, fair enough. And my last question. Utica Shale, Appalachian NGL prices have improved significantly. Industry peers are attempting an enhanced rates of return by drilling ultra long laterals, and this is also showing up in the Southwest PA Marcellus. I was just wondering if you could update your thinking on the Utica? Are you watching this long lateral trend? What needs to happen in the commodities to get rig into the Utica again?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. I think you're right. I think we are watching long laterals. Obviously, we are watching the margins change and the gas prices go higher. There are no plans for us right now to bring any rigs back into the Utica in 2017. But obviously, as those trends improve, we'll begin to evaluate do we bring a rig back in the Utica.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that you're kind of drilling in the core of the core Keene area now and I was just kind of curious, out of the 2,850 future locations, how many locations you'd assign to this area if you could?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, I think maybe a better way to answer it without being specific. Keene, we have several hundred wells that can deliver the kind of performance that we're seeing in the last couple of quarters.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","So, you've got well more than the 2017 drilling program that carries into 2018, and maybe even a little longer (1:02:21).","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","We do, and the only \u2013 again, the only reason you wouldn't concentrate all of your drilling there is simply because of SIMOPS issues. You just can't have that many rigs concentrated in one place like that.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","That's really helpful. Okay. That was it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line..","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just two quick ones about the Liza FID. Once you reach FID, you're presumably going to be booking some reserves. Do you have a sense of what you'll be able to book upfront in 2017?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, when we take sanction, we'll obviously give you a lot more color on that.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So still figuring that out. And then the timing of reaching FID, is there any relevance in the fact that there're still a border dispute involving Venezuela? Is that going to be influencing the timing at all, the political landscape?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","No.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Your line is open.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Yeah. One for Greg regarding Guyana. You talked about good returns with $40 flat pricing. Obviously, rig costs are cheaper, but how are cycle times changing for the deepwater as well as other cost like completion for the deepwater, because the Street's very fixated these days on (1:04:06) shale earnings, but what's happening in the deepwater that you could pinpoint?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, I think obviously specific to Guyana, it's unique in itself because it's shallower wells, these are only about 13,000 feet to 15,000 feet below the mud line, so it's a bit of a unique province in itself. I think the broader question around industry and deepwater, obviously the costs are coming down still, particularly in the shipyard area, where shipyards now are half full and projected to be even less than that. Next year, still some softness in the offshore rig market. So, the price trends are awesome in the deepwater and that bodes well obviously for our Guyana development, both of those dimensions. Also, there is a broad effort in the industry and very significant effort in Hess around standardization. So I think all of that is going to significantly improve the cycle time. You have shipyards focused on much of your projects. You will have industry focused on standardization. So all of that is really collapsing the cycle time of when you can bring these things on, which is good.","John Herrlin - Societe Generale","Great. Thanks. That's it from me.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"10969":["Hess Corp.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.","Thank you. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will provide a strategy update, Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results.","We delivered another strong quarter of execution with higher production and guidance and lower unit costs and guidance while keeping capital and exploratory expenditures flat with guidance for the year and generating a profit for the quarter. We continue to execute our strategy to deliver capital-efficient growth in our resources and production, investing in the highest return projects to move down the cost curve and be profitable in a lower price environment, with increasing cash generation and returns to shareholders.","Fundamental to this strategy is our focused high-return portfolio with Guyana and the Bakken as our growth engines where we plan to invest about 75% of our capital and exploratory expenditures over the next five years, and Malaysia and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as our cash engines. Pro forma for our asset sales, our high-graded portfolio is on track to deliver capital-efficient compound annual production growth of approximately 10% through 2023 while driving cash unit costs down approximately 30% to less than $10 per BOE over the same period. The combination of growth and margin expansion is expected to drive compound annual cash flow growth of approximately 25% through 2023 at a $60 per barrel Brent oil price.","An integral part of our strategy is maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position to ensure we have the financial capacity to fund our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our position in Guyana is truly world-class in every respect and transformational for our company. As of June, gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator have grown and are estimated to be more than 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent with multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential.","In late August, we announced a ninth oil discovery on the block at the Hammerhead-1 well located approximately 13 miles southwest of the Liza-1 well, proving a new play concept for potential development. This month, a second exploration vessel, the Noble Tom Madden, arrived to accelerate exploration and appraisal activities on the block, starting with the Pluma prospect located 17 miles south of Turbot where we expect to spud in early November.","The Liza Phase 1 development which was sanctioned in June of last year is well-advanced with first production of gross 120,000 barrels of oil per day expected by early 2020. Phase 2 development with gross production of 220,000 barrels of oil per day is on track for startup by mid-2022. A third phase of development at the Payara Field is expected to have a gross production capacity of approximately 180,000 barrels of oil per day with first production in 2023. We now see the potential to produce on a gross basis more than 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025 with industry-leading returns and cost metrics.","Also key to our strategy is the Bakken where we have a premier acreage position and a robust inventory of high-return drilling locations with a significant infrastructure advantage. During the quarter we continued testing limited entry plug-and-perf completions and higher proppant loadings, and initial results are encouraging. In September we added a sixth rig and we expect to generate capital-efficient production growth of 15% to 20% per year through 2021 along with a meaningful increase in free cash flow generation over this period.","Now, turning to our financial results. In the third quarter we had net income of $52 million or $0.14 per share compared to a net loss of $624 million or $2.02 per share in the year ago quarter. On an adjusted basis, net income was $123 million or $0.38 per common share compared with an adjusted net loss of $324 million or $1.07 per common share in the third quarter of 2017. Compared to 2017, our improved third quarter financial results primarily reflect higher realized crude oil selling prices combined with lower operating costs and DD&A expense.","We had a strong operating performance across our portfolio. Third quarter production was above the high end of our guidance range, averaging 279,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Net production from Libya was 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. For full year 2018, we expect production to average approximately 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, at the top end of our previous guidance of 245,000 to 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter, production is expected to average approximately 265,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.","Third quarter net production in the Bakken averaged 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 103,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter. For the full year 2018, we continue to forecast that Bakken net production will average between 115,000 and 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In summary, our reshaped portfolio is positioned to deliver a decade plus of capital efficient production growth with increasing cash generation and returns to shareholders. We look forward to providing a further update at our upcoming Investor Day on Wednesday, December 12 in Houston. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update of our operational performance for the quarter as we continue to execute our strategy. In the third quarter, company-wide production averaged 279,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This was nearly 10% above the midpoint of our guidance range of 250,000 to 260,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter and reflects strong performance across our portfolio.","In the Bakken, production averaged 118,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, in line with our guidance for the quarter, and we drilled 34 wells and brought 29 new wells online. Consistent with previous guidance, we added a sixth Bakken rig and a third frac spread in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast Bakken net production will increase to approximately 125,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day; and we expect to drill approximately 35 wells and bring 31 wells online, bringing the total for full year 2018 to 120 wells drilled and 100 new wells brought online.","Average IP 180 for the year, which will be dominated by our 60-stage sliding sleeve completion design, is expected to exceed 125,000 barrels of oil, an increase of approximately 15% from full year 2017. We are also seeing encouraging results from our transition to limited entry plug-and-perf completions. Of the 100 gross operated wells we now expect to bring online this year, approximately 30 are planned to be plug-and-perf. We'll provide further details regarding these new high-intensity completions at our Investor Day in December.","On August 31 we closed on the sale of our JV interests in the Utica shale play to Ascent Resources for approximately $400 million. As a result of the sale, fourth quarter net production will be reduced by approximately 10,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day relative to the third quarter.","Turning to the Gulf of Mexico. Net production came in well above guidance at 71,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting the return of production from the Conger Field in July, minimal weather-related downtime, and strong operating performance across all assets. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance to approximately 55,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the fourth quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 65,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day which includes 6,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day of planned downtime primarily associated with an inspection of one of the risers at the Conger Field.","Now moving to the Gulf of Thailand. Production from our Asian assets averaged 68,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day during the third quarter. At the joint development area in which Hess has a 50% interest, production averaged 37,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. Production is forecast to average approximately 36,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over the full year 2018. At the North Malay Basin, where Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, production averaged 31,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter which came in higher than expected due to a one-time rebalancing of entitlement volumes. Production is forecast to average approximately 26,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018.","Company-wide, we forecast fourth quarter production to be approximately 265,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Strong year-to-date performance across our portfolio enables us to raise our full year guidance to approximately 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day which is at the upper end of our previous guidance range of 245,000 to 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day despite the loss of volumes associated with the sale of our Utica assets.","Now turning to Exploration. In August we announced our ninth discovery, Hammerhead, on the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana in which Hess holds a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator. The well, which is located about 13 miles southwest of the Liza-1 discovery well, encountered 197 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing Miocene age sandstone reservoir, opening up a new play type. We recently completed a successful flow test and further appraisal activities are planned.","The Stenna Carron rig will now go to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands in Spain for recertification and is expected to return to the block in late December when we plan to spud a well on the upper Cretaceous Amara prospect located 24 miles southeast of the Turbot discovery. A second exploration vessel, the Noble Tom Madden drillship, has arrived in theater and is scheduled to spud a well on the Pluma prospect in early November. The well location is approximately 16 miles south of Turbot and will also target upper Cretaceous reservoirs on trend with the Turbot and Longtail discoveries.","In Suriname, Kosmos announced earlier this month that the Pontoenoe well on Block 42 in which Hess has a one-third interest failed to encounter commercial hydrocarbons and the well was expensed in the third quarter. The partners are studying the results of the well and will reprocess seismic to improve our understanding of the subsurface and regional geology. We continue to see multiple additional large prospects on the block which are independent from Pontoenoe and will be tested in 2020. In Canada, offshore Nova Scotia, BP continues drilling the Aspy play test well targeting a large subsalt structure analogous to those found in the Gulf of Mexico.","Moving to Guyana developments, Liza Phase 1 sanctioned in June 2017 remains on track for first oil by 2020 with a nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. Liza Phase 2 is also on track for first oil by mid-2022 with a nameplate capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day. And finally, Phase 3 is currently in feed with first oil expected in 2023. The operator is focused on maximizing value through rapid, phased developments and accelerated exploration plans.","In closing, we have once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery and we are well-positioned to deliver significant value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today I will compare results from the third quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2018. For the third quarter of 2018 we had net income of $52 million compared with a net loss of $130 million in the second quarter of 2018. On an adjusted basis which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we had net income of $123 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared with a net loss of $56 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P net income was $203 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $21 million in the second quarter of 2018. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P earnings between the third quarter and second quarter of 2018 were as follows. Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $146 million. Higher realized selling prices increased earnings by $65 million. Lower cash costs increased earnings by $12 million. Higher DD&A expense reduced earnings by $39 million. Higher exploration expense reduced earnings by $13 million. All other items increased earnings by $11 million for an overall increase in third quarter earnings of $182 million.","Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $30 million in both the third and second quarter of 2018. Midstream EBITDA before the non-controlling interest amounted to $130 million in the third quarter compared to $126 million in the previous quarter. For corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $122 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $191 million in the second quarter of 2018. After-tax adjusted corporate and interest expenses were $110 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $107 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to our financial position. Excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.6 billion, total liquidity was $7 billion including available committed credit facilities, and debt was $5.7 billion at September 30, 2018. Cash flow from operations before working capital changes and items affecting comparability was $738 million in the third quarter while cash expenditures for capital and investments were $566 million in the quarter. Changes in working capital reduced cash flows from operating activities by $258 million in the third quarter, reflecting premiums paid of $105 million on WTI crude oil hedging contracts for calendar 2019 and a payment of $84 million related to previously accrued legal claims associated with our former downstream interest. For calendar 2019, we have purchased WTI put options with a notional amount of 95,000 barrels of oil per day that have a monthly floor price of $60 per barrel.","In the third quarter we completed the sale of our joint venture interest in the Utica shale play for a net cash consideration of approximately $400 million. We also entered into a sale and leaseback agreement for a floating, storage and offloading vessel to handle produced condensate at our North Malay Basin project and received net proceeds of approximately $130 million. The gross lease obligation is reported as debt on our balance sheet and we will recover our partner share through future joint interest billings over the lease term.","In the third quarter we purchased $250 million of common stock, bringing total share repurchases under our previously announced $1.5 billion stock repurchase program to $1.25 billion. We plan to purchase the remaining $250 million in the fourth quarter.","Now turning to guidance. For E&P, in the third quarter our E&P cash costs were $11.41 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $11.87 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, which beat guidance on strong production and lower costs. On a pro forma basis, excluding Libya and Utica which was sold in August, cash costs in the third quarter were $12.20 per barrel of oil equivalent. We project cash costs for E&P operations, excluding Libya, in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $12.50 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent which includes planned maintenance costs at the Conger Field in the Gulf of Mexico. Full year 2018 cash costs are expected to be $12.50 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent which is down from previous guidance of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent.","DD&A expense in the third quarter was $16.14 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $17.03 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, which was below guidance. On a pro forma basis, excluding Libya and Utica, unit DD&A rates in the third quarter were $17.68 per barrel of oil equivalent. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter of 2018, and full year DD&A expense is projected to be $17 to $18 per barrel of oil equivalent which is down from previous guidance of $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, of $30.50 to $32.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and $29.50 to $31.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2018.","Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million in the fourth quarter with full year guidance expected to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million which is in the lower end of our previous guidance. The midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $170 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $655 million for the full year of 2018 which is up from previous guidance of approximately $635 million to $650 million. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 0% to 4% for the fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be a benefit in the range of 7% to 11% which is updated from the previous guidance of a benefit in the range of 16% to 20%.","For full year 2018, our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures guidance remains unchanged at $2.1 billion. Our 2018 crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We have $50 WTI put option contracts on a notional 115,000 barrels per day for the remainder of the year. We expect amortization of the premiums on these hedge contracts will reduce our financial results by approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter. For calendar 2019, we have purchased $60 WTI put option contracts with a notional amount of 95,000 barrels of oil per day for $116 million. We expect amortization of the calendar 2019 option premiums will reduce our financial results by approximately $29 million per quarter in 2019.","For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter with the full year guidance of approximately $115 million remaining unchanged. For corporate, for the fourth quarter of 2018 corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and for the full year guidance to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million which is in the lower end of our previous guidance. Interest expenses are estimated to be approximately $85 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $340 million for the full year of 2018 which is also at the low end of our previous guidance.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Bob Morris from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Nice quarter, John.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Greg, on the Bakken you've got 35 wells still to drill here in the fourth quarter. Looks like you've added five plug-and-perf wells in the slate. Where are those wells spread out between the four different areas in Q4 and where are you primarily drilling the plug-and-perf wells between Keene, Stony Creek, East Nesson, and Capa?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, they're actually spread out in a number of areas across the field. I don't have the actual well numbers in front of me but it's really spread out over our whole position.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. I didn't know if there was one area that sort of was left for the year end. So in the...","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","...sixth rig that you just added, where was that put? What area?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","That was put in the core.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","In Keene or Stony Creek?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, it was put in East Nesson.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","East Nesson? Okay. And then I was going to ask about the continued outperformance at Stony Creek and Keene but I guess you'll give us an update on all that here in December.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","I will absolutely at Investor Day.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. That's all I had for now. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I wonder if I could hit a couple of questions on exploration in Guyana to start off. Greg, I realize that Guyana is probably going to be a focus on December 12, but I just wonder if you could touch on the visibility you have today. I want to reflect on comments you made back in August about potentially fast-tracking Hammerhead. That's not in the 750,000 barrels a day or the more than 750,000 barrels a day as I understand it. And similarly, the latest thoughts on the scale of Payara\/Liza-3, and I've got a follow-up, please.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Okay, Doug. Well, first of all, Hammerhead, we just completed it at DST. Couple comments on Hammerhead to start. This is a massive accumulation. A very thick sand package. In fact, it's the thickest single sand package that we drilled on the block. It's a very large structure so it's going to require some additional appraisal. What we can say is that the results of the DST were good, meaning that the reservoir quality is excellent and the reservoir seems to be well-connected. You're right to say that Hammerhead's accretive to the 4 billion barrels and it could jump the queue in terms of being ahead of some of the other phases that were on the Turbot cluster, but it's too early to say that because we need some additional appraisal before we make that final decision. But, again, it is accretive to the 4 billion barrels. On the Payara cluster, as you mentioned, we're in feed. Right now, the vessel is sized at 180,000 barrels a day but that's still under discussion and will be part of the final project sanction towards the end of 2018.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you for that, Greg. And my follow-up on Guyana, if I may, is the exploration program. You mentioned the Amara prospect. I just want to be clear. Did that have another name? Was that Escolar (00:29:30) or is that something different? And if you could just give us an idea of where Ranger now fits in the queue because my understanding was (29:39) was going to go back to a Ranger appraisal at some point.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, Doug, you have a great memory. Amara is actually Escolar (00:29:48) or used to be called Escolar (00:29:49). Regarding the sequence of exploration and appraisal next year, that's still under discussion with the operator. We'll let you know once we get our budget finalized in 2019, but Ranger will be one of the things in the queue in 2019 obviously. But we've got some Hammerhead appraisal we want to do; there's some more work that we want to do in the Turbot area, so all that sequence is still being worked out.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Last one for me if I may, guys, is for the two Johns. And John Hess, I realize you've made your thoughts on share buybacks quite clear, but I guess I'm looking at the strength of the cash flow this quarter, the underlying cash flow. The demonstrable part of the portfolio obviously in this environment is pretty punchy. What is the right level of cash to carry on the balance sheet? And what's at the back of my mind really is you've got your preference issue maturing next year. I'm just wondering if there's a potential offsetting buyback that could dilute that or offset that dilution we're going to see next year, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Doug, as you know, we are currently purchasing our stock under our current program. We constantly assess our allocation of capital. And as you know, we have been a leader among our peers in return of capital so we will continue to balance investing in our highest-return projects and returning capital to shareholders. That's our investment proposition and that's the path we've been following and we will continue to follow.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great stuff. Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. I understand you're probably not willing to talk too much about the 2019 program, but can you talk about the planning process and how you balance oil price uncertainty against the capital program and against building free cash flow?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure, Bob. So the first thing as you heard that we were looking at, we've always looked at 2019 again as with our bridge to Guyana coming in 2020 and we know we're investing in Phase 1 and now you know we're going to be also investing in Phase 2 and others, that the first thing we did, we put the 95,000 barrels a day of WTI put options in place. So watching oil volatility, we made sure we put a floor on that price for us for a good part of our production to ensure that we have that base cash flow. So we will, as you said, we'll be talking a lot more about this later on in our Investor Day. But while our budgeting process is underway, we're really excited about our capital and exploratory expenditure program through 2025. We think it's distinctive kind of as John Hess talked about earlier, that it'll deliver capital-efficient production growth that generates significant free cash flow over the period.","So just to be high level, talking about the activity levels that Greg was discussing, our 2019 budget will be closer to $3 billion. But it's important to note that all that incremental spend between 2018 and 2019 will be targeted, in our view, to the highest-return investments in the E&P business, and that's our Bakken and Guyana assets. And then just going longer-term, and again we'll give more detail on this, but maintaining our disciplined capital allocation, we currently expect capital and exploratory expenditures to average approximately $3 billion per year through 2025 and the portfolio to be cash-generative post-2020. And I would tell you, for now what we're looking at from a planning assumption case is using a $60 WTI and a $65 Brent. But, again, we'll provide more information later on in our Investor Day in December but, again, really excited about that.","Just specifically because Greg had mentioned it, what's going on in the Bakken, it's basically that incremental spend is almost half and half between the Bakken and Guyana. So in the Bakken we're going to be operating six rigs, that's 30% higher rig count than 2018, and right now probably approximately 50% more wells online in 2019 than 2018. So the vast majority also of those wells in 2019 are expected to be the higher-intensity plug-and-perf completions which currently carry an incremental cost of about $1.5 million per well versus our previous sliding sleeve design. But these wells are expected to deliver increases in both IP, rates, and more significantly in NPV. So it'll result in our Bakken production exceeding our previous guidance of 175,000 barrels per day by 2021.","Then in Guyana, we have the peak spend on Phase 1 in 2019. From our previous sanctioned release in 2019, it was about an $80 million increase in 2019 for Phase 1. And now you're going to see the commencement of spending for Phase 2. And remember, Phase 1, the initial year was $110 million so Phase 2 is obviously bigger than Phase 1, so you're going to see a little more spending for that. As well now feed costs for FPSOs 3 and 4 most likely and we are bringing the additional drill ship in, the Noble Tom Madden for next year. So that's kind of just high level. We'll go into more detail on it. But, again, from our overall program we're going to be generating significant free cash flow over the period because of these investments in Bakken and Guyana.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, appreciate the color. A quick follow-up. Adding that second exploration rig to Guyana, can you talk about how many wells you can get down in 2019 and how you'd split those across exploration of brand new concepts, exploration across the proven concepts, and then kind of appraisal\/development?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, Bob, obviously it depends on what we find as we continue to explore the block. Again, that whole sequence hasn't been lined out yet with the operator but we know that we want to do some more appraisal in Hammerhead, so there will be some more there. We know we've got some more exploration\/appraisal around Turbot. We know that we've got appraisal at Ranger. We know that we're going to drill this Hamira (00:36:28) well which could lead to more appraisal. And in addition to that, we have 20 additional prospects and leads that we'd like to drill on the block. So it's going to be a mix of exploration and appraisal and it really depends upon what we find as to how much appraisal we need. So we'll give you more color when we do our budget for 2019.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","As we try to figure out the cash flow piece of the equation for next year, and we look specifically at the Gulf of Mexico where there was a nice step-up in production and it seems like maybe you're free and clear of some of the issues over the last year and a half, is 70,000 barrels a day or BOE a day the new normal when there's no downtime and how do you think about a more sustainable run rate of production and then the CapEx required to keep it there?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So what we've always said in the Gulf of Mexico is that kind of 65,000 barrels a day is a level of production that we can maintain here for several years because of the tieback opportunities that we have. So in 2019 we do have two rigs contracted, right, so we'll be completing the drilling and stampede with those two rigs. And then we talked about between signs of kind of like $100 million and $150 million that we spend every year just to do some tieback opportunities and hold that Gulf of Mexico production right around 65,000 barrels per day.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, thank you. And then shifting to the Bakken, and I guess obviously we'll get more details shortly here in December, but to follow-up on the points you just made on the closer to $3 billion in 2019 CapEx overall, can you talk more on the Bakken specifically in terms of rig adds and then also expectations for well productivity\/intensity and then also takeaway?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Okay. Let me let me take the first two and then John can talk about the takeaway. Certainly, our plan for next year is to hold six rigs flat. So we added that sixth rig in the third quarter and our plan is just to hold the rig count at six. As I mentioned, we're transitioning to a plug-and-perf completion, so that'll be a 10 million pound per well proppant loading that was confirmed as the optimum in the Bakken study. Just a few words about the Bakken study. Remember, that was an independent third party look that examined over 10,000 wells, both ours and our competitors, and the study confirmed a couple things. First of all, it confirmed that our use of sliding sleeves and tight spacing during the downturn maximized DSU NPV which has always been our objective, and then secondly that the transition to plug-and-perf in 2018 as a result of improving technology and lower costs in that space is the right strategy to deliver more value going forward.","And as John Rielly mentioned previously, the cost of those wells currently right now is running about $7.5 million per well, so about $1.5 million above the sliding sleeve completion. However, just as we did with the sliding sleeves, we begin to apply lean manufacturing to that process and we're reasonably confident that we can bring those well costs down over time as we apply lean manufacturing. But we will transition to that design over the remainder of 2018 and into 2019 on plug-and-perf. And, again, we'll give more color on that in our Investor Day in December.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. And, Brian, fair question. In terms of takeaway, our company does not have an issue in terms of takeaway capacity from the Bakken because of the pre-investment we've done to have access to multiple export markets, and that flexibility really positions us well to maximize the value of our sales netbacks. The recent widening in the Clearbrook differential began with October trading and is primarily the result of unusually high Mid-Continent refinery maintenance, not a takeaway issue, where that maintenance shut in more than 1 million barrels per day of refinery capacity. We expect this refinery demand to return in December with differentials narrowing towards historical levels. And our strategy of having these multiple export markets to maximize the value of our sales netbacks, recently in June when Clearbrook was a premium, was about $1 over WTI, we were actually maxing sales into the Clearbrook market. And in the current market, we are currently delivering about 70% of our crude to export markets where we receive Brent-based pricing which is about $6 over WTI. And in terms of the future, we're well-positioned now but we will continue to look at potential pipeline expansions as they may occur and may add additional firm transportation in the future to further optimize our marketing efforts.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just curious on the comment on the Williston and the new plug-and-perf-focused program being able to deliver higher peak volumes relative to the prior 175 MBOE a day that you all had discussed. Any willingness to talk about what that new peak looks like and how long you can hold it? What sort of rig and annual completion cadence is required to do that?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, we will talk about that at our Investor Day in December. But you're right. The peak is going to go up. Our current plan on the Bakken which, again, we'll cover on Investor Day is to take it to that new peak level, drop the rigs to four, and then hold it at that new peak level for a number of years. And, yeah, at that point the Bakken becomes a massive cash generator for the company, so cash flow will be significantly up in the Bakken. So as John Rielly mentioned, post-2020 you really have all of our assets generating free cash, significant amounts of free cash flow. And then of course, in 2022 when Phase 2 comes on, then Guyana becomes a major cash flow-generating asset. So you'll have all four assets generating significant amounts of cash when Phase 2 comes on.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, that's helpful. How about how long you can hold that peak? Any commentary there at this point?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","We'll, again, talk about that in December but it will be multiple years.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then I guess maybe just on Suriname. Any additional color or commentary on what you guys have learned here post-mortem on the initial test? And it sounds like additional activity is not planned until 2020, but any spending that we should expect in 2019 as it relates to that asset?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","I think first of all, the Pontoenoe well encountered 63 meters of really high-quality reservoir. Unfortunately it was wet, but now we're taking all that data from the well and we're going to recalibrate the seismic, rerun all the seismic, and that'll help inform future exploration in Suriname. But despite the dry hole, we still believe the block has significant resource potential as there's multiple play types on the block. So as you mentioned, current thinking is we won't get back to drilling until 2020 on the block and give us a good amount of time to reprocess things and understand what we saw.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ajun (sic) [Arun] (00:45:43), your line is now open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","John, appreciate your comments on the Bakken takeaway where I think you are better positioned than your peers given your 50,000 barrels per day or so on DAPL, et cetera, and I think you only sell about 20% in the local markets today. My question is as we think about the incremental barrel that you produce in the Bakken, in our model we have you going from the mid-70s in oil to the low 90s in oil. So for those incremental barrels, where would you be selling those? Would they be on rail, et cetera? So just trying to understand what kind of diffs you could see on the incremental barrels that you're producing next year.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Good question, Arun. Our plan would be to continue to access Brent-based pricing between pipeline deliveries to the Gulf Coast and also rail deliveries either to the Gulf Coast, East Coast or West Coast.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. And that's based on rail capacity that you have today or one or...?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yes. Yeah, we're positioned for this now. And we'll also look at, as I said, potential pipeline expansions and may add additional firm transportation on those to ensure that we continue to optimize our differentials by getting access to offshore Brent-based pricing.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I understand you guys are going to leave quite a bit for the Bakken for the December update. But the plan as I understand is to do about 50% more POPs are tied in line in the Bakken in 2019. Is that correct, like 150 wells or so?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yes. Yes, you can make that assumption there with the six rigs at right around 150 and maybe a little bit more.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And my final question is, John, you mentioned that CapEx could approach $3 billion or so in 2019. Is that just in the E&P level or does that include with the consolidation of the Midstream the Midstream piece of that as well? Or if you could separate the two, that would be helpful.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","That's the E&P portion and includes the spend for exploration as well. So that's just that E&P, yeah.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Morning.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Two quick questions. John, on the well capacity, can you tell us how much you plan to ship from Bakken in the fourth quarter? And also, we've heard from people saying that the well operator that they are unwilling to increase the (00:48:35) unless you are willing to sign multiple year contract. Is that what you, guys, are seeing?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","In terms of takeaway capacity, right now, I mentioned it before, it's about 70% of our crude is going to export markets where we can receive Brent-based spot pricing, most of it on DAPL, out to Nederland, and then some to both the East Coast and West Coast via train. And in terms of going forward, there are multiple pipeline expansion opportunities. We're looking at them and the terms and conditions of those vary.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Can you share with us that? I mean, how much is the cost for you to move from Bakken to the East Coast if you're going to (00:49:25)?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Well, I tell you, what I would say is going down south to Nederland is about $7. And train's a little bit higher than that, West Coast being closer to that number, East Coast being a little higher.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Read, Read, whatever it needs to be today I guess. Good morning, guys.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","How you doing?","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Doing all right, thanks. Just one thing I'd like to follow up on on the CapEx side, the move from kind of $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion this year to $3 billion overall. You mention kind of half between the Bakken and half between Guyana. Since we had obviously a little spending on Utica and maybe some other places this year, kind of what's the right increment? Is that to think about it as $900 million and $450 million, $450 million or it's a larger number as the starting point is slightly different? And then maybe other way to think about it is does exploration spending go up from here relative to what we've seen which I would think has to happen given a second rig in Guyana and then potential in 2020 to restart in Suriname? So maybe just a little clarity on that if you could.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. So first, outside like you said Utica or assets like that, we were not spending much capital in 2018 on that. So the base that you should start with is the $2.1 billion because our capital guidance remains unchanged, and so then moving up, I'd say, going to that, closer to $3 billion. There's a little bit more going to Bakken than Guyana. And if you can just \u2013 I'll do some simple math for you. Bakken guidance was approximately $900 million for this year. We're about at 4.75 rigs and we're going to six rigs for the full year. On average we're 4.75 rigs. Just do the math on that, you'll get about $240 million just with everything being exactly the same.","Then as Greg and I had mentioned, the current plug-and-perf wells are approximately $1.5 million higher. We're going to be drilling a lot more of them next year than we did this year. So just simply, if you took that 150 times $1.5 million, put our working interests around 80% or so in it, you can kind of see how you're getting to the numbers there in the Bakken. So it's simply like that. And then Guyana, it's exactly what I talked about before. It's just the additional drill ship. That factors in for exploration. So when I was talking about Guyana, that included this additional exploration spend from that additional drill ship.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. And, Roger, just again to, I'd say, reemphasize the point that John made earlier, the increment in CapEx is going to very high-return projects, the increment being probably in the range of 30% to 50% IRRs, very quick paybacks. While next year we'll ramp up in CapEx, we should start becoming cash flow-positive in a $60 WTI, $65 Brent world. In 2020, covering the CapEx and dividend, we should become cash flow-generative there. And then the outlook going past that, and we'll go over this at Investor Day, is that CapEx going forward probably is going to be in the range of $3 billion, holding flat out to 2025. So our portfolio becomes very cash-generative, putting us in a great position to balance investing in the business in the high returns going forward and also returning capital to our shareholders.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's great clarity. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Morning.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I wanted to just ask a quick question regarding the expectations for the Pluma exploration well that you mentioned in the press release. And I'm really asking this because I'm trying to get some sort of a feel for how the hubs are going to develop. If it was successful, would it more likely be a tie-in to Turbot or could it potentially support stand-alone production?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, I think it'll be part of that what we call the greater Turbot complex. We're really trying to define that to understand how many vessels it's going to take to evacuate that, right, that area. There's a lot of accumulations there that we want to get a drill bit in.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And I just wanted a quick question, just a little color on the improved Bakken well performance that was mentioned in the press release. I was just wondering is there anything new going on at the completion candidate or was this just an example of exceeding prior expectations?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, I think it's just continuous improvement in completion practices. That number that I gave you is primarily dominated by sliding sleeves fleet. So recall this year we increased the proppant loading in our 60-stage sliding sleeves to 140,000 pounds per stage, so that's about 8.4 million pounds on the sliding sleeve. So primarily that number I gave you reflects that increase in proppant in sliding sleeves. In addition to that, we're also transitioning to plug-and-perf. And based on the results of the Bakken study and some of the very preliminary results that we got from our early plug-and-perf trials, that move to 10 million pounds is going to be very value-accretive. So we'll give you some more color on that in December but that'll be to \u2013 the first jump was sliding sleeve move, the next jump will be plug-and-perf, and you'll get an increment on each of those.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. Yeah, that's very helpful and I look forward to the Analyst Day in December. Thank you.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi everyone.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Hi.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Actually, John Hess just hit the nail on the head I was going to ask about the run rate of CapEx given next year's number, but you clearly answered that one so thank you there. Maybe I could ask on DD&A coming down. Could you give the outlook for that dynamic, what caused it to come in below expectations, and what do you think the outlook is there? Thank you.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","And, Paul, before John Rielly answers it, I understand congratulations are in order for your marriage. So I want to get that out first.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","I appreciate that, John. Thank you very much indeed.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Paul, the DD&A in the third quarter, really, the better performance in guidance was due to the production. So what we had was that higher production in the Gulf of Mexico with lower DD&A, and so that's what's driving that third quarter DD&A rate down. And then on a go-forward basis, as we project into the future kind of what John was talking about with always our capital being focused in those high-return Bakken and Guyana assets, we continue to see over this period through 2025 that our DD&A rate will continue to come down, and we'll give more information on that on the Investor Day.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Great. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. It seems like every week now there is a parent company that is taking back and acquiring its MLP. In that context, I thought I would get your thoughts on how committed you are and Global Infrastructure Partners is to maintaining Hess Midstream as a stand-alone public entity.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I mean, it hasn't been that long since we've done the IPO of the Midstream. And the Midstream has been performing fantastically and it's been a great partner for us in this build-out of infrastructure. And as we're going to talk about obviously moving to the plug-and-perf and our increasing production above the 175,000 barrels per day, having that midstream partner, GIP, and Hess Midstream overall will really help us in that. And as John had mentioned before in our takeaway capacity, it's really just in general put us in a great place from a revenue standpoint and a cost standpoint. So where we are with that? I know what you've been talking about. We've been watching that happen in the market but it's early days. We've got plenty of growth left in that public midstream vehicle that we have. We're happy with its performance and expect it to continue to perform well.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And one question about Guyana that \u2013 you'll maybe hold off on this until the Analyst Day, but you're very close to approving Phase 2. You're talking about five total. For a country as small as Guyana, and that has never had an oil industry, are you facing any labor shortages or other kinds of bottlenecks as you're creating essentially a brand new value chain where none has existed before?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. So far there's no issues with labor shortage. Remember, this is an offshore development so the majority of everything is floated in, right, and the work is all done offshore. And I think ExxonMobil as operator has done a great job in maximizing local content where possible.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Sorry for lining up again. I just wanted to clarify something on the capital program. So, John Rielly, I know you don't want to give details on the Guyana fiscal contract. But exploration costs on the entire block as I understand it can be recovered from any revenue? Is that still the case? In which case, once you've got first oil what can you say about the cost recovery on the exploration dollars?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","The contract works as the whole block is the ring fence, so all costs can be recovered once production starts. So you are correct in what you said.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And that applies to development dollars on subsequent phases as well?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yes, it does.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great stuff, thank you. And just one final quick one on the MLP given that question just got asked. Is your plan still to monetize units on the MLP over time?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","We are committed to the MLP and we don't have the need as Hess to monetize anything right now and neither does GIP because basically the drop-downs from Hess is going to Midstream Partners and we have a multi-year runway where we don't need to do any drop-downs into the MLP, so I just want to be clear. And I also want to be clear that Hess and GIP are committed to the MLP and continuing the growth trajectory and really maximizing value from our investment in the Midstream business.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"10822":["Hess Corp.

My name is Ayeila, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.","Thank you, Ayeila. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information, which will be provided on our website during the Hess Midstream Partners Conference call today at 4:30 PM.","Now, as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I will review our overall strategy and plans. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and 2018 guidance, and John Rielly will review our financial results.","Our company is making significant progress in our strategy: to grow our resource base in a capital-disciplined manner; to move down the cost curve so that we are resilient in a low oil price environment; and to be cash-generative at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price post 2020.","In 2017, consistent with our strategy, we moved aggressively to high-grade and focus our portfolio by investing in our highest return assets in Guyana and the Bakken and divesting higher cost mature assets. This portfolio high-grading in turn is lowering our cash unit operating costs, bolstering our balance sheet and enabling us to pre-fund our world-class Guyana oil developments while also returning capital to shareholders and reducing debt.","Our portfolio is now focused on Guyana and the Bakken as our growth engines and Malaysia and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as our cash engines. On a pro forma basis, we expect to generate capital-efficient compound annual production growth of approximately 10% per year through 2020. The combination of investing in lower cost assets and divesting higher cost assets along with a meaningful $150 million annual cost reduction program is expected to drive our cash unit production cost down by approximately 30% to less than $10 per barrel of oil equivalent by 2020.","As a result, we expect to generate cash flow growth of more than 20% per year at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price and more than 30% per year at a $60 per barrel Brent oil price through 2020.","In terms of our portfolio high-grading, our asset monetizations in 2017 resulted in total proceeds of $3.4 billion and the release of $1.3 billion of asset retirement obligations. In October, we announced the sale of our mature higher-cost assets in Norway for total proceeds of $2 billion and Equatorial Guinea for total proceeds of $650 million. Both transactions closed in the fourth quarter as planned.","These sales followed the divestiture of our mature Permian enhanced oil recovery assets in August for total proceeds of $600 million and the successful IPO of Hess Midstream Partners in April that resulted in net proceeds of $175 million. In addition, we have commenced a sales process for our interest in Denmark, which we expect to complete in 2018.","Proceeds from our asset sales will first and foremost be used to pre-fund our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana. In addition, we plan to increase from four rigs to six rigs in the Bakken in the second half of 2018, where we have a robust inventory of high-return drilling locations. Also, we intend to buy back up to $500 million in stock and reduce debt of $500 million.","As we get further clarity on the capital requirements for future phases of development in Guyana as well as the outlook for oil prices, we plan to evaluate additional returns of capital to shareholders. Key to our strategy is our position in Guyana, an extraordinary oil investment opportunity that is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, cost, rapid cash paybacks and superior financial returns. The Stabroek block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest, covers 6.6 million acres and contains a massive world-class resource that keeps getting bigger and better.","We have discovered some of the highest quality reservoirs in the world with high porosity and permeability that are expected to deliver very high recovery factors and production rates. Also, ExxonMobil, as a world-class operator, brings extensive project management experience and a great track record with this type of development.","In January, we announced a sixth oil discovery on the Stabroek block with a Ranger-1 well, which encountered 230 feet of high-quality oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. This world-class discovery confirms the presence of a working petroleum system more than 60 miles northwest of the Liza development area, increasing the prospectivity of this part of the block where we see a number of large exploration prospects.","Excluding Ranger, estimated gross discovered recoverable resources on the block were recently increased to more than 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from the prior range of 2.5 billion to 2.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In addition, we continue to see multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential across the block. The Liza Phase 1 development, which was sanctioned last June, will develop approximately 450 million barrels of oil through an FPSO vessel that will have the gross capacity to produce up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day.","Development drilling is planned to start later this year. First production from the Liza Phase 1 development is expected in March 2020. An application for an environmental permit to develop the second phase at Liza has been submitted. The concept involves a larger FPSO and subsea systems that would have a production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day with startup expected by mid-2022.","As you may have seen from ExxonMobil's announcement last Friday, planning is also underway for a third phase of development with an FPSO at Payara, closely following Liza Phase 2. The size of this third ship will be a function of future appraisal drilling. With $7 per barrel unit development cost for Liza Phase 1 and cash payback in approximately three years at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price, our investment opportunity in Guyana is one of the most attractive in the world today.","Now, turning to our 2017 financial results. Our adjusted net loss was $1.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion in 2016. And cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $1.7 billion, up from $842 million in the prior year. As you saw in our release, we took a non-cash charge of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter for an accounting write-down of our Tubular Bells and Stampede assets to fair value. John Rielly we'll talk more about this. But the charge was required under the accounting rules given our lower long-term oil price outlook and has no impact on our portfolios' ability to generate free cash flow at a $50 per barrel Brent to oil price post 2020.","In terms of 2017 reserve replacement, we had an outstanding year. We replaced 351% percent of production with proved reserve additions of 397 million barrels of oil equivalent at an F&D cost of just over $5 per barrel of oil equivalent. Proved reserves at yearend stood at 1.15 billion barrels of oil equivalent, higher than 2016 even with asset sales that reduced reserves by 239 million barrels and production of 113 million barrels of oil equivalent during 2017. And our reserve life was 10.2 years.","Full year production for 2017 was 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Pro forma for the sales of our interest in Norway, Equatorial Guinea and Permian-enhanced oil recovery assets, our production 2017 was 242,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.","In 2018, our production is forecast to average between 245,000 and 255,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This forecast reflects reduced production of 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to asset sales and 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to the unplanned shutdown of Shell's Enchilada platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which is expected to be partially offset by growth in the Bakken and higher volumes from North Malay Basin. From our 2017 pro forma base of 242,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, we remain on track to deliver 10% compounded annual production growth through 2020.","Now, turning to the Bakken, our largest operated growth asset. We have an industry-leading position with more than 500,000 net acres in the core of the play and are on track to grow production to approximately 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 compared to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017.","Through the application of geo steering, optimized spacing, higher stage counts and profit loading, we have increased our well productivity by approximately 50% over the last two years. These improvements, together with our low drilling and completion costs, have enabled us to generate returns that are competitive with any shale play in the United States.","The increased activity from two additional rigs in 2018 is expected to generate capital-efficient production growth of 15% to 20% per year through 2020 and deliver average returns that are in the range of 40% to 50% at a $50 per barrel WTI price from 2018 wells online. Bakken production in 2017 averaged 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and in 2018 is forecast to average between 115,000 and 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In summary, we continue to execute on our strategy, and our reshaped portfolio is positioned to deliver a decade-plus of capital-efficient growth, with increasing cash generation and returns to shareholders. The success of our asset sales program in 2017 further focuses our portfolio on higher return assets and lowers our cash unit costs, while strengthening our balance sheet to fund our world-class oil investment opportunity in Guyana, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders for many years to come.","Now, Greg.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thanks, John. 2017 was marked by strong execution, both strategically and operationally. First, in terms of our developments, we achieved first gas in July at the North Malay Basin full field development where Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, safely, on time and under budget.","During the fourth quarter, North Malay Basin reached its planned plateau rate of approximately 165 million cubic feet of net gas per day, establishing the asset as a significant long-term, low-cost cash generator for the company. Throughout 2017, we also successfully advanced development of the Stampede field, where Hess is operator and has a 25% interest. I'm pleased to announce that we have achieved first oil from the field in January.","The Hess team, working effectively with our partners Chevron, Statoil, and Nexen, delivered a highly complex project in just over three years from sanction safely, ahead of schedule, and under budget. We intend to gradually ramp up production over the next 18 months.","Second, in the Bakken, we executed successful pilots of 60-stage completions with increased proppant loading, which confirmed that we are getting a 10% to 15% uplift in IP180 productivity and expected ultimate recovery, or EUR, from our previous standard. As a result, we've increased our EUR estimate from our Bakken acreage to 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent from our previous estimate of 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent.","Wells brought online in 2018 are expected to deliver an average EUR of greater than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent and generate returns of 40% to 50% at a $50 per barrel WTI. In addition, we've increased by 25% the number of wells that can deliver a 15% return or higher at $50 per barrel WTI to 1,780 wells, which represents more than 60% of our remaining well inventory.","Third, on the 6.6 million acre Stabroek block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest, the extraordinary exploration success continues with discoveries in 2017 at Payara, Snoek, Liza Deep and Turbot. In January, we announced a sixth oil discovery. The Ranger-1 well encountered approximately 230 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. This is important in that it demonstrates a working petroleum system more than 60 miles northwest of Liza and opens up multiple further play types across the Stabroek block.","Excluding Ranger, discovered recoverable resources for the block were increased to 3.2 billion gross barrels of oil equivalent, more than triple the estimate from this time last year. In June 2017, we sanctioned the first phase of Liza development, which will develop on a gross basis approximately 450 million barrels of oil through an FPSO vessel with gross capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. First production from the Liza Phase 1 development is expected in March 2020.","Fourth, we successfully executed $3.4 billion of monetizations in 2017, with values and timing that exceeded expectations.","Fifth, we delivered proved reserve additions of 397 million net barrels of oil equivalent, representing an organic replacement rate of 351% and an F&D cost of just over $5 per barrel of oil equivalent. About 70% of the additions were in the Bakken, reflecting new proved undeveloped reserves, improved prices, and our enhanced completion designs. Other significant additions include North Malay Basin and Stampede, as well as initial reserve bookings in Guyana.","Now, turning to results and starting with production. In the fourth quarter, production averaged 282,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This result reflects unplanned downtime at the Shell-operated Enchilada platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which experienced a fire on November 8 and remains down.","As a result, production is shut-in at our Baldpate, Conger and Penn State fields, as well as the Shell-operated Llano field with a daily production impact of approximately 30,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. The operator is working to safely restore production. Excluding Libya, full-year 2017 production averaged 295,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which reflects an impact from the unplanned downtime in Enchilada of approximately 4,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In 2018, we forecast production to average between 245,000 and 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This forecast reflects the divestments completed in 2017, representing approximately 60,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and an estimated annual impact from Enchilada of 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2018.","Our forecast also reflects higher year-over-year production from the Bakken and North Malay Basin of 12,000 and 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, respectively, as well as increasing production from Stampede.","We forecast production in the first quarter of 2018 to average in the range of 220,000 to 225,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, increasing to between 265,000 and 275,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, as our impacted Gulf of Mexico production is reinstated and as Bakken and Stampede ramp up. On a pro forma basis, net production is forecast to grow by approximately 10% per year between 2017 and 2020.","Now, turning to the Bakken. In the fourth quarter, production averaged 110,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represented an increase of more than 15% from the year-ago quarter. Oil production in the fourth quarter was 69,000 net barrels per day versus 63,000 net barrels per day for the third quarter of 2017. For the full-year 2017, production averaged 105,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In 2018, we plan to add a fifth rig in the Bakken during the third quarter and a sixth rig during the fourth quarter. The timing reflects permitting and the efficiency of doing road and pad construction during the fair weather period between May and October. We expect to drill approximately 120 wells and bring approximately 95 new wells online over the year, compared to 85 wells drilled and 68 wells brought online in 2017.","For the first quarter, we expect Bakken production to average approximately 105,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting a modest reduction in NGL volumes due to market factors. Oil volumes are expected to remain flat with the fourth quarter of 2017.","For the full-year 2018, we forecast our Bakken production to average between 115,000 and 120,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, approximately 12% above 2017 levels. Longer term, we continue to forecast steady Bakken production growth to approximately 175,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 with a maximum rig count of 6.","Moving offshore, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production averaged 40,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 54,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2017, reflecting the unplanned downtime at the Shell-operated Enchilada platform discussed earlier.","As a consequence, we forecast 2018 production from our deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets to average approximately 50,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which again assumes a full year production impact of 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter, when all impacted fields are expected to be back online, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 65,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day.","At the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess has a 50% interest, production averaged 35,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 37,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2017. Net production is forecast to average approximately 36,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018.","At the North Malay Basin, also in the Gulf of Thailand, net production averaged 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the fourth quarter and is forecast to also average approximately 26,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018.","Turning to Guyana. Following completion of the Ranger-1 well, the Stena Carron drillship has now spud the Pacora prospect, which is located 4 miles west of the Payara discovery. Additional exploration drilling is planned on the Stabroek Block for 2018, including appraisal of the Liza, Turbot and Ranger discoveries as well as a wider exploration program that will target additional prospects and play types on the block where we continue to see multi-billion barrels of exploration upside.","Development activities are also continuing on the Stabroek Block. The Liza Phase 1 development is progressing and remains on track for first oil in March 2020. Conversion of a VLCC, very large crude carrier, to an FPSO is progressing; and development drilling is planned to start later this year.","In addition, planning for the second phase of development of Liza is underway. That is expected to utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Startup for Lisa Phase 2 is expected by mid-2022. A third phase of development will focus on the Payara area and is expected to closely follow Liza Phase 2.","In Suriname, where Hess holds a 33% interest in the 1.3-million acre Block 42 along with Chevron and the operator Kosmos, interpretation of 3D seismic continues and we are seeing a set of attractive prospects and leads similar to those seen on Stabroek. A first exploration well on the block is planned for the second half of 2018. At the 2.8-million acre Block 59, where Hess also holds a 30% \u2013 33% interest together with Statoil and the operator Exxon Mobil, plans are underway to acquire 2D seismic in 2018.","In Canada, Hess has partnered with operator BP to explore four deepwater frontier licenses offshore Nova Scotia, which combined are equal in size to approximately 600 deepwater Gulf of Mexico OCS blocks. Hess has a 50% working interest. Based on 3D seismic data, the geology appears analogous to deepwater Gulf of Mexico. A first play test is planned to spud in the second quarter of 2018.","In closing, in 2017, Hess once again demonstrated strong execution on all fronts. We have taken proactive steps to high-grade our portfolio, move down the cost curve and build a business that will be cash flow-generative down to $50 per barrel Brent post 2020. Our leading position in the Bakken promises continuing growth and material future cash flow. Exploration results to-date underline the exceptional world-class potential for the Stabroek Block in Guyana, and we are excited by potential extensions of the plays into Blocks 42 and 59 in neighboring Suriname.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2017 and provide guidance for 2018.","We incurred a net loss of $2.677 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a net loss of $624 million in the previous quarter. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $304 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with an adjusted net loss of $324 million in the previous quarter.","Fourth quarter results include an after-tax gain of $486 million from the sale of our interest in Equatorial Guinea and an after-tax loss of $857 million from the sale of our interest in Norway, both in line with estimates provided in our third quarter Form 10-Q. The fourth quarter also includes charges related to the Tubular Bells and Stampede Fields in the Gulf of Mexico totaling $1.7 billion primarily based on a fourth quarter reduction to our long-term oil price outlook used in our impairment tests.","The charge related to Tubular Bells is $605 million, while the charge related to Stampede is $1.095 billion, where we incurred significant exploration and appraisal costs prior to unitizing into the Stampede project.","In addition, we fully impaired our Deepwater Tano\/Cape Three Points project offshore Ghana with an after-tax charge of $280 million based on management's decision to not pursue that development project. We are currently evaluating options to monetize our Ghana asset.","Turning to the new tax law. In December, the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, providing broad changes to the taxation of both domestic and foreign operations. We do not expect any U.S. federal cash tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and the impact of the change in alternative minimum tax rules was immaterial. Further, we still do not anticipate any U.S. federal cash taxes over at least the next five years.","Our tax loss carry-forwards and tax basis and fixed assets as of December 31, 2017 will continue to provide a significant cash tax shield. And under the new law, substantially all of our foreign earnings will qualify for exemption from U.S. federal tax. The decrease in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% leads to an approximate $1.475 billion reduction to our U.S. net deferred tax asset, which predominantly relates to the NOL carry-forward. A corresponding reduction in the previously established U.S. valuation allowance offsets this adjustment. Consequently, the re-measurement of deferred taxes using the newly enacted tax rate has no net impact on the income statement or balance sheet.","Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $219 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a net loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2017. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2017 were as follows: higher realized selling prices improved results by $133 million; non-cash option premium amortization on crude oil collars reduced results by $38 million; the change in mix of sales volumes reduced results by $33 million; higher exploration expenses, primarily seismic costs, reduced results by $32 million; higher cash costs reduced results by $17 billion; lowered DD&A expense improved results by $18 million. All other items reduced results by $12 million for an overall improvement in fourth quarter results of $19 million.","The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding specials and Libyan operations, was an expense of 21% for the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to the accounting for assets held-for-sale, compared with a benefit of 18% in the third quarter.","Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $20 million in the fourth quarter compared to adjusted net income of $22 million in the third quarter of 2017. Midstream EBITDA, before the non-controlling interest and excluding specials, amounted to $113 million in the fourth quarter compared to $109 million in the third quarter of 2017.","Turning to corporate and interest. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $105 million in the fourth quarter compared to a net adjusted expense of $108 million in the third quarter of 2017.","Turning to fourth quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $492 million. Changes in working capital reduced operating cash flows by $149 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $554 million. Proceeds from the sale of assets were $2.513 billion. Net borrowings increased cash by $280 million. Common stock acquired and retired were $110 million.","Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $90 million. Distributions to non-controlling interest were $35 million. All other items were a net decrease in cash of $26 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $2.321 billion. We estimate the fourth quarter impact from the Enchilada platform shutdown was a reduction to cash flow from operations of approximately $55 million.","Turning to our financial position. Excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $4.5 billion. Total liquidity was $8.9 billion, including available committed credit facilities; and debt was $5.997 billion. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and providing current returns to shareholders.","In January, we called for redemption of our 8.125% notes due February 2019 with a principal amount of $350 million, and we plan to repay an additional $150 million principal amount of debt in 2018 for a total of $500 million in debt reduction. We also continued to execute our previously announced plan to repurchase $500 million of our common stock. We purchased $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and plan to purchase the remaining $380 million of stock during 2018.","Turning to our cost reduction program. As part of our portfolio reshaping, we have begun implementation of an organization restructuring and cost reduction effort, targeting annual savings of $150 million. In addition to direct head count reductions as part of our asset sales, we eliminated approximately 400 employee and contractor positions in January and expect to record employee severance of $40 million to $50 million in the first quarter. Since the end of 2014, total employee and contractor positions have been reduced by approximately 50%.","In addition to the workforce reduction, we have identified further cost reductions in logistics, information technology, property, professional fees and other operating cost as a result of our portfolio reshaping. The benefit from this $150 million annualized cost reduction will begin to be realized over the second half of 2018.","Now, turning to first quarter and full year 2018 guidance. Before I give guidance for 2018, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings, I will provide full year 2017 pro forma financial metrics that removed the impact of assets sold during the year. Pro forma cash costs were $13.09 per barrel of oil equivalent as compared to actual results of $14.30 per barrel, and pro forma DD&A was $23.62 per barrel versus actual DD&A of $24.53 per barrel.","Finally, our pro forma tax rate, excluding specials and Libya, was a pro forma benefit of 4% as compared to our reported benefit of 7%. We project our cash cost per barrel in 2018 to decline significantly during the year as production related to Enchilada fully resumes and our cost reductions begin to be realized in the second half of the year.","In the first quarter, due to the impact of the Enchilada fire, which is estimated to shut in approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of low cost production, cash costs are projected to be $15 to $16 per barrel. We project the remaining three quarters to be lower with an average cost of $12.75 per barrel, and our fourth quarter cash cost to be below $12 per barrel as compared to pro forma cash cost of $13.09 in 2017.","DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year and first quarter of 2018 is forecast to be in the range of $18 to $19 per barrel, down from 2017 pro forma DD&A of $23.62 per barrel. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs of $31 to $33 per barrel for the full year of 2018, down from 2017 E&P pro forma unit cost of $36.71 per barrel.","Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million for the full year of 2018 and $45 million to $55 million in the first quarter of 2018. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $625 million to $650 million for the full year of 2018, which is up from 2017 Midstream tariff of $543 million due to higher Hess-operated and third-party volumes. The Midstream tariff is expected to be approximately $150 million for the first quarter of 2018.","The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 0% to 4% for the full year and first quarter of 2018 versus a pro forma benefit of 4% for the full year of 2017. As highlighted earlier, we have crude oil collars to hedge price risk for 2018 production. For 2018, we expect the non-cash premium amortization from these contracts, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices, will reduce our results by approximately $30 million per quarter.","In Midstream, in 2018, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million for the full year and approximately $25 million in the first quarter. Now, for corporate and interest, we expect corporate expenses to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million for the full year of 2018, down from $134 million in 2017 and $25 million to $30 million for the first quarter. We estimate interest expense to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million for the full year of 2018, which is higher than last year as we will not be capitalizing interest for the Stampede project, which commenced production in January. First quarter interest expense is expected to be $85 million to $90 million.","This concludes my remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess, if we could talk maybe a little bit here your performance in the Bakken. Six rigs is going to deliver growth up to the 175 level by 2021. How much more improvement in well performance is factored in on that?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Roger. As we said in our opening remarks, our new completion design, which is a 60-stage, 140,000 pounds per stage, has resulted in a 10% to 15% uplift in EUR and also IP180 rates. That 175 at 6 rigs reflects improvement from that move to that new completion design.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So solely that design, not something additional from here?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. I think we continue to optimize. We continue to look at other completion techniques. For example, we're doing some plug-and-perf pilots this year. Reason being is, as the industry has continued to improve, the limited entry perforating, in particular on plug-and-perf, is allowing a very large number of entry points with very good fracture control. And so, we're looking at that and are going to pilot some of that this year.","So, potentially, there could be a move to that. But we need to get more experience under our belt. And certainly, we know that we're going to have to do plug-and-perf outside the core. So that's why we want to really begin to experiment with that stuff.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks on that. And then, as we look at just broadly the cash flow from operations here, you referenced the Gulf of Mexico and NMB as your cash cow, so to speak. Can you frame at all kind of the expectations for cash from those operations as we think about 2018 and 2019, maybe just to kind of think about maybe a $60 oil price outlook there?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. So now with NMB coming online, our Malaysia assets are going to be significant free cash flow generators. You can see the Asian gas price that we now have. What we have in JDA is actually going to be the lowest, I guess, of the gas price because it goes back to 2016 oil prices. So we'll have that price through September 30 of 2018, and then it will increase going to 2017 prices. And then, obviously, so far in 2018, with the prices getting higher, JDA's price will continue to increase.","North Malay Basin basically only has a one-month lag on oil prices. So we are seeing the benefit of that reflected right into our gas prices in North Malay Basin. So if you looked at the number in that fourth quarter, JDA is below that average and North Malay Basin, basically, significantly above that average. So we're seeing significant free cash flow actually from the Malaysian assets in 2018. And that will continue as you move into 2019 and 2020 because we'll start slowly bringing down the capital in North Malay Basin.","As far as Bakken goes, so this year, we are actually reducing the cash flow from the Bakken a bit because we're moving to the six rigs. And as Greg said, the fifth and sixth rigs are coming in the third \u2013 one in the third quarter, one in the fourth quarter. So the wells that are drilled by the fifth and sixth rig are really not impacting production or cash flow in 2018. So we get the uplift on production and cash flow in 2019 from that. So while Bakken will be generating free cash flow, it'll give more in 2019. And then obviously with this growth that you just heard that Greg talked about, that will begin to significantly increase cash flow from the Bakken.","And then, obviously, the other piece of our business is Gulf of Mexico. It's always been a significant free cash flow generator for us. Now, Stampede is coming online, so the capital is being reduced from the prior year. We do have this deferred production which, as I guided, was about $55 million affect the cash flow in the fourth quarter. It's reasonable for you to use about $1 million a day from that being shut in, so you got 15,000 barrels a day.","So you're getting, on a half year basis, on 30,000 barrels. It is affecting us like somewhere between $180 million and $200 million in 2018. But Gulf of Mexico is going to be a significant cash flow generator as Stampede continues to ramp up, and we continue now to be actually bringing capital down there. So that's kind of how the cash flow works in our portfolio.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John, so I wonder if you could give us some idea of the cadence you're assuming on \u2013 I mean, it sounds like Enchilada is down for the first half of the year as kind of what you're assuming. But what are you assuming for the cadence for Stampede and Bakken? I'm wondering if you could give an exit rate for 2018 on both of those, please.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, Doug. Let me talk about Stampede first. We will gradually bring that production on over the year. The first piece that will come on is Penn State and Baldpate. That'll come on in the first quarter. The next thing that will come on is Llano, which is in the second quarter. And then, finally, Conger will come on towards the end of the third quarter. So that's sort of the cadence there.","So we'd pick up all that production. By certainly fourth quarter, all of that comes back on. So it'll gradually come up. And if you want kind of a quarterly impact of the Gulf of Mexico, it's about 26,000 barrels a day in the first quarter. It's about 17,000 in the second quarter. It's about 15,000 in the third quarter. So that's the cadence there.","And then, in terms of Stampede, we're going to gradually ramp that up over the next 18 months. We've got three producers capable of producing now. We'll continue to drill producers throughout the year and into 2018. So we'll gradually bring those up. And then, in the fourth quarter, Stampede will average about 10,000 barrels a day and then will continue its climb, net obviously. And then, will continue its climb in 2018 as we bring additional producers that we drill this year on production.","And I think, just overall production, I think the important thing is that we mentioned in our opening remarks, the whole increase from the first quarter to the fourth quarter, as we mentioned, our production is going to be very strong and exit the year very strong in the fourth quarter. So, in the fourth quarter, we're going to exit the year 265,000 to 275,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, whereas the first quarter 220,000 to 225,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. So that's a significant increase over the year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Just to be clear, Greg, on the Bakken, what are you assuming in there on the Bakken exit rate? I'm just wondering if you had any weather issues to impact the first quarter, given the depth you're seeing.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","No. In the first quarter, Doug, we didn't have any weather issues. Again, as Greg said, oil will be flat from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. It's above-ground NGL volumes. And what it is, is that we had some ethane rejection. And by the way, none of this impacts actually our financial results. But there was some ethane rejection that we had in the first quarter that we're having, as well as higher NGL prices. It just works the way we process our gas that when you get volumes to up to the amount of the gas processing fee. So if the prices are higher, your NGL volumes go down.","So there's no impact at all really from weather. We did see some right at the beginning. There was some difficult weather, but it didn't really impact. As you saw, we came in at the high end of the guidance in the fourth quarter. And, yes, there's some impact early on in January, but it's really not impacting our overall volumes.","And I think you asked would growing \u2013 we said the Bakken will be 115,000 to 120,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over the year. So, obviously, you start at 105,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. By the time you get to the fourth quarter, it's going to be higher than that range that we have there. So it's going to be right at that upper end of the range.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, John. My follow-up \u2013 go on. Sorry.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. 120,000 to 125,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, Doug, in the fourth quarter.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. My follow-up, Greg, is on Guyana. And I guess a couple of interrelated points, if I may. Greg, can you tell us what the implication is of the carbonate versus the strat plays you got at Ranger. Obviously, that is not yet in the 3.2 billion. Just give us an idea what you \u2013 the implications could be there.","And I guess, my follow-up would be for Mr. Hess. John, it seems that Exxon is laying out a line of sight now in development. The PSC is now public. So, what else do you need to see to reset your buyback program because it's always like the spending allocation or the requirement is going to become pretty transparent here fairly soon. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Doug. I'll go first on Ranger. So, obviously, Ranger very significant outcome for the block. Why? 230 feet of very high-quality oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. Secondly, it's located 60 miles northwest of Liza, which says that the play is working certainly in terms of charge. The play is working that far away from Liza. I think the third thing is that we see a number of additional carbonate features on the block, so that says that the carbonate system is working. Now, obviously, we've got to get wells in those eventually. But it bodes very well for the block in Guyana and potentially even Suriname as well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. John, on the \u2013 go ahead.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah \u2013 no, I'm happy to talk about your question, Doug. Look, obviously, we have an extraordinary investment opportunity in Guyana. It truly gets bigger and better. And we're delighted that Exxon Mobil announced last Friday on their quarterly call that the second FPSO would be a larger ship, 220,000 barrels a day and start production in 2022. And that would make our net working interest production from Guyana over 100,000 barrels of oil a day by 2022. And also, they announced that engineering would start on a third FPSO, and that would come on shortly thereafter Liza-2. The size of that is going to be a function of further appraisal drilling, starting with Payara that we're currently drilling right now.","So, your point is, as we get more transparency, the transparency is the capital need is going up. And so, we need to get some more definition in those costs and oil price before we would consider adding to our share repurchase program of the $500 million that's already underway. So, some more work and visibility on that. But I think the most important thing is this is a phenomenal, one of the world's best return investments in the oil industry.","And we are extremely well positioned to capitalize on it and to prefund it with the cash that we have not just for FPSO 1 but FPSO 2, and those financial returns are going to distinguish our company from many years to come. We have to be in position to capitalize on it. And that's our first, second and third priority. As the costs get a little bit more defined on FPSO 2 and the engineering for FPSO 3, serious consideration will be to add to the share repurchase program that's underway already.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks...","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Hey, Doug. Just one other comment on Guyana. If you think about Turbot, which is 30 miles south east of Liza and then you have Ranger which is 60 miles northwest of Liza, given the petroleum system is working over that entire areal extent, it also opens up other play types. It's been highly prospective in addition to the carbonate. So, there's further play types on the block as well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I wanted to follow up on a couple of the questions there earlier. First, on Guyana, when you and the operator and other partner have conversations and you see the resource that has been discovered, what, if anything, would it take to accelerate the development to have two FPSOs moving for development at the same time or for the same schedule, i.e. not necessarily in every 18 to 24 months type schedule? Is it \u2013 is there anything that could happen there? Or do you see this as more definitively every discovery that you make will be very much staged in an order on down the line?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Couple comments there, Brian. I think, first of all, we did mention that Phase 3 some further appraisal drilling is required to really define how big that's going to be. So, that's the first step. I think the second step relates to how do you very efficiently develop this massive resource in Guyana. And certainly, the view of Exxon Mobil and us and Nexen is that the right way to do it is a phased approach, where you use the same project team and the construction resources, et cetera, et cetera and really just continue to phase this development in such a way that it becomes very capital efficient to do that versus, say, three things going in parallel, right?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","And as Exxon said in their call that they're progressing concept selection for Payara and the startup there is planned for 2023 or 2024 which actually could mean 12 to 18 months from Liza Phase 2 as opposed to 24 months. So, Exxon is definitely getting more efficient in this assembly line process. And the definition of that, Brian, obviously, we need the appraisal drilling to be able to finalize what the size of that ship is going to be.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's great. And then, my follow-up is with regards to the Gulf of Mexico. I'm trying to piece together some of the moving pieces of the Stampede and then the Enchilada platform but also get your sense of whether there's been any changes in the underlying decline rate in the Gulf and what that is. And I think, in response to an earlier question, you threw out some numbers of 26,000, 17,000 and 15,000 maybe in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter. I wondered is that total production that's falling in Q2 and Q3 versus Q1 or just maybe I missed those numbers? Thanks.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. Thanks for the clarification question, Brian. What that was the impact of the Enchilada fire on Hess Gulf of Mexico production quarter-by-quarter. So, again, it's 26,000 barrels a day off production on average in Q1, it's 17,000 barrels a day on average in Q2 and then 15,000 barrels a day on average in Q3. And that reflects the cadence that I talked about, where Baldpate and Penn State come on in the first quarter, Llano comes on the second quarter and then, finally, Conger, the last piece, comes on in the third quarter. So, that's what that reflects.","And then, the other piece of the equation in the Gulf of Mexico is Stampede. As I've said, that's going to gradually ramp up over 18 months. We just started first oil in January. We're going to ramp those wells up very slowly. That's been a big learning for industry that you need to bring these on very slowly. And we will average in the fourth quarter some-10,000 barrels a day. So, that kind of gives you how the trajectory of the Gulf of Mexico will go. The rest, decline is very shallow. So, decline is not a big factor in the Gulf of Mexico this year.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Actually, the prior question hit on a number of mine. But just final \u2013 I guess one more final follow-up on Stampede. Can you just remind me what do you think the kind of peak production profile Stampede would look like and when you'll reach that?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Michael, so it's early days. And what we'd like to do is get some dynamic data on these wells before we be as specific as what we think the peak rate will be. As I've said, we will ramp this up over the next 18 months. So, as we get that dynamic data, see what the wells are going to do \u2013 we just started this thing in January. Then, we'll be able to give some more definitive guidance on peak rates.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Fair enough. That's really all I have at the moment. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple for me. I mean, as you talked about the modernization process for the assets in Denmark, as you look across the rest of the portfolio, are you happy with the current state of the portfolio? Would you consider selling any of the Asian assets or are you in a position where you could consider to farming down Guyana at all? Or is there still too much undiscovered resource at this point?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Obviously, we've been pretty active optimizing our portfolio. We have an open mind. We're always there to maximize value. We have a long-term strategy in portfolio that we and the board worked on to have the cash generators along with the growth engines in Guyana and the Bakken. So, we will always have an open mind to maximize value as we've shown in the past.","Having said that, the major focus for the company is to capitalize on the amazing investment opportunity we have in Guyana and the Bakken. And to do that, we got to have a strong balance sheet and cash. We don't have a funding deficit. We pre-fund it. And as Guyana gets bigger and better with FPSO 2 now being defined and FPSO 3 and, by the way, a pretty active exploration and appraisal program, we've got to make sure we have the cash for that. So, our focus is much more on Guyana and in funding the world-class investment opportunity and the high finance returns there.","To sell part of that would not be the right thing for our shareholders because that is probably the best investment return certainly in Hess' portfolio and one of the best in the industry. And if we could get more of it, we would. But selling it would be the wrong thing to do.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. That's very helpful. And maybe one follow-up on the Bakken. I mean, clearly, very strong well results. Can you clarify \u2013 I think did you say that the drilling program in 2018 would have an average EUR per well of over 1 million barrels? And do you have an estimate of what the average per well EUR will be across the 1,780 high rate of return inventory that you talked about?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","So, let me start with the 2018 program. Yes, you're correct. So, the average EUR this year will be north of 1 million. Average IPA \u2013 IP 180, so this is cumulative now, is north of 100,000 barrels of oil. And then, also, if you \u2013 what in our portfolio do we think can generate over 1 million barrels a day or 1 million barrels of EUR? There's about 500 or so wells in our portfolio that can do that with our current completion design of 60-stage 140,000 pounds. That's substantially from where it was last year as a result of moving to that better completion design.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Greg, when you give the production guidance, is that built in some timeline \u2013 the time that asset sales is going to be done? Or...","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","What we have...","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","(01:03:39) the production is in there?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So, Paul, in the pro forma numbers that we gave for 2017 of the 242,000 barrels a day, that \u2013 we only took out the assets sold. So, Denmark is in there, and we have Denmark in our production guidance next year. So, if you wanted to take 10,000 barrels out of the 242,000, drop it to 232,000 and if you could take 10,000 barrels out of our 2018 production...","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay...","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","If you were just doing a comparison. So, I just want to make sure when everybody looks at that, that our pro forma of 242,000, our midpoint right now is between the 245,000 and 255,000 is 250,000. If you add the Enchilada effect to the 265,000, we're getting to that 10% pro forma growth that Greg had talked about that will continue into 2020.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And, John, when you take the weight down on Stampede and Tubular Bells you say is based on the lower commodity prices. Can you share with us what price that you're using? I mean, is that really significantly down? I mean \u2013 so, what kind of carrying costs you still have in those two?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","So, we \u2013 I'm not going to be specific exactly on our \u2013 on the crude oil price outlook that we have and went through with the board. But let's just start with what we are doing from a management standpoint of the business. So, from a management standpoint of business, as we said, we are managing to $50 and being able to generate free cash flow at $50 post the Guyana start-up, and we are well on our way on track for that.","So, again, with this pro forma production growth, 10% per year, plus our cash costs, as I said, by the fourth quarter going under $12. So, by 2020, we'll have our cash costs down to $10 and, again, now generating that free cash flow. So, as it relates to, just in general, where we're going with our cost reductions, we'll start getting that in the second half of the year. We're going to even get then the full annualized effect in 2019. And then, that will drop our cash costs per barrel even lower as we move into 2019.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","John, on the $150 million of the cost reduction, where are they going to show up the most? Is it in the corporate item or just in the upstream operating cost or what line item that you're going to see the benefit?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","What you saw \u2013 if you noted in my guidance for corporate. So, what you see actually in 2018 already is about a $24 million reduction in our corporate expenses, if you just take the midpoint of our corporate guidance. So, we're beginning to get that impact right now in corporate. We're going to have severance charges. There'll be pension settlement charges. So with things like that going through. But what I would tell you in general, by the time we get to the end of this, about two-thirds of the savings just \u2013 I'm using round numbers, Paul \u2013 is going to be labor-based and then the one-third is going to be the other operating cost that I talked about.","So that labor base will go between corporate E&P and also within operating costs in production and even within exploration G&A, too, as well. So it's going to be spread throughout kind of the line items that we have in our financial statements.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Can you tell us that what is the Stampede and Tubular Bells \u2013 the cash operating cost may look like this year and also by year 2020?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So, for Stampede, as Greg said, there will be this slow ramp, right? So cash cost per barrel will not be obviously at its regular operating level at the beginning. So cash cost will be a little bit higher. But just like all Gulf of Mexico fields, Stampede itself is going to be below $10 as that is, as Greg said, when you get to the fourth quarter and you get that up to the 10,000 barrels a day. So, again, Gulf of Mexico is always a good low-cost operating environment.","Tubular Bells is just a little bit higher. And we said because we've leased that facility. So that's the one unique asset you have in the Gulf of Mexico. So Tubular Bells is above $10 for that. But that will hold steady at that rate.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And two final one for me. One, on the hedging, you haven't extended any additional hedging into 2019, right? In 2018, are we still talking about 150,000 barrel per day or that has also been changed?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Okay. So there is no...","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And I am wondering if you can comment on Ghana, what have changed and lead you to, say, make the decision not to develop?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. So from the hedging standpoint, just confirming your point that, in 2019, we have not added any hedges in 2019 with the backwardation basically in the curve. So for 2018, it is unchanged. It is in the back of the release. It's 115,000 barrels per day, correct, that we have the collars on in 2018.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yes. And, Paul, in terms of Ghana, it's a good asset. There's oil there. But our strategy is to invest in the highest return projects, be capital disciplined and committed to being cash flow generative at a $50 Brent price post 2020, as Liza Phase 1 comes on. And, quite frankly, that project, while a good project, just can't compete for capital relative to the other investment opportunities we have. So, as a consequence, we're currently looking at options to monetize our Ghana asset.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Quick question. I was just wondering if you could just help us bridge the production forecasts for the other segments. You talked about 105,000 barrels a day in the first quarter for the Bakken. I'm assuming that your guidance implies about 30,000 barrels a day for the Gulf of Mexico. And I was just wondering if you can help us think about the Utica U.S. \u2013 other U.S. onshore, as well as Asia for Q1?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","If you're trying to bridge, let's just say, the fourth quarter number to our first quarter number, the biggest change is obviously asset sales. So the 282,000 barrels a day, if you take 41,000 barrels a day approximately as it relates to the asset sales, you have to take that off. Then, as Greg mentioned, we've got 26,000 barrels a day off on Enchilada versus the 17,000 barrels a day that we have. So you have to take another 9,000 barrels a day off. You've picked up the Bakken, right? So that's 5,000 barrels down. Utica will have a decline. So we have Utica declining approximately 3,000 barrels a day in the first quarter from the fourth quarter.","As you probably saw it in our capital release, we will be completing some DUCs that we have, and that won't come in until really the end of the year. You won't see that in the Utica until fourth quarter production. So with that, you basically bridge the difference between the fourth quarter and first quarter.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. And, John, just to follow up on the NGL commentary you made in the Bakken, could you just maybe help us understand that a little bit better? Is that just going to affect 1Q, or is there any effect as we think about the full year in terms of the Bakken?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Okay. So first thing I have to say, there is no effect on our bottom line for these two items. So the first one is our buyer who takes our ethane, can execute and can reject ethane based on whatever pricing that they're getting and what benefits from their standpoint. However, they do have to pay us the economic amount of that ethane that we would have produced. So, again, just from a pure volume standpoint, we'll just have less ethane volumes flowing through our NGLs in the first quarter. So that's one. And basically that's going to go away and come right back on.","The second one is the increase in NGL pricing. So just think about it as you've got a set gas processing fee, and it only works on some of the contracts that we have. And then you've probably heard POP contracts, or percentage of proceeds contracts. So what we get is actual NGL volumes to satisfy that gas processing fee.","So as NGL prices go up, you just get less volumes. You get the same amount from your gas processing fee, but you just get less volumes to satisfy it. So as prices have come up from the fourth quarter, that's affecting that number. If prices stay the same or go down, you will get some fluctuations above ground. It shouldn't be big. It's not going to be a big effect. And again, as we said, Bakken, the real key is we'll be adding wells a little bit more towards the latter part of the first quarter and then just driving through the year and increasing Bakken quarter-on-quarter.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys. Few weeks ago, the fiscal terms of the Guyana production sharing agreement were published. And I suppose, for those investors who might look at that and say, how can a deepwater project have a breakeven oil price below $40 a barrel? What are the key attributes of those fiscal terms that are contributing to that low breakeven?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Okay. So it's really all the attributes and you have to \u2013 not even just the fiscal terms, so let me just start with Guyana overall. So our Liza find that we have, the geology, the reservoirs are just fantastic. The permeability is fantastic. The size \u2013 obviously, you've seen the scale. So that plays into getting that low to breakeven. The next thing, as you compare, let's just say the other basins around the world, the depths that you drill to in Guyana are much shallower; and the other thing is there's no salt. So from an imaging standpoint, that helps; and then there is less casing strings. So the exploration wells and the development wells obviously just cost less, I mean, clearly as you would compare, let's say, to like a Gulf of Mexico-type aspect.","We're also in the low point in the cycle from offshore. So, again, yards are looking for work, rigs are looking for work. So all the costs that Exxon is getting for our developments are just hitting this, obviously, at the right point in the cycle. And then it's just a blend of the fiscal terms. So you have a production-sharing contract. So just start with any production-sharing contract. It gives you downside protection. That's what it's set up for to encourage investment from oil companies. So as oil prices go lower, you get more barrels because you get the cost recover from that standpoint. So again, as prices go down and giving you that breakeven, you get that production-sharing cost impact.","And then, the terms are out there. They're on the government website for people to see. And that along with just the unique attributes of the Guyana Basin, in general, allow you to get this really low breakeven cost.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Let me ask a quick follow-up about the dividend. One of your well-known shareholders has called for a dividend cut or elimination and the proceeds deployed towards more share buyback. Should I take it as a given that you are ruling out that scenario?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. I think what you should take as a feedback is that we talk to all of our shareholders, and a number of our shareholders put a high degree of importance on that dividend as a show of confidence in our future and our ability to generate cash. So we talk to all our shareholders. We have ongoing communications with all of our shareholders. And there are other views about the dividend than that one shareholder you were referring to.","Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Your line is now open.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yeah. Hi. Just two quick ones on Guyana. When we were out in December, John, you had mentioned or Greg had mentioned that possibly you would buy the FPSO for Liza 2. Is that still the case? And then, the other question is on Ranger. It took longer to reach TD in the carbonate well. Obviously, it was a cautious drill. But how much faster do you think the drilling would be for carbonate play?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So, let me answer the Ranger question first. Yes, it was a very cautious drill. John, as you know, carbonates can be very tricky. But we didn't discover any of the downsides in the drilling of this well that potentially could have been there. So I think certainly on the next appraisal well of Ranger, we anticipate the drilling time will improve and the cost will be lower obviously.","Regarding the boat on Phase 2, that decision has not been made. But certainly, from a financial standpoint, it's better to purchase these things ultimately just so you don't have to pay the uplift on the lease cost, right? So, I think we're aligned with the operator that ultimately you'd want to purchase these things, but that decision has not been made.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. Great. With Guyana, are you opening a data room? And that's it for me.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Yeah. The Guyana process is ongoing, and I wouldn't want to comment further on that.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect.

My name is Stephanie, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements.","These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.","Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.","With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President and COO; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will provide some key highlights on the quarter and the progress we are making executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then review our operations, and John Rielly will go over our financial results.","With the sale of our Retail business, which was announced in May, we have essentially completed our transformation to a pure-play E&P company. We have built a focused, balanced portfolio of low-risk, high-margin growth assets, and we are well positioned to deliver 5% to 8% compound average annual production growth through 2017 from our 2012 pro forma base and to generate free cash flow after 2014 based upon a $100 Brent.","With regard to our financial results for the second quarter of 2014, net income was $931 million or $432 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted net income per share was $1.38 compared to $1.51 in the year-ago quarter. Cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital, was $1.3 billion.","Compared with the second quarter of 2013, our results were impacted by asset sales, which reduced production by 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the shut-in of production in Libya, which reduced production by 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Net production in the second quarter averaged 319,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a pro forma basis, excluding divestitures. This represents an increase of 17% from pro forma production of 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the year-ago quarter, excluding Libya.","Our production growth is underpinned by 5 key areas: the Bakken in North Dakota, the Utica Shale play in Ohio, Tubular Bells in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Valhall Field in Norway and North Malay Basin in Malaysia. Let's look at highlights from the quarter for these growth assets.","Starting onshore, net production in the Bakken averaged 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up 25% from second quarter of 2013, following the successful startup of the expanded Tioga gas plant. We project net Bakken production for the third quarter to average between 85,000 and 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we are on track to deliver our full year 2014 production forecast of 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","At the same time, our Bakken team continues to drive our well costs lower. In the second quarter, drilling and completion cost averaged $7.4 million, down 12% from the year-ago quarter. As we have said before, our goal is to deliver the highest value wells, and our results continue to demonstrate that we are consistently delivering wells with some of the highest returns in the Bakken.","In the Utica, we and our partner, CONSOL, have a premier acreage position in the wet gas window featuring highly productive wells with high liquids content and high net revenue interests, which will enable us to generate strong financial returns. During the quarter, we continued delineating the play, and well results remain encouraging. While current production is fairly low at this stage, the Utica asset is positioned to be a material contributor to our production growth over the next 5 years.","Moving to our offshore assets in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Final commissioning of the Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess has a 57% interest and is operator, is currently underway. We expect Tubular Bells to achieve first production in September and to deliver net production of approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day following the ramp-up period.","Regarding the Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% working interest, net production averaged 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. This compares to 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter when production was ramping up following completion of the multiyear field redevelopment project. Our full year net production forecast remains 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Valhall is a long-life material resource that generates significant free cash flow and offers potential in terms of unbooked reserves and production growth.","In Malaysia, net production from the North Malay Basin, where Hess is the operator with a 50% interest, averaged 42 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter. The Early Production System commenced in October 2013 and is expected to maintain production at current levels through 2016.","During the quarter, we continued to progress full field development, which should result in net production increasing to 160 million cubic feet per day in 2017. Our natural gas assets in the Gulf of Thailand, which include North Malay Basin and the Malaysia\/Thailand Joint Development Area or JDA, are material, long-life assets with oil-linked pricing and exploratory upside. Combining our North Malay Basin production with that of the JDA, we anticipate that net production will reach 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day beginning in 2017 compared with 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013.","In terms of overall company production, we are on track to deliver our 2014 pro forma production forecast of 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This would be up between 13% and 17% from 2013 pro forma production of 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first half of 2014 were $2.5 billion, which was down 23% from the first half of 2013. This decline reflects both improved capital efficiency and increased activity planned for the second half of the year in the Bakken, as well as the impact of asset sales. We continue to project 2014 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $5.8 billion.","In terms of divestitures, we reached a major milestone in the second quarter with the agreement to sell our Retail business for a total consideration of $2.9 billion. The transaction is scheduled to close before the end of the year. In addition, we completed asset sales totaling $1.6 billion during the second quarter, comprising the sale of our Exploration and Production assets in Thailand; the sale of our 50% interest in a joint venture power plant under construction in Newark, New Jersey; and an additional 30,000 acres, including related wells and facilities in the Utica dry gas window.","The divestiture process for our Hetco Energy trading business is also ongoing. We continue to make progress in our plans to monetize our Bakken midstream infrastructure in 2015 through an MLP structure, which will allow Hess to retain operational control while realizing additional value from our infrastructure investment. As we announced today, we expect to file our initial Form S-1 with the SEC in the fourth quarter this year.","Based upon the sale of our Retail business, we increased our share repurchase authorization to $6.5 billion from $4 billion. Year-to-date through July 29, we have repurchased 23.3 million shares for $2 billion. Since commencement of the program in August of 2013, we have repurchased 42.6 million shares for $3.5 billion. We will continue to implement this program in a disciplined manner and provide quarterly updates on future conference calls.","In closing, we are delivering strong performance and executing well against our plan to drive cash-generative growth and sustainable returns for our shareholders through a focused, balanced portfolio of world-class E&P assets. We are excited about the future we are building, and look forward to talking more about our portfolio and growth prospects at our Investor Day, which will take place on November 10 in Houston.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory P. Hill","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide additional details on the execution of our strategy. In the second quarter, we again demonstrated continuing strong delivery against plan.","Starting with unconventionals. In the second quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from 63,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2014. In the second quarter, approximately 30% of our operated oil was produced from the Three Forks, and some 30% of our wells were completed in the Three Forks. This demonstrates the high quality of our acreage position in the Three Forks, as well as the Middle Bakken.","First gas was introduced to the Tioga gas processing plant on March 23. First residue gas sales commenced on March 25 and ethane recovery on April 23. The plant will be a major enabler for us to reduce flaring to less than 10% by 2017.","Plant gross inlet capacity has increased to 250 million cubic feet per day, and natural gas liquids processing capacity has more than doubled to approximately 50,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day. Current plant gross inlet volumes are approximately 180 million cubic feet per day, and we are processing approximately 35,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day of natural gas liquids.","Looking forward, we intend to debottleneck the plant to enable processing of up to 300 million cubic feet per day. In the second quarter, we operated 17 rigs and brought 53 Bakken wells online compared to 30 wells in the first quarter. Our plan is to bring a further 140 to 150 wells online over the course of the second half of this year.","In the third quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 85,000 and 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and our full year 2014 Bakken production guidance remains at 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Drilling and completion cost continue to be reduced with the second quarter averaging $7.4 million per well versus $8.4 million per well in the year-ago quarter and $7.5 million per well in the first quarter of this year. We continue to make significant progress in drilling cycle time improvements. Compared to the year-ago quarter, we have seen a 19% decrease in spud-to-spud days, which leads not only to lower drilling cost, but also accelerates production. This continuing cost reduction, coupled with the above-average productivity of our wells, means we are delivering some of the highest returns in the Bakken play to our shareholders.","Our 13 and 17 well per DSU down spacing pilots are progressing well and performing in line with expectations. These pilots are critical for us to determine optimal spacing across play. By the end of this year, we expect to have sufficient data to provide updated guidance for well spacing, production, forward drilling location and estimated recoverable resources.","In the Utica, the divestment of our 100% owned dry gas acreage to American Energy Partners is allowing us to focus on a more profitable wet gas area of the play. The appraisal and early development of our 43,000 core net acres in the Hess-CONSOL joint venture continues to be encouraging. In the second quarter, the joint venture drilled 10 wells, completed 11 and tested 5. So in total, the joint venture has now drilled 52 wells, completed 37 and tested 20 since inception in 2012.","Results on our recent Cadiz B wells in Harrison County are particularly encouraging with rates of up to 3,450 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 51% to 53% liquids based on 24-hour test.","Turning to offshore. Progress continues in Tubular Bells, North Malay Basin and Valhall. At our 57% owned and operated Tubular Bells development in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we remain on time and on budget. We have completed wells A, B and D and remain on target for field startup in September 2014. We expect net production to build to approximately 25,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day within 8 weeks of first oil.","Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stampede development project, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we continue to progress, and project sanction is expected later this year. Stampede is a Miocene development that will build on the successful execution of our Tubular Bells project.","At the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess holds a 50% working interest and is operator, second quarter net production averaged 42 million cubic feet per day through the Early Production System. Regarding the fuel field development project, we signed a gas sales agreement with the Malaysian government, awarded contracts for the construction and installation of the central processing platform and for wellhead platforms, and we progressed construction of a gas export system. Upon completion of full field development in early 2017, net production is expected to increase to 160 million cubic feet per day.","At the BP-operated Valhall Field in Norway, in which Hess has a 64% interest, second quarter production was reduced by approximately 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to the first quarter. This is primarily due to a temporary reduction of south flank production due to a mechanical problem now resolved and the need to shut in the G4 producer during well G3 drilling operations. G3 has now finished drilling, and we expect G4 will be restarted in August. We expect full year production guidance for Valhall to remain unchanged at 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Looking ahead to the third quarter. Planned seasonal maintenance shutdowns are scheduled this summer at our Gulf of Mexico and North Sea assets, which, combined, are expected to reduce third quarter production by approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Company-wide production, on a pro forma basis and excluding Libya, is forecast to average between 300,000 and 305,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter of 2014. Our full year 2014 forecast on the same basis remains unchanged at 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Moving to exploration. In Kurdistan, where Hess has a 64% interest, the Shakrok-1 well encountered noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons and was plugged and abandoned. We are currently drilling the Shireen-1 well on the Dinarta block, where we expect to drill and complete testing by year-end 2014.","In Ghana, in the second quarter, Hess and its partners commenced drilling a 3-well appraisal program. The first well, Pecan 2A, was completed in June, and the second well, Pecan 3A, was drilled and logged, and we are now preparing to production test the well. The third well, which will appraise the Almond discovery, is expected to be drilled on the third quarter. By year end, following completion of the appraisal program, we will provide an update on results and our forward plans.","In closing, this quarter is yet another demonstration of strong execution against our plan and on-target delivery of key milestones.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thanks, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2014.","The corporation generated consolidated net income of $931 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $386 million in the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted net income was $432 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $446 million in the previous quarter. E&P had income of $1,057,000,000 in the second quarter and $508 million in the first quarter of 2014. E&P adjusted net income was $483 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $514 million in the previous quarter.","The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted net income were as follows. Higher sales volumes for crude oil and NGLs, partially offset by lower gas volumes, increased net income by $71 million. Changes in realized selling prices increased net income by $7 million. Higher cash cost decreased net income by $54 million. Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased net income by $43 million. Higher exploration expenses decreased net income by $39 million. All other items led to an increase in net income of $27 million for an overall decrease in second quarter adjusted net income of $31 million.","Our E&P crude oil operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 550,000 barrels in the quarter, which increased after-tax income by approximately $25 million. We currently expect an under-lift of approximately 500,000 barrels in the third quarter.","In the second quarter, the corporation added 10,000 barrels per day of Brent crude oil hedges for a total of 40,000 barrels per day for the remainder of 2014 at an average price of $109.17 per barrel. In addition, during the second quarter, the corporation added 20,000 barrels per day of WTI crude oil hedges for the remainder of 2014 at an average price of $100.41 per barrel.","The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, was 34% for the second quarter and 39% in the first quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting the mix of earnings.","Turning to corporate. Corporate and interest expenses, net of income taxes, were $91 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $89 million in the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted corporate and interest expenses were $82 million in the second quarter and $81 million in the first quarter.","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter, including a decrease of $368 million from changes in working capital, was $946 million. Net proceeds from asset sales were $1,610,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,214,000,000. Common stock acquired and retired amounted to $692 million. Net borrowings amounted to $431 million. Common stock dividends paid were $77 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $52 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $952 million.","Turning to our stock repurchase program. During the second quarter, we announced an increase in our existing share repurchase program to $6.5 billion from $4 billion. We also purchased in the quarter approximately 8.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $768 million or $91.85 per share, bringing cumulative purchases for the program through June 30, 2014, to 40.2 million shares at a cost of $3.3 billion or $82.09 per share.","We've continued to buy back our common stock. And through July 29, total program to date purchases were 42.6 million shares at a cost of $3.5 billion or $83.03 per share. We had $2,240,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2014, compared with $1,814,000,000 at the end of last year. Total debt was $6,077,000,000 at June 30, 2014, up from $5,798,000,000 at December 31, 2013.","In June, the corporation issued $600 million of notes, comprised of $300 million of 1.3% notes due in June 2017 and $300 million of 3.5% notes due in July 2024. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at June 30, 2014 was 20% and 19% at the end of 2013.","Turning to the 2014 guidance. I would like to provide estimates for certain metrics. For the third quarter, E&P cash operating cost per barrel of oil equivalent are estimated to be in the range of $22.50 to $23.50. And E&P depreciation, depletion and amortization per barrel of oil equivalent are expected to be in a range of $29 to $30. Full year 2014 guidance is now expected to be $21.50 to $22.50 per barrel for cash operating cost, and $28 to $29 per barrel for depreciation, depletion and amortization. Total production unit cost for the full year of $49.50 to $51.50 per barrel remains unchanged.","The third quarter E&P effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 33% to 35%, and the full year 2014 rate is now expected to be in the range of 36% to 40%, down from our previous guidance of 37% to 41%. Third quarter corporate expenses are expected to be between $30 million and $35 million after taxes. And after-tax interest expenses are expected to be in a range of $55 million to $60 million. The estimate for corporate expenses in 2014 remains in the range of $125 million to $135 million after taxes, and after-tax interest expenses are now estimated to be in the range of $215 million to $225 million, down from our previous guidance of $225 million to $235 million.","Turning to midstream. As we announced earlier this morning, we are pursuing the formation of a master limited partnership for our Bakken midstream assets. We expect to file an initial registration statement with the SEC in the fourth quarter. The SEC imposes restrictions on communications when a securities offering is in process. We are, therefore, limited in the information that we can share with you at this time, and we will not be able to answer questions about future plans and expectations for the MLP on this call. As we move to the offering process towards an IPO, we will continue to be restricted in the information that we can give you other than the information provided in the registration statement.","This concludes my remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","[indiscernible] and good results. My question is on the Bakken and Hess' approach to completion design and technological change. First, I mean, have you experimented or do you plan to experiment with coiled tubing completion technologies in the Bakken? I know a few others are beginning to use these completions, and Schlumberger recently highlighted at its Analyst Day the potential to significantly improve frac effectiveness via those completions. And I have a follow-up, please.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Evan, thanks for the question. In fact, I just had a review of that yesterday. So yes, we are planning to deploy some coiled tubing completions and give it a try.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And any -- I mean, I just hop [ph] on any other variables that you're experimenting with and in the process there in isolating whether it's completion variables, well design variables or being a kind of faster adopter to change? I mean, can you just talk about your approach there as things continue to rapidly change?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. I think first of all, our current standard design is 35 stages now. That's compared to 29 last year. So we've upped our stage count. So we've also upped our sand loading a bit to around 100,000 pounds per stage. We just continue to learn and watch and try new things to see what the best approach is, pay close attention to what competitors are doing as well and then try -- and to try some of those things on our own and see what the results show us. So...","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And slick water fracs? I mean, any kind of potential there to limit decline rates?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we're evaluating that as well, the slick water. We haven't run one yet, but we're going to do that.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. That's great. And then maybe lastly for me, I mean, the Analyst Day is a new announcement. I know it's been a while since you had one. I know there's been significant portfolio changes. What drives your decision? What does the Street not understand about the Hess story in your view? And I'll leave it at that.","John B. Hess","Well, we wanted to get the portfolio restructuring to a pure-play E&P behind us and with the announcement of the retail sale in May and God willing, Tubular Bells ramping up, and Bakken ramping up, and Utica ramping up, we thought it would be a good time to give an update on the performance of our assets in deeper detail, as well as some of the exciting investment growth opportunities we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Baber with Simmons & Company.","Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I had 2 on production. One, near term and then one longer-term question. So I wanted to talk a little bit about the 3Q guidance. You mentioned 300,000 to 305,000 barrels a day pro forma, which looks a little conservative even in light of the 20,000 barrels a day of maintenance that you called out just considering that you should get back some significant JDA maintenance from last quarter and then you have Bakken ramping up. Are there any other negative offsets in the 3Q number that we need to be thinking of? And was the maintenance really kind of what keeps you leaving your full year guidance unchanged, considering you guys have outperformed 1Q and then outperformed 2Q and things seem to be ramping according to plan? And then I have a follow-up after that.","Gregory P. Hill","Okay. Yes, I think the maintenance is a routine. It was part of our forecast. So if you look at kind of a walk down between second quarter and third quarter pro forma guidance, as mentioned, the Bakken, we plan an increase there, but the -- all of the offset to that is the maintenance shutdowns that we talked about in the Gulf of Mexico and in the North Sea. So there's no other thing going on other than maintenance and being partially offset by the Bakken.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then on -- my follow-up is on longer term, your E&P production guidance. You mentioned that the Bakken, Utica, Valhall and North Malay Basin are really the major assets that underpin that longer-term growth, and you've given us a pretty specific framework around how to think about the contribution from all of those assets aside from the Utica. So I was hoping you could just provide a little bit more color around how we should be thinking about that multi-year ramp in the Utica, and kind of what type of volumes you think you could deliver there? Or is that something that we'll need to wait for, for the Analyst Day?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think, again, we're continuing the appraisal program in the Utica, and our plans would be to, certainly by the end of the year, to give much more visibility on the forward growth plans for the Utica. But again, we're very encouraged by what we see in the Utica.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got 2 questions, if I may. One for Greg and one for John, if that's okay. Greg, the supplemental information you said during the call here, and it looks like the average 30-day rates of the wells you brought on in the second quarter were quite a bit up and have been trending higher over the last, I guess, 6 quarters or so. There was also a just slight change in the mix towards Three Forks well, it seems. I'm just wondering if you could help us connect the dots as to what's happening there that might be driving that improvement, and whether or not you think it's sustainable. I've got a follow-up, please.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think, Doug, it's related to 2 factors. One is increasing the stage count. So our standard design now is 35. In the quarter, we showed 33. That's because we had a few wells where we used lower-stage counts intentionally and some 6 40 patterns. But the average IP for the quarter was over 1,000, and that was driven by -- there were over 20 new wells in the quarter that averaged well over 1,000 barrels a day. 15 of those were Middle Bakken, and 5 were Three Forks. So it's a mix of where we're drilling but also the higher stage counts. So I think certainly, from the higher stage counts, that is sustainable, but rates will creep up relative to historic. Obviously, the mix will change as you kind of move around the field.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I understand. John, my other question's a capital expenditure question because, this year, I seem to recall you had about $400 million on TD [ph] and a bit on midstream and now that you have obviously announced the MLP and TD goes away, I'm assuming that the CapEx same-store sales kind of thing would be lower next year unless you step up activities. So given that you're in a very strong growth trajectory in the second half of the year, have to imagine cash flow doesn't go up. So my question is, how do you think about the use of that free cash flow? Will buybacks only add through proceeds from asset sales? In other words, with operating cash flow, should we realistically think that, that goes to organic growth and perhaps a step up in the Bakken, given your positive results from your down-spacing?","John P. Rielly","So thanks, Doug. And yes, I mean, so now as you begin to see the Tubular Bells comes on, Bakken continues to ramp, Utica begins to grow. So obviously, there's some nice cash margins coming in, and our cash flow will continue to grow as this production increases. And to your point on where we are with our portfolio, and we haven't laid out where capital is going to be next year. But as we said, we are looking to become free cash flow positive post 2014 with Brent prices that stay at least $100. And so where we are from a focus on our free cash flow generation is that we are focusing on executing that strategy to profitably grow those -- that production in reserves to generate that cash flow and generate hopefully enhanced shareholder value. And then we'll continue to allocate capital to growth opportunities that offer the highest risk adjust returns, but we'll be balancing those investments in the business with current returns to shareholders. So it's not just asset sale proceeds.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So to be clear, John, previously I believe you've said that sales proceeds would fund buybacks. So should we look for organic cash flow to fund buybacks or would that be more skewed towards dividend? I'm just trying to understand if you're changing your position a little bit on the use of operating cash flow.","John P. Rielly","So where we are right now in the strategic transformation that we went through? Yes, it was the proceeds and basically an excess cash flow from the proceeds. We were utilizing those to buy back shares. But as we get past that, and now we're in our -- that was a nonrecurring cash flow that came in, and we used that proceeds for that. When we get to the organic cash flow, yes, that can be balanced, and we'll be looking for the high-risk returns that we have within the portfolio, and we'll balance the use of that cash flow for that with current returns to shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Unknown Analyst","This is Zack Dushane [ph] standing in for Ed right now. So couple of questions, first regarding the Bakken. We've seen some good results from Blue Buttes and Hawkeye up in McKenzie County, and I know you guys have touched on this a little bit. We're trying to understand is the uplift from new completion technology used here that isn't used elsewhere? Or do you see it more as a geology sort of focus? So you could just address that and I have a quick follow-on.","Gregory P. Hill","Well, again, it's both in the quarter. So certainly, where we are drilling matters. We are drilling in some good sweet spots right now, both for the Three Forks and for the Middle Bakken. And then as I said, with the stage counts going up and proppant loadings going up a bit, that's obviously contributed to higher IP rates. So it's really a mix of both geology and completion design.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So your new techniques are being used kind of across the board? It's not...","Gregory P. Hill","They are. Yes. Our standard design now is 35 stages.","Unknown Analyst","Right. Right. And then just a follow-up unrelated. So, and sorry if this was addressed before. Where do you guys see the peak production from the Tubular Bells?","Gregory P. Hill","Well, I think what we said in our opening remarks is that we'll bring 3 wells on at first oil. We'll ramp those over a period of about 8 weeks. Gulf of Mexico experience shows that you need to ramp them up slowly so you don't get sand influx. And we think that, that will -- once we get those 3 wells up, we'll be around 25,000 barrels a day and hopefully, there's a little bit upside to that number. But right now, we're quoting 25,000 barrels a day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could follow up on the Bakken, and maybe it's a slightly more focused way of looking at the earlier questions on use of cash, but what's the right way to think about your management of the pace of development on the Bakken? I realize you won't have down-spacing results until later this year, but a high-level -- what are the governing factors in terms of your Bakken development? Is inventory a governing factor? Is it cash flow, infrastructure and logistics, some or all of the above? And if inventory goes up via down-spacing, does that necessarily increase your long-term activity levels?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So first of all, once we are complete with the results of all the down spacing pilots by year end, we'll update guidance on pace and recover reserves, all the things that we talked about in our opening remarks. I think the main objective that we're trying to accomplish in the Bakken is to maximize asset value, and that is a function of pace and infrastructure build-out. So we're constantly trying to manage those 2 dimensions to ensure that we maximize ultimate NPV from the Bakken development, because you can go really fast and over build infrastructure that you don't need, and so we're really trying to optimize based on those 2 dimensions to maximize value from the asset.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And then if I could ask one quick one on the Utica as well. I mean, is it -- I'm not sure if it showed up in the supplemental data or if you said, but did you say what the current production -- or could you say what the current production in the Utica is? And maybe talk a little bit about the marketing of your gas, what you have in the way of firm transport and your kind of your medium-term expectation on pricing out of the basin?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think in Q2, we produced around 3,000 barrels a day from the Utica. That's our JV acreage with CONSOL. And in Q3, we expect to double that to approximately 6,000 barrels a day and then continue to build through the end of the year. And as we mentioned before, we plan to provide additional data and forecast later in the year on our outlook for the Utica. As far as the gas, we have dedicated third-party contracts in place for 2014 and negotiating new wins for expanding volumes, and we don't expect any bottlenecks or issues. Regarding NGLs and pricing and all that, revenues received by us are on realized spot market prices in the surrounding areas.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And have you signed long-term contracts on the gas side?","Gregory P. Hill","No, we haven't.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wells Research.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Back to the Bakken, I had a couple of questions. The first is fairly specific, and then the second is a high-level question. The specific question is on the Tioga plant and the impact it had on your liquids cut. You've beaten our estimates there. Can we assume that, that cut continues to rise as the plant ramps up? And how much higher can we expect that to go?","Gregory P. Hill","I'd just kind of highlight what the Tioga gas plant has done to us in terms of increased capacity. So on the inlet side, the plant can currently process about 250 million cubic feet per day gross on the inlet side. It also -- the expansion increased our liquids processing capability to some 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And if you look at what we're putting through the plant today, it's about 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross liquids. So you can see that there's further upside beyond that as we expand to plan capacity. Importantly, we also intend to debottleneck the plant to take the inlet capacity up to 300 million cubic feet a day. So we can see our way to another 50 million coming in at the plant, and we have the liquids capacity to deal with that.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","And would that then be another potential expansion beyond that debottlenecking?","Gregory P. Hill","That'll be a question I think for the MLP in the future to decide.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","That's what I was driving at without mentioning MLPs. The high-level question is now that you focused the company more towards the Bakken and it's become so important for the story, can you just remind us what your -- what you believe your competitive advantage is? What makes you as good as or better than the competition at the Bakken?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, I think, really, 3 things. I mean, obviously, we've got a great acreage position in both the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks. We have a privileged infrastructure position that we're reaping the benefits now and will in the future. And then thirdly, we have a distinctive operating capability through Lean Manufacturing, and that's people, basically people and culture, and that's what's allowing us to continue to drive down quarter on quarter-on-quarter our well cost and also on productivity. Yes, and we're also scaling that capability over to the Utica, and we're seeing significant reductions in Utica, as well as we leverage those Bakken Lean Manufacturing learnings over to that play also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I would first make a request. I know you're still in early stage, but you, gentlemen, would be able to share the Utica operating data somewhat similar to the format that you gave on Bakken in the supplemental. It may not be in the next 1 or 2 quarter but, say, a couple of quarters down, that would be really helpful.","John P. Rielly","That's something clearly that we're looking at. And especially -- as Greg mentioned, we're focused on getting what our ultimate field development plan will be, and we were planning to add that, but thanks for the comment.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. John, since I got you here, maybe let me ask that. The company today is a much stronger company, both financially and operationally, compared to say anytime in the last 5 years. So from that standpoint that, is there a need of continued hedging? Or what is your overall view on the hedging? Should we change it saying that given your position today, you really don't need to do any hedging?","John P. Rielly","So what we've said, Paul, is that, looking forward, what we'll do -- you're right. We're in a much better position with our balance sheet, but we will look at our price exposure on an annual basis. We are, we think, privileged because we have our portfolio is tilted towards oil. 70-plus percent of our production reserves are oil-based. So we'll look at our price exposure on an annual basis, and we may hedge to provide some insurance, but it will only be for that 1 year at a time.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And this may be bad news [ph for both John Hess and also Greg. Outside the existing already identified asset sales program for the next, say, 1 to 2 years, should we assume that any additional meaningful asset that you guys will be considered or that you're pretty much done, and that is behind?","John B. Hess","Yes, Paul. With the sale of our Retail business, our portfolio restructuring to transform to a pure-play E&P company is substantially complete. Going forward, however, portfolio optimization will be ongoing, to address your question, and be part of the normal course of business, whether it's buying assets or selling assets. Our focus now and in the future is to invest for growth of our production and reserves, deliver strong operating performance from our focus portfolio and most of all, sustain value generation for our shareholders.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","As a final one, yet not related to the quarter. Greg, I was looking at your 10-K on the PV10 table, and I was a little bit surprised that, for Norway, the future development cost is about $8 billion. I thought we already done with all the CapEx spending and it's just incremental well that we need to drill. Why the development expense on that is going to be so high? Does that mean that the CapEx related to Norway will remain high for the coming years?","John P. Rielly","Paul, I'll answer that. From a capital expenditure program, there's a decent amount of capital that we are putting in here that will grow for a number of years. If Valhall is, I think Greg has said in the past, we just redeveloped that field. So it's got a 40-year-plus life, the facilities that are on there. So when you look at those PV10, you've got development cost going out for a number, 40-plus years of development cost there. And so there is a well program. And as you said, it's an asset that generates very good cash flow for us, and we'll continue to invest in in-fill in the field. So that's what those development costs are for.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Should we assume -- I'm sorry. John, should we assume that Norway, the CapEx is going to be flat from over the next several year or that is actually should be lower than this year?","John P. Rielly","I would assume for now because we haven't given any guidance and we'll go as we get towards the end of the year, and we have to work obviously with the operator, BPB [ph] and the operator, but I would assume that there's some flattish-type CapEx in there because there's opportunities for drilling in the field.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First one on Ghana. After you wrap up the 3-well appraisal program presumably by the end of the year, is that going to provide you enough data to make a full development decision either way?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, we believe it will. I mean, I think we'll been in a good position to determine what our go-forward strategy is.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Understood. And then on Kurdistan, I think you mentioned in passing, which you wrote off, a portion of your acreage is followed by one dry hole at Shakrok. Is that right?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, that's right. So the Shakrok well -- although we discovered gas condensate in the Triassic, so there was hydrocarbons in the well, the well was deemed noncommercial.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. So in other words, is that block essentially kind of leading the scene completely?","Gregory P. Hill","In the process of being relinquished, which will take several months, right, but we're drilling the Shireen well now, which is a much larger block, and it appears to be -- and it's offset. So the two are completely unrelated.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","As you think about the Gulf of Mexico volumes with Tubular Bells coming online and maintenance downtime, just trying to familiarize myself with how you incorporate just normal seasonal hurricane downtime into your annual operating plans.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, that's essentially built into our contingency that we build in every year, and so it's just an average number based upon historic performance of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and that's just a bottom line correction to our overall production that's built-in.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","So like 7 days for oil fields and 10 days for -- or 10 days for oil fields something like that.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, round numbers, that's about right.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","And then on the Tioga gas plant with the expansion and then really the de-bottlenecking just -- this is details, but how do you think about the shrink from inlet to outlet? Is there a change to shrink with the expansion of capacity or what is really, I guess, the outlet gas plus the 50,000 barrels of fluids that you're processing?","John P. Rielly","Yes. With the expansion of the plant and obviously, as Greg had mentioned earlier, the boosting of the liquids output, there is a higher shrinkage factor associated with the gas. So you're probably going from a -- previously a 15% type shrinkage to over 50% factor there.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jay R. Wilson","Thank you, Chanel. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.","Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements.","With me today are John Hess, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President, Worldwide Exploration and Production; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","I will now turn the call over to John Hess.","John B. Hess","Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results. ","Net income for the first quarter of 2012 was $545 million. Compared to the year ago quarter, our earnings were negatively impacted by lower crude oil sales volumes and higher operating costs, which more than offset the impact of higher realized crude oil and natural gas selling prices. ","Exploration and Production earned $635 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 397,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was roughly flat with the year ago quarter. Higher production from the Bakken in North Dakota, the Pangkah Field in Indonesia and the Malaysia\/Thailand Joint Development Area offset the impact of North Sea natural gas asset sales and natural field declines in Equatorial Guinea. ","In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken averaged 42,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter compared to 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter. Thus far in April, net production from the Bakken has averaged 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While we expect the monthly average to continue to increase throughout the rest of the year, we now expect the average for the full year may come in somewhat lower than our original estimate of 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As usual, we will update this estimate as well as our overall company production forecast on the July conference call.","At the Llano Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the operator is currently performing a workover on the Llano #3 well, which was shut in for mechanical reasons in the first quarter of last year. We expect that production from this well will resume by the end of May. At Valhall in Norway, field redevelopment is expected to be completed in the third quarter. Net production averaged 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. In Libya, net production averaged 18,000 barrels per day in the first quarter and has averaged 21,000 barrels per day in April. ","With regard to exploration in Ghana, on March 27, we spud the Hickory North well in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block. This prospect is located 3.5 miles west of our Paradise discovery and the well will test reservoirs similar to those found at Paradise, as well as deeper targets. Following completion of Hickory North, we plan to drill a prospect called Sisili, a large structure located approximately 5.5 miles southeast of Paradise. As a result of recently signed farmout agreements, which are subject to final government approvals, Hess' working interest in the block will be reduced from 90% to 35%. ","Offshore Brunei. The Julong East well on Block CA-1, in which Hess has a 13.5% interest, encountered hydrocarbons and the operator is currently evaluating the results. The rig has now moved to the southeast to spud the Jagus East well, which will test an offset to the Gumusut Field, currently under development on the Malaysian side of the border. ","Later in the second quarter, we plan to resume exploration drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Ness Deep, located in Green Canyon 507, is a Miocene prospect in which Hess has a 50% working interest. BHP has the remaining 50% and is the operator. ","Turning to Marketing and Refining. We reported net income of $11 million for the first quarter of 2012. The previously announced shutdown of the HOVENSA joint venture refinery was completed in the first quarter. As a result of the charge taken last quarter, there was no net income impact from HOVENSA's first quarter operations. ","Marketing earnings were $22 million compared to $68 million in last year's first quarter. Retail marketing faced rising wholesale prices during the first quarter, which put pressure on fuel margins. Gasoline volumes on a per site basis were flat, while total convenience store sales were down 2% versus last year's first quarter. Energy Marketing earnings were lower than last year's first quarter as a result of significantly warmer weather this past winter. ","With regard to asset sales, in the first quarter, we closed the sale of our interest in the Snohvit Field in Norway for $132 million and entered into an agreement to sell our interest in the in the Bittern Field in the United Kingdom, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Also in March, we announced that we have started the sale process for our St. Lucia oil terminal. Additional asset sales are in progress, and we will provide updates as soon as details become available. We anticipate that proceeds from asset sales, along with internally generated cash flow, will fund the majority of our capital and exploratory expenditures in 2012. Our principal focus this year continues to be on execution and the sustained profitable growth of our reserves and production. ","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly","Thanks, John. Hello everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Corporation generated consolidated net income of $545 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with a net loss of $131 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, Corporation had earnings of $509 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with $394 million in the previous quarter. ","Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production had income of $635 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with $527 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. First quarter results included a gain of $36 million related to the sale of the corporation's interest in the Snohvit Field, offshore Norway. Excluding the effect of the asset sale, the change in after-tax components of the results were as follows: Lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $16 million. Higher realized selling prices increased earnings by $10 million. Lower exploration expenses improved earnings by $94 million. Higher cash cost decreased income by $29 million. All other items net to an increase in earnings of $13 million, for an overall increase in first quarter adjusted earnings of $72 million. ","Our E&P operations were under-lifted in the quarter compared with production, resulting in decreased after-tax income of approximately $35 million. E&P effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2012 was 40%, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods.","Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining generated income of $11 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with a loss of $561 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Marketing earnings were $22 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, principally reflecting lower margins and volumes in retail operations. ","In refining, Port Reading operations incurred a loss of $6 million in both the first quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011. As discussed last quarter, HOVENSA reported losses of $592 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, which included an after-tax charge of $525 million due to the refinery shutdown. In the first quarter of 2012, trading activities generated a loss of $5 million, compared with a loss of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.","December 31, 2011, Corporation had an accrued liability of $487 million for its share of future funding commitments for costs to shut down HOVENSA's refinery in St. Croix. Corporation, along with its partner, fully funded their estimated commitments in the first quarter of 2012.","Turning to Corporate. Net corporate expenses were $38 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. After-tax interest expense was $63 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared with $57 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher borrowings and bank facility fees. ","Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter, net of funding of the accrued liability to HOVENSA of $487 million, was $988 million. Capital expenditures were $1,878,000,000. Net borrowings were $889 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $132 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $86 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $45 million.","We had $396 million of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2012, and $351 million at December 31, 2011. Total debt was $6,978,000,000 at March 31, 2012, and $6,057,000,000 at December 31, 2011. And the corporation's debt to capitalization ratio was 26.7% at March 31, 2012, compared with 24.6% at the end of 2011. ","This concludes my remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got a couple of questions, if I may. First of all, on the progression in your Bakken production guidance, I wonder if you could help us reconcile what's going on there because basically, if you look at the latest sort of public well data from the state, it looks like your production in -- the vast majority of the wells you drilled, at least in the last 6 months or so, are coming in substantially better than the type curve guidance that you gave us, I guess, last September. So if could you help us understand how that reconciles with the potential risk to the 60,000 barrel a day number and how you expect that progression through the year. And I've got a couple of follow-ups, please.","Gregory P. Hill","I guess before answering your question directly, let me just provide a little context on the Bakken. So the growth from the Bakken continues with our production averaging 42,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, which is up 11% from the fourth quarter and 68% from the first quarter of 2011. In the first quarter, we had 14 operating rigs running. We drilled 37 new wells and completed 52. So that means we currently have 142: 34-plus stage [ph] systems in the ground with 112 on production. Now 86 of these wells have been on production for at least 1 month and have an average 30-day IP rate of around 900 barrels a day. So obviously, very encouraging results. Now although first quarter production was a little lower than planned due to a combination of factors which included changes in well mix resulting from HBP requirements and some permitting bottlenecks, we continue to make progress in drilling efficiency and remain on this very solid growth trajectory. Now over the remainder of the year, Doug, we plan to add 2 to more rigs, going from 14 in first quarter to 16 and 17 for the balance of the year, and then modify our mix to focus our drilling activities on higher productivity and higher working interest areas, also meeting HBP requirements. Now as John said, while we expect the production will continue to increase throughout the year, the average for the full year may come in somewhat lower than our original estimate at 60,000 barrels a day. And as usual, we'll provide an update to that on our July conference call.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Greg, just picking up on some of your comments there. So the working interest in the wells you've been drilling early on in the HBP are more than what are you going to do in the second half of the year? Is that what you just described there?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. We're going to increase the working interest of wells in the latter part of the year than what we've been drilling currently.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","'v","So can you give an indication as to what the difference is and the working interest between the early wells and the later wells?","Gregory P. Hill","No. I can't, Doug. I can't give you average between now and then. But suffice to say, it's going to be drilling higher working at the wells [ph].","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I don't need to push this point too much, but the IP rates, Greg, appear to be substantially better on some of the more recent wells. Can you comment as to what's changed there?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So my comments were around well mix. So as you know, we're in HBP mode, Doug, which means that we're focused on getting acreage held by production rather than focusing on sweet spots. So not surprising, while in this mode, we expect to experience some variability in the IPs. And in the first quarter, we drilled in some areas which had somewhat lower IPs, but they still have very good economics.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. My only other question really is on the CapEx. The first quarter number looks disproportionately high compared to the guidance for the year. Can you talk about -- are we looking at any acquisitions in there? And how does it change your guidance and maybe a little bit of explanation as to why it's so front-end loaded? And I'll leave it at that.","John P. Rielly","Sure, Doug. As you know, it's still early in the year. And as usual, we'll provide an update to the capital spend guidance on the Q2 earnings call. Having said that, we are seeing upward pressure in scope in certain areas, as Greg just mentioned, such as the Bakken, where we'll be adding some rigs as we go throughout the year and we're shifting to drilling the higher working interest areas, as well in Tubular Bells, actually. Just sent a fourth rig that arrived earlier in the Gulf of Mexico. So it's actually in like 4 to 5 months to full year than we originally planned. So it's just an acceleration of spend into the year. Now however, even with that upward pressure in capital, as John mentioned earlier, we still anticipate funding the majority of our 2012 capital program with cash flow from operations and asset sales.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So the guidance is -- the $6.8 billion guidance, John, what does that look like?","John P. Rielly","We're going to -- we will update that on the second quarter conference call. But there is upward pressure on that number, as I spoke about.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just coming back to this Bakken issue, I mean how much of -- so as you sort of move through HBP, are there any acceleration in terms of the timing of getting through to the end of that HBP to give some confidence that in 2013, the performance is going to improve relative to the weaker performance in the first quarter?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So Ed, again, we're increasing our rig count. So we're going up 2 rigs. We currently have 14 on a couple of new builds from Precision where we got rid of the old style rig. So we'll increase the well count. And we are moving back into some higher productivity and higher working interest areas in our HBP acreage.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But to be, I guess, specific, if I look at some of the data, your wells seem to be down for longer periods than some of the competitors. So the actual calendar day, sort of IP, is lower than the sort of type curves. How are you going to close that gap relative to some of the other operators that we see up in North Dakota?","Gregory P. Hill","Not really familiar with what you're talking about. I will tell you that our data shows we're very competitive with other operators in North Dakota.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The issue is that each well doesn't produce as many days in any particular year, according to the Dakota information, in any month, particularly in the first couple of months, which could be infrastructure, could be HBP.","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. I mean, it's early days, Ed. I mean, remember, we're adding a lot of infrastructure in North Dakota, much more than some of our competitors.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just a follow-on question on CapEx. How much is the infrastructure spend as opposed to drilling spend in the Bakken this year?","John P. Rielly","We've been running about $400 million to $500 million on infrastructure-type cost in the Bakken. And obviously, as Greg said, we're building that out and then that we'll go down in future years.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And when do you think you'd see that inflection coming?","John P. Rielly","We should start seeing some reductions in 2013 on those infrastructure costs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio, Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","With Bakken and CapEx, a little more coverage here. Congrats on the execution of the Ghana sell down, was that a -- can you provide any color on the terms of the cap or on the promote? And is that likely to come into effect? And then with Hickory North spud in late March, we expect 60 to 90 days on that well. And is there any joint maybe pre-drill P50 that you could share with us?","Gregory P. Hill","Let me kind of take your questions in reverse order, Evan. No, we don't provide any pre-drill estimates on exploration wells basically. The rig -- again, it will be about a 90-day well, 60 to 90 days, depending on testing and whatnot. Regarding the deals, the terms are confidential -- of both deals. So there's 2 partners. They're farming into the block. Final government approval was still required but both involved a combination of promote to pay a disproportionate amount of the well cost or an interest in the block.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if -- shifting gears to the Brunei exploration. Julong East -- interpret the release in any color on whether that was commercial, or any color on what type of prospect that or I guess Jagus East is. I mean, were these the offset structures to Kikeh or Gumusut or were they lookalikes like the first prospect?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Evan. So the first -- the last well we drilled was a discovery. Total is in the process of evaluating the results of the well, which we believe is an offset to the Kikeh Field. So I think it's best -- we're in the middle of evaluation and I think it's best for us to refer you to the operator for additional details. But it was a discovery. Regarding the current well that we're on, it is an offset to the -- offset location to the Gumusut Field, which Shell is developing in Malaysia, as John mentioned in his opening remark.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, good. If I could squeeze one last one in here, maybe back to the Bakken. I know realization is more discounted year-on-year in the first quarter. You should see some offset in the second quarter and beyond. Can you update us on the -- on your unreal [ph] volumes in the quarter and where you may be now on takeaway capacity?","John B. Hess","Yes. We just started up our rail facility and we're going to be moving about approximately 25,000 barrels a day of Bakken crude down to St. James, Louisiana. Spread is now, between LLS versus WTI plus the discount off of WTI to get it into Clearbrook or North Dakota or Western North Dakota as the case may be, is in about the $25 range. In March, it was closer to the $40 range. In prior months, it was closer to $20. So obviously, that's margin upgrade that we get on about 25,000 barrels a day. But we just started the rail facility in full force, and we should be ramping up during the year to higher volumes. Our full capacity for all the rail cars that we're going to have by the end of the year could be in the range of 50,000 to 54,000 barrels a day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Murti, Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of more Bakken questions. The fact that you're doing a bunch of HBP drilling, is that in effect creating some bit of a backlog in terms of tying things in, maybe allowing for a catch-up at some point in the future and next year? And then secondly, can you talk about where well costs are trending in -- on your Bakken wells?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, sure. Let me just answer both of the questions. First of all, let me just again reinforce there were 2 issues in the first quarter. So the first thing was permitting issue, which really just reflects the huge amount of activity in North Dakota. So during the first quarter, we experienced some delays in receiving permits at certain locations, which resulted in delays in getting wells on production. So we're working with the state to resolve these issues. And then my second comment was around well mix, where you're in HBP mode and focused on acreage being held by production rather than focusing on the sweet spots. And of course, while in this mode, you're going to experience some variability in IPs. I think the final thing, Arjun, is when you're in HBP mode, you're essentially drilling the first well and pad, right. So you have a lot more movement of manpower, rigs, materials then when you're in pad drilling mode, which is different than some of our competitors that are back in pad drilling mode. So those are improvements we expect once we return to pad drilling in late 2012, early 2013.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That makes sense, Greg. Is there a backlog, so to speak, of stuff that needs to be tied in beyond some of the permitting delays you talked about?","Gregory P. Hill","There is. So we still have a backlog of wells to complete. That backlog is coming down, and we expect to be in the normal backlog. Normal will be 20 to 25 wells. Though in the backlog, this is part of your process, that work in progress. You had one more question.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well cost.","Gregory P. Hill","You had one more question on well cost. A good number to use for 2012 is $10 million for drilling and completing wells. Our Q1 costs were a little higher due to a shortage of white sand proppant. However, that issue is now resolved. We expect our cost to drop as we transition to a full sliding sleeve completion. We're going to full 34-stage sliding sleeve completion. And we continue to achieve drilling efficiency gains. This quarter, our drilling days were down [indiscernible] 7. Before, they were 30 days. So we're continuing to see those drilling efficiency gains as well, which would get even better and better as we go to sliding sleeve and HBP drilling.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. On the Utica, any update on what you're doing there?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, the Utica, I think -- I mean, we're still in very early stages of our appraisal of the Utica, with only 2 wells having been drilled and completed both on our acreage and the CONSOL acreage. So as we mentioned in our last call, we completed the Marquette well in Jefferson County end of the year. That well flowed at an initial rate of 11 million cubic feet a day. It's currently producing 4.5 million cubic feet a day. And the reason is that's curtailed by pipeline capacity. So it's got much more potential than that. Our partner, CONSOL Energy, recently completed a well in Tuscarawas County, which is 45 miles west-northwest of our Marquette wells. It's currently under evaluation. We will commence our Hess-operated drilling program in mid-May.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then just a final quick follow-up. Was there any material acreage acquisition cost in that 1Q CapEx? Or it's just a comment about scope and so forth that John -- I think John Rielly had mentioned?","John P. Rielly","There were some, just the routine type acreage, filling acreage cost, but nothing overly significant.","Operator","Next question comes from Robert Kessler, Tudor Pickering, Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on the Bakken. For your, say, 42,000 barrels a day of net production, how much of that might be nonoperated?","Gregory P. Hill","We don't have that number here right now, Robert. We can get back to you with that number.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then separately on Tubular Bells, can you help me understand a little bit of the rationale for the strategy to sort of outsource the production facility to Williams and its Gulfstar FPS, and a little bit of color around the structure of that arrangement?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes, Robert. That was -- just to remind everyone on the call, that arrangement was actually done by BP. If we recall on October 2011, we increased our interest to 57% from 40%, basically took over between us and Chevron BP's interest. And that was the development concept that was underway at that time. And we just continued on with the development concept.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Is there any way to provide some kind of overall kind of cash cost for Tubular Bells inclusive of the fee you have to pay for processing?","Gregory P. Hill","No, Robert. We don't go down to that level of detail at this point in time. And again, we have to wait to see if the development actually starts up as well.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Is it fair to say you're on the hook for a certain amount of payment even if the wells are not brought online on time?","Gregory P. Hill","No. It goes post development. So as production comes on, the facility effectively then gets paid off. That's part of the processing fee.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then I think Williams also references their comfort that they'll be carried through, say, hurricane disruption risk, which is currently not inconsequential in the Gulf of Mexico for up to, say, 6 months or so. How does that work? Do you still make payments to the operator of the facility even if you're not producing in that scenario?","Gregory P. Hill","Those type of terms actually we won't discuss on a call. That's kind of -- that's confidential at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng, Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Greg, can you share with us what is in Bakken, your current cash lifting cost?","Gregory P. Hill","Paul, we don't break -- again, break that down. You can see, obviously, in the U.S. that the Bakken is a good part of the production in the U.S. So it's built into those costs.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, is the unit cash cost higher or about the same as your average U.S.?","John P. Rielly","With the Bakken again, what we have right now is a ramp-up. So there's a lot of people. There's a lot of equipment and everything being done to support the growth that's going on there. So just like with the cash cost, as well as on DD&A, where the initial DD&A rates are high because the reserve bookings lag the investment dollars, you will have that kind of higher cost type impact that will come down over time.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","We understand. I just want to note that we need to look at that based on and see that what kind of improvement we could potentially expect. If you can draw down to some of the -- your competitor in the basin, then maybe down to 5 or 6, are we at this point in the 20-plus or at the 15? Are we -- I mean, what kind of improvement at least we could expect from a cash flow standpoint going forward? You have assumed indeed would be once you move to the batch and be able to move down to the kind of cost curve as your best competitor. So we're just trying to get some better understanding.","John B. Hess","Yes, Paul. I think we are one of the best competitors. We are pre-investing in infrastructure, over $500 million on our Tiago Gas Plant to strip liquids out and be able to capture the value from the natural gas. Most people don't have that or they have to pay a lot on tariffs to get access to that. The rail facility is already showing its wisdom of revenue upgrade. It's not just about cost, as you well know. And on the cost side, our people are very efficient. Obviously, the logistical challenge of the 14- and ultimately 16-rig program going -- manufacturing, HBP, it's going through the early phases of ramp-up in a very big operation. And that creates some of the noise and the unit costs. But we do see those stabilizing over time. And then last but not least, as we get more well production history, we will be booking more proved reserves, which will also help us in terms of the DD&A. So it's early stages of a major investment for our company, creates some volatility and being able to predict both on the cost side and on the production side. But we're very confident that we're on a solid growth trajectory. And as we move forward in time, our unit costs will improve.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, I understand that, John, but I just want to see if you can give us some number or some estimate so that we can -- you say that's a baseline, so that we can do some calculation ourselves what is the improvement that we could expect from a cash flow and earning from that operation over the next several years?","John B. Hess","I think you will able to see that, Paul, as we deliver results. So as we deliver results, I think you'll be more satisfied with the answer.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the unit train [ph], assume if the economic years permit, how quickly or that -- what is the fastest that you can get ramp up to 50,000-54,000 barrel per day? And what is the limitation in terms of the time take to ramp it up?","John B. Hess","It's a number of things. It's ability to offtake in the market. It's access to 2 of the trains we leased out, I think, of the 9 train sets that we have until about August. So gradually, you'll see a ramp-up from the 25,000 barrels a day now ultimately to that 50,000-barrel-a-day number or higher by the end of the year.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So by the end of the year. So you're not going to be able to get that, say, by the third quarter?","John B. Hess","As I said, there will be a gradual ramp-up from 25,000 barrels a day right now to about 50,000 to 54,000 by the end of the year.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us an update on the Valhall?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Paul, this is Greg. Valhall production about flat. I mean, the -- as we've said before, the BRD will be done this year. And so you can expect volume at Valhall to be about flat with what it was last year until we get that redevelopment program done. We do have -- we are doing some producer drilling this year. So we're anxious to see the results of that producer drilling as those wells come online.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Greg, are we still talking about in the third quarter the redevelopment start-up?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. The work on the redevelopment occurs in the third quarter.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. On Utica, CONSOL, that well, I think, has been complete more than 1 month ago. Do you have any production number you can share?","Gregory P. Hill","The operator. You have to refer to the operator on that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. A final one on Libya. What was the sales being record in the first quarter?","John P. Rielly","In Libya, we did get a lift towards the end of March. So we had a lift in approximately a 600,000-barrel type area. So we did have a significant under-lift with Libya. We had an under-lift of approximately 950,000 barrels for Libya in the first quarter.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So John, should we assume that as you start to catching up your effective tax rate for international E&P, it would be substantially higher because of Libya?","John P. Rielly","Correct. If you assume that lifting catch-up in equal production, that will increase that effective tax rate and will get it up, if lifting vehicle production, into the -- overall, this is 44% to 48% effective rate range.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How much? I'm sorry.","John P. Rielly","44% to 48%, if Libya -- if we get all our production lifting and catch-up. The other thing that Libya does then it will help us on the unit cost. So from the unit cost aspect, our unit cost will go down $1 to $2 per BOE.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is the 44% to 48%, is that total E&P or just international E&P?","John P. Rielly","Total E&P.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Total E&P. Do you have an estimate of your deferred tax look like in this year?","John P. Rielly","No. Now that's too early to be able to do that, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Sankey, Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On your -- if I could ask about your cash flows. Forgive me if you mentioned this, but was there any major working capital movements within that number that you gave?","John P. Rielly","The big movement was the funding of our HOVENSA commitment. So we had an accrued liability of $487 million related to the shutdown for HOVENSA. So we, along with our partner, funded our share. So we funded the $487 million to HOVENSA in the first quarter because there was a tender offer for the debt down there at HOVENSA and due to the timing of the liquidation proceeds from the inventory and also the timing of shutdown cost. So we fully funded. That was the biggest impact from the working capital standpoint. There were other positive impacts of working capital aside from that of approximately $240 million.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So the entire $487 million you just mentioned was within the quarter?","John P. Rielly","Was within the quarter.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then it was offset by $240 million positive.","John P. Rielly","Correct. And the -- we do not expect any more funding for HOVENSA for the rest of the year.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I've got you. Can you give us a sense of the cash impact of the hedges in the quarter?","John P. Rielly","Sure. So I mean, you saw the after-tax impact was $71 million in the quarter. So you can just divide that by the effective tax rate. So it's approximately $110 million to $115 million pretax.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That is helpful. I was wondering, you gave a number for -- I believe you gave a number for infrastructure spend in the Bakken of about $400 million, just in the Q&A. Do you have a number for the spend, the overall CapEx in the Bakken for the year?","John P. Rielly","No. We don't have that number at this time.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's simply that you obviously -- that you just don't break it out, right?","John P. Rielly","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Pavel Molchanov, Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, no one has asked about downstream yet, so I thought I would do that. I just saw the -- a news release from the EPA stating that you guys will be investing $45 million in pollution controls at Port Reading. Given that refinery just seems to be kind of in perpetually in the red, I'm curious what the logic is to retain it and in fact invest more in the facility rather than just do what you did with HOVENSA?","John B. Hess","No. As you -- no, Port Reading is a much smaller refining complex than HOVENSA. As long as its -- generates acceptable financial returns, we'll keep running it. And as there are updates to be given on its status, we will give them.","Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. What do you think needs to happen to get margins at that facility to an acceptable levels? I mean, is it a purely kind of crack spread issues? Or are there internal changes that could be made?","John B. Hess","The biggest determinant is market conditions, which obviously we have no control over.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Faisel Khan, Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you could, maybe I missed this, give us an update on the Eagle Ford. What kind of well results that you had out of that basin?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. Faisel, this is Greg. So we have -- just recall, we currently have about 109,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford. And we drilled 38 wells, 29 completed and brought on production. Now of those 29, 22 wells have been on more than 30 days and they delivered 30-day IP rates ranging between 250 and 650 barrels a day. So keep in mind the Eagle Ford is just like all of our unconventional plays. We're still very early in the appraisal mode on the Eagle Ford.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And what's the mix of black oil versus condensate versus NGLs and gas or maybe just a liquids-gas ratio?","Gregory P. Hill","Yes. So we're -- with the current well mix, it's about 60-40. But part of our appraisal program is to move through different areas of the oil window, condensate window, et cetera. So that number is going to change over time as we appraise it.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just going back to the funding of HOVENSA. Was all that capital related to the debt, or was it also related to some sort of environmental remediation sort of liability?","John P. Rielly","No. So HOVENSA, they had debt to be extinguished plus they had the overall shutdown cost. So at the end of the year, we had an accrual for $487 million for the totality of shutting down HOVENSA. So that was going to be the total amount that Hess -- and our estimate was that we were going to fund. We put that in there. And it's for the debt and other related shutdown cost.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And what happens to the inventory? How does that kind of come back you guys?","John P. Rielly","So that inventory was -- the liquidation of the inventory was net in that estimate. Our estimate then was reduced by the estimated proceeds from the inventory.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So what happens from now on? Is it -- I guess you could turn the facility into a terminal, and then is there any value that you could accrue back from that sort of situation?","John P. Rielly","That is the plan right now, that HOVENSA will be turned into a storage terminal.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, so you then collect a fee-based sort of revenue off of it over time?","John P. Rielly","Correct.","Operator","And you have a follow-up from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Greg, where are we in the Australian gas appraisal and the supply agreement negotiation?","Gregory P. Hill","Just -- the Jack Bates rig has returned on location there, and we expect to complete all of our appraisal work by mid-2012. So that's complete drilling of 1 well plus 2 tests. So test the well that we're drilling. Let's then go back to a well that was previously drilled that we plan to test. Now in parallel, we continue these commercial discussions with the liquefaction partners. Our aim is to complete those in 2012, and those are ongoing, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Greg, in Bakken, what's the split in your liquids between black oil and condensate? Is the bulk of your production in the liquids side is black oil or just condensate?","Gregory P. Hill","Majority is black oil. Approximately, like -- you're getting like 85% to 90% black oil.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So it's black oil. And then in Eagle Ford, just when you say 60-40, is that 60% condensate, 40% black oil? Or are you talking about just between the liquid and gas mix?","Gregory P. Hill","No. It's 60% condensate, 40% black oil. It's kind of that split. But again, Paul, remember, we're in appraisal mode. So those numbers are constantly moving around as we move around in the play.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A session. That also concludes the presentation.

Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will provide an update on our progress in executing our strategy including a number of major milestones achieved in the quarter. Greg Hill will then review our operating performance and John Rielly will review our financial results.","We believe our company has the best long-term growth outlook in our history, as well as one of the best in the industry. It is value driven with an increasing resource base, production growth, lower cost per barrel and improving financial returns. Our growth is underpinned by four key areas; the Bakken; North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand; Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and offshore Guyana.","With regard to the Bakken, we have an industry-leading strategic position with more drilling locations in the core of the play than any other operator. We are currently operating four rigs at 60-stage fracs and increased proppant levels should deliver production growth of approximately 10% a year over the next several years. With our productivity and technology improvements, we now forecast virtually the same production growth with four rigs that would've taken six rigs a year ago. We will decide whether to add two additional rigs as originally planned based on an improvement in crude oil prices and the results of our enhanced completions.","Second quarter net production in the Bakken averaged 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, we forecast Bakken production to average approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the high end of our previous guidance of 95,000 barrels to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to strong performance by our Bakken team and results of our new completions.","In the Gulf of Thailand, the North Malay Basin Full Field Development achieved first production of natural gas earlier this month. Hess is the operator with 50% interest and Petronas is our partner with the remaining 50%. We are still in the process of commissioning the field and expect net production to reach its planned plateau rate of 165 million cubic feet a day of natural gas during the third quarter. North Malay Basin is expected to generate strong and stable production and cash flows for many years to come.","In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Hess operated Stampede Development in which Hess has a 25% interest is on track to start up in the first half of 2018. Net production is expected to increase throughout 2018 and reach a peak rate of approximately 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. In June, we announced positive results from the Liza-4 well, which encountered more than 197 feet of net pay. Yesterday, the operator announced successful results from the Payara-2 appraisal well with 59 feet of net pay, which confirms a second giant oil field discovered in Guyana and increases Payara gross discovered recoverable resources to approximately 500 million barrels of oil equivalent. Gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block, which include discoveries at Liza, Liza Deep, Snoek and Payara have now been increased to an estimated 2.25 billion to 2.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In addition, to the considerable resources discovered to-date, we see additional multi-billion barrels of unrisked exploration potential on the Stabroek Block.","In June, we also sanctioned the first phase of a planned multi-phased development of the Liza Field, which is expected to have a gross capital cost of approximately $3.2 billion for drilling and subsea infrastructure and will develop approximately 450 million barrels of oil, with first production expected by 2020. The development will utilize a leased floating production storage and offloading vessel that will have the capacity to process up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day.","The Liza Phase I development offers very attractive financial returns and a rapid cash payback with a manageable pace of investment. Hess' net share of development costs is forecast to be approximately $955 million, of which $110 million is already included in our 2017 capital and exploratory budget. Of the remaining net development costs, approximately $250 million is expected in 2018 and approximately $330 million in 2019, with the balance in 2020 and 2021.","Our success in Guyana is transformational and positions our company for a decade plus of resource and production growth with improving returns and cost metrics. Funding these growth opportunities requires a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, which remain a top priority for our company. At June 30, we had $2.5 billion of cash and total liquidity of $6.8 billion and we continue to take steps to keep our financial position strong.","In April, we successfully completed the initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP resulting in net proceeds of $175 million to Hess Corporation. The MLP structure will allow us to further unlock value with a combination of embedded growth in EBITDA as Bakken production continues to increase and through future drop downs. Hess Midstream Partners LP will announce its second quarter results tomorrow.","Our success in Guyana also provides us with the opportunity to consider the divestment of mature higher cost assets, which can accelerate their value while upgrading our overall portfolio and also providing additional funding for our high return growth opportunities. Last month we announced an agreement to sell our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin for a total consideration of $600 million. This transaction is on track to close on August 1.","In addition, we expect net cash flow to improve over the next several years as our $700 million of annual spend for North Malay Basin and Stampede winds down and these two projects go from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company.","In the current low price environment, we continue our efforts to reduce both capital and operating costs. For the second quarter, E&P capital and exploratory expenditures were $528 million and we now project our full year 2017 capital and exploratory expenditures to be $2.15 billion, or $100 million below our previous forecast. It should also be noted that our major growth projects, the Bakken, North Malay Basin, Stampede, and Liza are all expected to have cash unit operating costs that are substantially below our current portfolio average.","Now turning to our financial results, in the second quarter of 2017 we posted a pre-tax loss of $425 million, which reflects improved operating results compared to the pre-tax loss of $678 million in the second quarter of last year. On an after-tax basis, our net loss was $449 million, or $1.46 per common share compared with the net loss of $392 million, or $1.29 per common share in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting a lower effective tax rate in 2017 resulting from a required change in deferred tax accounting.","Second quarter production was above our guidance range averaging 294,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, driven by strong performance across our portfolio. Net production in Libya was 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter.","For the full year 2017, we now expect net production of 305,000 to 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, which is at the upper end of our previous guidance, even with the sale of our Permian EOR assets that have net production of approximately 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Production growth resumes beginning in the third quarter. And fourth quarter production is expected to average 7% to 10% higher than last year's fourth quarter pro forma for the sale of our Permian EOR assets. In addition, we expect next year to show strong growth driven by higher activity levels in the Bakken, a full year of production from the North Malay Basin, the startup of the Stampede field, and a full year of drilling at Valhall.","In summary, we are well positioned to deliver value-driven growth to our shareholders with our strong short cycle position in the Bakken, our two offshore developments in North Malay Basin and Stampede expected to deliver a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and our world-class development in Guyana, which also offers significant further exploration potential. We continue to prioritize a strong cash position and balance sheet to fund this growth, which we believe will create compelling value for our shareholders for many years to come.","I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update of our operational performance in 2017 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production, in the second quarter, we averaged 295,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This was 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above the midpoint of our guidance range of 275,000 to 285,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong performance across our portfolio, particularly in the Bakken.","The third quarter will be a major inflection point for us in terms of production growth. We forecast net production to average between 295,000 and 305,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. The startup of production from the North Malay Basin Full-Field Development is expected to more than offset the impact of the sale of our Permian EOR assets, as well as a now completed unplanned 10-day shutdown in July at the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand to replace a flare tip.","Our positive production momentum will continue in the fourth quarter, with a full quarter of production from North Malay Basin, a continuing ramp up in the Bakken, and as we bring online new wells at the Valhall Field in Norway and our Penn State field in the Gulf of Mexico. As John noted, given our strong operating performance year-to-date and even with the sale of our Permian EOR asset, which is currently producing about 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, we now forecast full year 2017 production to average between 305,000 and 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is the upper end of our previous guidance range.","Turning now to onshore operations, net production from the Bakken averaged 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, significantly beating our guidance of approximately 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, as the productivity of our new wells continues to perform higher than forecast. As noted in our last call, we added a third operated rig in the Bakken in March and a fourth in April. As a result of our strategy to preserve capability during the downturn, we were able to onboard these two rigs safely and with a high degree of efficiency.","During the second quarter, we drilled 23 wells and brought 13 new wells online compared to the year-ago quarter when we drilled 20 wells and brought 26 wells online. We also completed 14 wells in the quarter. We continue to test higher stage counts and proppant loading in line with our focus on maximizing the value of our DSUs. We currently have six 60-stage wells online and 11 wells completed with proppant loading of up to 140,000 pounds per stage. While still early days, we continue to be encouraged by the initial results from our new completions.","Drilling and completion costs for our 60-stage 70,000 pound per stage wells are averaging between $4.5 million and $5 million, which is approximately $0.5 million below our initial guidance range. This result reflects our distinctive Lean manufacturing approach, which continues to drive improvement in our operations. Drilling and completion costs for the higher-proppant wells are in line with our previous guidance of $5.5 million to $6 million.","To mitigate the risk of rising sand prices, in the second quarter, we pre-purchased our sand requirements for the balance of 2017, which is expected to save us between 15% and 20% versus current spot prices.","Based on encouraging production performance from our trials and the positive outputs that our predictive models are showing, we have decided to move to 60-stage completions as our new standard, while continuing to evaluate the impact of higher proppant loadings up to 140,000 pounds per stage. Early results and predictive model outputs suggest a potential 10% to 15% uplift in EUR as a result of the higher stage counts and proppant loading. In addition, we are able to raise full year 2017 average IP 90 guidance to between 800 and 850 barrels of oil per day, an increase of 100 barrels of oil per day compared to our earlier guidance.","The material increases in performance that have been achieved this year now allow us to hold Bakken production flat with 2.5 rigs versus 3.25 rigs required a year ago. Given the strong performance of our Bakken wells in the first half of the year, we forecast net Bakken production for the third quarter to average between 105,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the fourth quarter to average between 110,000 and 115,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This results in an increase to our full year guidance for the Bakken of 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent.","Now moving to the offshore, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 51,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the second quarter, as planned shutdowns were successfully completed at non-operated host facilities for the Conger and Llano fields. No significant shutdowns are planned for the third quarter and production is forecast to average between 60,000 and 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the Gulf of Mexico.","We also successfully drilled a new production well in the Penn State field. The well is currently being completed and is expected to be online in the fourth quarter.","In Norway, at the Aker BP operated Valhall Field in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter. We drilled and are currently completing the first well of a seven well campaign and have spud the second well. The first well was drilled 38 days ahead of schedule and is now expected to come online late in the third quarter. A 10-day shutdown is planned for the third quarter, over which net production is expected to average approximately 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day before increasing to approximately 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter.","Moving to offshore developments. First gas was introduced to the platform on July 10 from the Full-Field Development of the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator with Petronas as our partner. The North Malay Basin project delivery was achieved with first gas only three years after project sanction. We are still in the process of commissioning but expect net production to build to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day net during the third quarter and the asset to become a significant long-term cash generator for the company.","At the Stampede Development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, the Tension Leg Platform was installed and hook up and commissioning are progressing to schedule. One well has been drilled and completed and completion operations are underway on the second and third wells. First oil is planned for first half of 2018.","Now moving to the offshore Guyana. In June, we sanctioned the first phase of the multi-phased development of the Liza Field, in which Stabroek Block operated by ExxonMobil and in which Hess holds a 30% interest. This is an asset of exceptional scale with a high quality multi-DRC (20:57) permeability reservoir and attractive financial returns at oil prices down to $35 Brent. Phase I will utilize a leased floating production storage and offloading vessel that will have the capacity to process up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day. First oil is expected by 2020, only three years after sanction.","With regard to the continuing exploration and appraisal of the Stabroek Block, as John noted, in mid-June we announced positive results for the Liza-4 well where we encountered 197 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs.","Yesterday, ExxonMobil announced the successful result of the Payara-2 well, which encountered 59 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. This positive result increases the gross discovered recoverable resource at Payara to approximately 500 million barrels of oil equivalent confirming the partnership's second giant oil field discovery in Guyana. The well results increase the currently discovered gross recoverable resource on the Stabroek Block to between 2.25 billion and 2.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We plan to continue to progress exploration of the wider Stabroek Block during the remainder of 2017 and 2018 where we see numerous remaining prospects across multiple play types representing multi-billion barrel unrisked upside potential on this 6.6 million acre block. Current thinking is that after completing the evaluation of Payara-2, the rig will move to the Turbid (22:44) prospect and then to the Ranger prospect.","Earlier this month, we also announced early entry to Block 59 and Suriname together with our co-venture partners, ExxonMobil and Statoil, and in which Hess holds a one-third interest. This 2.8 million acre block shares a maritime border with Guyana and extensions of the play fairways that we see in Stabroek. Block 59 is also contiguous to the 1.3 million acre Block 42 and Suriname in which Hess holds a one-third interest with our co-venture partner Chevron and Kosmos.","In closing, we have once again demonstrated excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. Our production momentum continues with ever stronger results from the Bakken, the commissioning of the North Malay Basin Full-Field Development, and planned first oil from Stampede in the first half of 2018. Together with our partners in Guyana, we have sanctioned the first phase of development of the world-class Liza Field and the potential of the Stabroek Block continues to get bigger and better.","I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today I will compare results from the second quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2017. In the second quarter of 2017, we reported a net loss of $449 million compared with a net loss of $324 million in the previous quarter.","Turning to Exploration and Production, E&P incurred a net loss of $354 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to a net loss of $233 million in the first quarter of 2017. The changes in the after-tax components of E&P results between the second quarter and first quarter of 2017 were as follows; lower realized selling prices reduced results by $51 million. Changes in sales mix driven by Gulf of Mexico maintenance reduced results by $26 million. Higher DD&A expense reduced results by $16 million. Unrealized losses due to crude oil hedge ineffectiveness reduced results by $16 million. All other items reduced results by $12 million for an overall decrease in second quarter results of $121 million.","The E&P effective income tax rate was a benefit of 8% for the second quarter of 2017 compared with the benefit of 13% in the first quarter excluding Libyan operations. For the second quarter, our E&P sales volumes were under lifted compared with production by approximately 290,000 barrels, which did not have a material impact on our results.","Turning to Midstream, in the second quarter of 2017, the Midstream segment had net income of $16 million which was down from net income of $18 million in the first quarter of 2017 due to a non-recurring charge of $3 million related to our Permian midstream business. EBITDA for the Midstream, before the non-controlling interest, amounted to $96 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $94 million in the first quarter of 2017.","Turning to Corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $111 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $109 million in the first quarter of 2017.","Turning to second quarter cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities, before changes in working capital, was $332 million. The net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital amounted to $167 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $480 million. Net proceeds received by Hess Corporation from Hess Midstream Partners IPO were $175 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $79 million. Net repayments of debt were $52 million. Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $90 million. All other items were a net increase in cash of $9 million resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $194 million.","Changes in working capital during the second quarter included non-recurring payments totaling approximately $130 million related to line fill for the Dakota Access Pipeline, termination payments for an offshore drilling rig, premiums on crude oil hedge contracts and prepayments for frac sand in North Dakota.","Turning to our financial position. Excluding Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.45 billion, total liquidity of $6.8 billion including available committed credit facilities and debt of $6.035 billion at June 30, 2017. In August, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $600 million from the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian basin.","Now to turn to guidance, first for E&P. Our updated 2017 guidance includes the anticipated impact of the Permian sale which assumes a completion date of August 1. We project cash costs for E&P operations in the third quarter to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel and $13 to $14 per barrel in the fourth quarter reflecting the impact of higher fourth quarter production from North Malay Basin and Bakken. The lower cash costs projected for the fourth quarter of 2017 will continue in 2018 with Stampede commencing production and Bakken volumes increasing. Full year 2017 cash cost guidance is now $14 to $15 per barrel, which is down from previous guidance of $15 to $16 per barrel due to ongoing cost reduction efforts and strong production performance.","DD&A per barrel is forecast to be in the range of $25 to $26 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, and $24.50 to $25.50 per barrel for the full year of 2017, which is up from previous guidance of $24 to $25 per barrel. The increase in the full year guidance is due to better performance by Tubular Bells and the Bakken, both of which have higher DD&A rates than the portfolio average. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $39.50 to $41.50 per barrel in the third quarter and $38.50 to $40.50 per barrel for the full year.","Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million in the third quarter with full year guidance remaining unchanged at $250 million to $270 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million for the third quarter and $520 million to $535 million for the full year, which is updated from previous guidance of $520 million to $550 million.","The E&P effective tax rate excluding Libya is expected to be a benefit in the range of 10% to 14% for the third quarter. For the full year we now expect a benefit in the range of 11% to 15%, which is down from previous guidance of 12% to 16% due to a change in mix of operating results.","Now for Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter and $65 million to $75 million for the full year, which is updated from previous guidance of $65 million to $85 million due to the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian basin.","Turning to Corporate, we expect corporate expenses to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of $135 million to $145 million, down from previous guidance of $140 million to $150 million. We anticipate interest expenses to be in the range of $70 million to $75 million for the third quarter and $295 million to $305 million for the full year, which is unchanged from previous guidance.","This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Start out in the Bakken, as you think about the decision to take that rig count or not to take that rig count up to 6 to 4, can you talk to some of the points of guidance you expect to make that decision, oil price et cetera? And it seemed like in the Bakken one of the reasons maybe beyond the productivity for the very strong production came from a higher mix of gas and NGLs, and can you talk more to how much more upside there could be on the gas and NGLs from flaring less?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Let me take your first question Brian. So what's going to drive the decision to increase the rig count, as John mentioned in his opening remarks, we're currently operating 4 rigs that, with the 60-stage fracs and the increased proppant levels, 4 rigs should deliver a production growth of approximately 10% a year over the next several years which is nearly the same production growth with 4 rigs that would've taken with 6 rigs a year ago. So because of those factors, the decision is really going to be based upon the crude oil outlook at the end of the year and also, will we continue to see higher and higher performance from those enhanced completions. So those are going to be the two things that we're going to be looking at.","In regards to your NGL and gas, as you know, we just brought on the Hawkeye Facility in the first quarter and so we continue to gather more and more third-party volumes as we go through as well as our own volumes south of the river, so.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah, the oil and gas mix at the wellhead is the same. This is just a question of us capturing more gas due to south of the river having the infrastructure there, reducing our flaring footprint. So it has nothing to do with well performance.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And then the follow-up, and I may have misheard but I think when you talked about the DD&A per barrel forecast going up attributed to stronger well performance than Tubular Bells and the Bakken. If the well performance is stronger, can you just talk to why that's increasing the DD&A rate versus lowering F&D costs\/DD&A?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. So from a forecast standpoint on Tubular Bells, Tubular Bells actually produced 19,000 barrels a day on average in the second quarter. And so when you calculate the DD&A, it's still based on the same reserves that we had at the beginning of the year. Now with production we may get an update in reserves as we move through the year, but as of right now with the quarter, you're using the same calculation. So all we're getting is more barrels with the same DD&A rate that we had previously. So the DD&A rate for Tubular Bells is above our portfolio average rate. So the more barrels it produces, it just increases our overall DD&A. And right now with the Bakken same thing, and we'll continue to see with the uplift in EURs, adding more and more reserves, but right now the Bakken DD&A rate is above our portfolio average. So as we bring on more volumes there, it does increase DD&A. All non-cash, all happy to get because both Tubular Bells and Bakken are delivering more cash flow as a result of it. But just from a pure accounting requirement on the DD&A, it just gives us a higher DD&A.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And so it sounds like it's more timing than not. Obviously, the IRR goes up if you're getting the production out more quickly, but do you think that the EURs in both areas are actually on the rise? Or in places like Tubular Bells, it is just that the production is getting out more quickly?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So they both are getting higher. So I mean you've heard what's been happening with our type curves in the Bakken, so we are producing. Our EURs are performing above our type curve forecast, which will obviously then lead to higher reserves. And Tubular Bells, as well, we're doing kind of the slow ramp and bringing it up to production. Tubular Bells is currently producing around 20,000 barrels a day. So we are getting, like you said, better returns and over time that will get into our reserve numbers.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Just wanted to first talk about the results of Payara-2 and what are the implications as we think about a potential Phase II in Guyana?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Arun. Well, obviously, this upsizes the resources quite substantially. So we've gone the range from 2.25 million to 2.75 million barrels of oil recoverable. So we are working with the operator now on planning and engineering studies underway for, obviously, additional phases of development. And as that comes to fruition, we'll provide additional information on those future phases. However, obviously, this increases the resources very substantially.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. We're reasonably confident the operator is moving forward with a second ship (38:02), and with these recent results, there's a strong likelihood we'll have a third ship (38:07).","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","But it's going to be phased over time. So it's going to be very manageable from a financial perspective. But the thing here it's going to give us an increasing resource base, put us on a very sustainable growth trajectory, but significantly lower our cost per barrel. That will give us resilient returns in a $35 or $40 [a barrel] world. So I think it's really going to advantage the company in terms of improving cash-on-cash returns once production comes on in 2020.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And my follow-up, John, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the potential for Hess to look at divesting some of your mature, higher-cost assets. Could you just maybe give us a little bit more color around that in terms of what you're thinking about and perhaps timing of when we could see something like this?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yes. No. Very fair. As we see, we're in the investment mode, which depending on oil price, may mean continuing having a financial deficit. I think it's very important to know that we will selectively use asset sales to fund that deficit. And you're talking about mature, higher-cost assets, very much as we did with our sale of EOR assets in the Permian. But the key thing here is our growth is underpinned by the four key assets we talked about: 70% of our CapEx, the Bakken, the two developments offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Thailand and Guyana. Our other assets actually do play an important role in the portfolio in terms of cash generation with growth potential as oil prices improve. But we will selectively look at some of those assets in the normal course of business if it makes sense to sell them to continue to optimize our portfolio, very much as we did with the Permian.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question is from down Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. A quick follow-up to Arun's question, if I may, so all we understand in Payara right now is that the rig is still in location. Can you speak, Greg, to the pre-drill and the prognosis for the deeper well (40:31) that was going to be targeted as well? Has that been penetrated? Or are you still on location?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. I might pick that one up, Doug, because we've coordinated this with the operator and our partner ExxonMobil. First, I think the most important thing here is the Payara-2 appraisal well was very significant. It confirmed a second giant oil discovery in Guyana and also increased the gross discovered recoverable resources just from Payara to 500 million barrels of oil equivalent. So it's going to be very economic. It's going to be a great investment and great return.","And the key opportunity we have there, as you know, was we were able to deepen the Payara-2 well by only approximately 300 meters, or 1,000 feet, to evaluate a deeper exploration objective, which provided a low-cost opportunity to evaluate a potentially material prospect. I can say now, this is the same position from our partners as well, the well encountered high-quality sands. They were water-bearing, but they had oil shows throughout. So the results were and are very encouraging, from both the reservoir quality and hydrocarbon system perspective, and evaluation of the well results is ongoing. And I think the other key point is there is considerable resources discovered to-date, but we see additional multibillion barrels of unrisked exploration potential in the Stabroek Block ahead of us.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate that answer, John, and maybe just sticking with Guyana very quickly, because the pacing of cash flows is obviously a question that folks are asking. When you look at the development scenarios, are you still comfortable that Liza early production phase essentially self-funds subsequent phases? And if you could clarify the tax position, because I understand that PSC was ultimately published by the press earlier this year, so if you could address that. And I've got a quick follow-up in the Bakken, please.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. So from the funding, you saw in our release, right, that it was approximately $950 million is the capital associated with the first phase, with $110 million already in our budget this year, going to $250 million, then to $330 million, and the remainder split between 2020 and 2021, so very manageable within our capital budget. And the way we think about it, although nothing has been set yet with the operator, but if you're going to get to our second FPSO, you're probably talking a two to three-year period from today where we'll really start the same type of process. So if you take a look at that same phasing, that phasing will happen again two years from now. And then we will have the production startup of Liza Phase I. And as typical in a PSC, you can begin to get your cost recovery of your cost bank. And that will help fund the second phase.","Now specifically on taxes, Doug, I am limited, because the terms are confidential, as you said. I know there's been some PSC leaked, but we can't talk about it with specifics, except to say I think, as both John and Greg have mentioned, that when we run out and you run out to like the Liza Phase I economics, this provides good returns down to $35 Brent. So, again, with the quality of the reservoir, the lower cost environment we're seeing offshore, and the combination with the PSC provides that good returns down to $35 in Guyana. It really truly is an exceptional discovery and development.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, John. My quick follow-up is to, Greg, very quickly on the guidance of the revised type curves in the Bakken. Does that include the higher proppant loading or just the move to 60 stages? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No, I think that when we said upsizing by 10% to 15%, that assumes a higher proppant loading as well. Now what I can't tell you, Doug, is are we going to settle on 120,000 pounds per stage, 140,000 pounds per stage, 130,000 pounds per stage. We're still in the midst of basically figuring that out. But the early results from the 11 wells that we have online with 140,000 pounds per stage is very encouraging. So that gives us confidence to say that this is a 10% to 15% uplift in the EUR. It also allowed us to increase our IP90s by some 100 barrels a day on average for the remainder of the year. So it's a combination of both.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Morris of Citi. Your line is open.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Greg, just following up on the Bakken question. You mentioned the 10% to 15% uplift in EUR, but looking at the IP90s in the second quarter versus the first quarter, those were up about 30% and I know some of that is the additional gas capture. But how much of that is just contribution from those 11 wells with 140,000 pounds per stage that may have been on for 90 days, I don't know how many were online for 90 days, but how would you reconcile the much higher uplift in IP90s you saw in Q2 versus Q1 for what wells were online?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah, okay. So a good question. So really the Q2 IP90 performance was very good because we're drilling in the core of the core, which is the Keene area. And that's really the best area that we have in the core of the Bakken. And those wells were actually performing even higher than what our forecast was. Now as we go into the second half of the year, we're going to move outside the Keene area with a couple rigs. They're still good wells. They're just not as good as Keene, but they're still very good wells.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Hey, Bob, the only other thing \u2013 I just wanted to add is those IP90s are only oil. Those are barrels of oil, so it has nothing to do with gas capture.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","That's true. Good point","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. So that's even better. All right. Great. Second quick question, you confirmed that in Guyana the next two prospects will be Turbid (47:01) and Ranger, given how fast these wells are drilling I would expect that you would have results on both of those by year-end. Would that be correct?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, obviously, that depends upon evaluation and kind of what you find. But yes, I mean, most likely we would have results in both by year-end.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons. Your line is open.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","Thanks very much. Just wanted to continue the discussion here on Guyana and the exploration program going forward and the multibillion barrel potential you all have talked about. Can you talk a little bit more about Turbid (47:41) and Ranger, what type of prospects those are? Where they might be located on the block? And then just at a high level, how are you thinking about that pace of that program through 2018, maybe how many exploration wells you might plan to target over the next 12 to 18 months or so?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah, Guy, thanks for the question. So let's start with Turbid (48:07), so Turbid (48:08) is very similar to Liza, meaning it's a stratigraphic play type that is on this rim of the bowl that we've talked about. It's to the southeast of where Liza is located. And then if you move to Ranger, Ranger is further out in the basin and it is a very different play type, which appears to be a carbonate buildup with on-lapping sediments, very large structure but they are very different play types. So again, Turbid (48:43) is more akin to Liza kind of a play type, whereas Ranger is completely different kind of play type.","As far as a go-forward on exploration, remember, we have until 2026 to explore on the block, so effectively nine years from where we are today. The pace for next year, you can assume a one rig kind of pace doing exploration. So that's about $150 million a year or so in net to Hess. And within that exploration campaign next year, there may be some more appraisals on Liza because we see more upside on Liza as well.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","Very helpful. Thank you. And then you all mentioned using or potentially looking at the portfolio and asset sales in part of the funding mechanism for shortfalls. Can you also talk about what the potential might be for drop-downs into the MLP type of cash that that could afford the parent? Just trying to understand at a high level the runway there, kind of what the ultimate opportunity for drops might be? How you might think about that just from a high level in terms of the pace as well?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. So I'll address that. And we do view this as a win-win for Hess and for our midstream business as well. So what we would be thinking of drops is nothing imminent that would go from the JV we have down to the MLP because this is a public entity because of the organic growth that both John and Greg have laid out that we had with our four-rig program.","What we are working with on our JV partner is we have within Hess still plenty of 100%-owned type midstream assets that we could put in the top-tier JV such as our North Dakota water-handling business, which we've spoke about. So that is something that can be dropped into the JV, and then later, so it bumps up the EBITDA runway at the top level and that asset then subsequently can be dropped into the public vehicle as the EBITDA growth continues in the MLP.","There are other assets that we have in North Dakota, other 100%-owned assets besides the water handling that we'd be looking to put in. And then we'd look across our portfolio, even including assets in the Gulf of Mexico, such as like our Stampede TLP. So there's other types of assets that we'll be looking at it and it will be part of, kind of, as I said, a win-win part of our funding in this lower-price environment for Hess, and it's giving more EBITDA runway to the midstream business.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yes. I think the key takeaway here is continued tight capital and expense controls, selective asset sales of mature higher-cost per barrel assets using the MLP as a future funding mechanism, altogether with Guyana and our growth opportunities that we're investing in put us on a trajectory to be cash generative in a $50 world once Guyana comes on. And I think that's the key takeaway and that's the objective for our company.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","And the last thing I'd add, Guy, to your question on the play types, these play types are also what we see extending into the Suriname blocks, which is why we've gotten an interest in two of those as well.","Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International","Very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. And...","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","... good to be back on the call after, I think, two years or something like that. Anyway...","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Welcome.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","...just to get to Guyana, the $35 breakeven, if I remember correctly, $40 was the number. Can you give us an idea of is it just the greater reserves? Or is there something else you detected in the appraisal wells that's helped lower that breakeven number?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","No. I think there's a number of factors why the breakeven is what it is. So let's start with the reservoir. Very prolific reservoir porosity, permeability, which means that your producers in Phase I are going to recover about 56 million barrels per well.","Secondly, the wells are very shallow. They're only about 12,000 feet to 13,000 feet below the mud line, and don't have any of the typical drilling things that you would financial in the Gulf of Mexico that require multiple casing strings. So the well costs here are a third, call it, of the Gulf of Mexico.","I think the third thing is that we're doing this at the low point in the cycle. So, FPSO, Surf, drilling, all those things are occurring at a low point in the cost cycle. And then finally, although we can't be specific, it has a good PSC that really helps you at these lower prices. So all four of those things contribute to the very low breakeven.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then to the Bakken just in general, the idea of you're in an outspend position obviously for the next couple years until Guyana does come online. As you think about I would imagine better well performance and maybe stable well costs, any desire to kind of step on the accelerator or to pull your foot off the gas kind of given let's say a sub-$50 oil environment just as a starting point for that?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Well, I think, as John said, I mean, the couple things that will govern that decision on certainly increasing the rig count will be oil price and the performance of these enhanced completions. I think in any case we're running the Bakken for value and for cash and not growth for growth sake, right. So I think that's a key tenet in how we're actually running the Bakken. Regarding decreasing the rig rate, I mean that is a potential opportunity if oil prices get low, even lower. That's a pin that we could pull if we have to. That's currently not our plan but obviously we could if we had to.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a...","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","At the current rig count we have, we're very comfortable being at a four-rig rate in a $40 to $50 world. I think that's a key point.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate that. And just a quick follow up on that. If you did have to pull back at all, any contractual limitations on that? Anything you're kind of locked into? You mentioned buying the sand in advance, but I was just curious if anything else was kind of nailed down or committed.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. So we've got our rigs committed for three years and pumping for two. However, all of those contracts have flexibility in them both on the up and the down. So no major issue if we decided to reduce rigs. But as John said, that's not our plan. We're very comfortable with four rigs in the Bakken at this $40 to $50 range. I think another important point on that, we have over 800 wells that generate an after-tax return of 15% or higher at $40 WTI flat. So we've got a very healthy inventory of outstanding return wells.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Good morning.","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, earlier you said that Bakken you're going to run based on cash and value. As forward program, can you give us a rough idea then what oil price you need in order for you to be cash flow breakeven from Bakken?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So we're at \u2013 at current prices, Paul, we're generating significant free cash flow from the Bakken. So it would, as Greg said, we've got 800 wells that give 15% type returns at $40. So, look, I know you and I have talked about this in the past. On a cash cost level for the Bakken, it is below our portfolio average. So prices would have to go significantly lower to cause us not to be breakeven, not to have free cash flow.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And, John, maybe I misread what you said. It sounds like you are saying that the Phase II for Guyana is going to be FID in 2019. Is that what you said because you're saying that the phasing of the next phase of the development would be two years out? Is that how I should interpret?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So what we were talking about is how the phasing of capital on a second phase. So this you really should ask the operator on the timing of that phasing. But now with the results of Liza-4 and it being so good and now Payara-2 again getting up to 500 million barrels, we feel pretty confident that there's going to be a second FPSO. So now it's timing with the operator is we sanctioned Liza-1 here this first one in 2017, so somewhere I was just estimating in a two- to three-year period it should be sanctioning the second one.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. I guess my question on there is more like (58:55) I thought we go for the early production in Phase I upon these (59:03) also using it as an extend or sanction test (59:04), I suppose. And you're going to incorporate that into the Phase II and Phase 3, if there is a Phase 3. And so from that standpoint, should we look at this such that you're not going to sanction it until the Phase I startup, or that you might actually sanction it say a year before? So I'm trying to understand, not trying to pin you down on the exact time, but the thinking that how the Phase I development is going to be used?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yes. So, I think, Paul, there will be dynamic data that we're gathering as part of Phase I, but you should think about that as a parallel path with doing FEED on Phase II. So as you're learning, as you're going, you'll incorporate those learnings because it's really going to come down to the dynamic data is going to give you learnings on the well behavior. And so that won't really make a difference until later in the project, the Phase II project. So parallel path, dynamic learning as you go and incorporating those as you are building and drilling Phase II.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And John, when you cut the CapEx by $100 million this year, is that a reduction the nature is (1:00:25) because some work being postponed? Or simply just on the efficiency gain, and if that's the case, is that all from Bakken or from where?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So, it really isn't an activity-based reduction. It really is efficiency and cost reduction efforts. I mean you've seen what's been happening on the cash cost side, so day-in and day-out we're focusing on reducing cost on the OpEx and capital.","And Bakken actually isn't the biggest driver of our CapEx budget reduction because we actually are moving, as Greg said, to the 60 stages in the higher proppant. What we've been able to do with efficiency there though is not increase the budget in Bakken even with moving to that.","So then it's more across the portfolio, you heard North Malay Basin did start up a little bit early, so we've had some reductions from North Malay Basin. I think you've been hearing where Stampede is, that it's out in the Gulf, so we've actually got some reductions there as well. And then the remaining pieces, it's just across the portfolio.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. My final question and just one comment. The final question is that if after the Stampede and North Malay ramp up to keep your production flat and the mix between oil and gas steady, any rough idea what is the annual CapEx requirement today based on that?","And the final one is just a request on the Midstream to see whether that you can continue to provide more of the segment detail breakdown in your press release. Thank you.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. Let me answer your second one first. The only reason we don't have the Midstream information in this press release because, as John mentioned in his opening remarks, is Hess Midstream Partners, now it's a public company, is having its first earnings call tomorrow. So after the Midstream earnings call tomorrow, we will post in our supplement all the Midstream information that we had previously provided. So we just didn't want to front run their earnings call.","As far as capital to maintain kind of our oil gas mix, our production type flat, the typical way I look at it is, take your number of barrels that you are producing in a year, this can be for any company, Paul, and then pick your F&D rate. If it's $15, if it's $20, so with us, if you're using anywhere a range of $15 F&D to $20 F&D, you're in that 1.7 billion to low 2 billion barrels to be able to maintain production at a flat range.","So it is there. With Guyana, obviously, we've got some low F&D type projects coming into the portfolio as well as Bakken. But over the long run, that's to me a typical way to look at how you can maintain your production flat.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Maybe just as we look into 2018 maybe a follow up on CapEx. As we think of the moving pieces on capital, can you remind us of and maybe as we think of the next, maybe even 2018 and 2019, how much spend will be rolling off versus incremental spend could be ramping? I mean, if we were to hold at a four-rig program, how low could the capital budget trend over the next couple of years?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Sure. So, assuming the four-rig program and let me just at least do 2018 versus 2017, so we have four rigs in 2018. On an average this year, we're going to be running three-and-a-half rigs in the Bakken. The other thing will be, for 2018, we'll be using right from the start, the higher stage counts and the higher proppant loading, whatever that level is. So Bakken capital will go up in 2018 for both those reasons, but not a tremendous amount, but there will be an increase there.","The other, let's just go what else would increase in the portfolio. As you know, the Phase I of Liza was sanctioned. We had $110 million in the budget this year. It's $250 million in 2018, so that will be where the other increase is.","Then offsetting those is both North Malay Basin and Stampede. So we have about $700 million of capital this year. Look, we will be providing guidance as normal in our January call, but you could look at somewhere around $400 million between the two on North Malay Basin and Stampede. So that will be a significant offset. We had some drilling going on in the Gulf of Mexico, which looks like will be reduced in 2018 as well. So hopefully, that can give you just general levels of where CapEx are and we'll update in 2018.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Sorry, and on North Malay and Stampede, is that it could be down $400 million? Or it could be down from $700 million to $400 million?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Oh, sorry. Yes, it'll be down from $700 million to $400 million. And then the only other thing I just remembered is with Valhall, we did start the platform rig a little bit later in 2017, so we'll be running that platform rig for the full year in 2017. So it could be a slight increase in Valhall's capital.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then maybe one follow-up on the Bakken, it's a great update there on well performance. Can you talk about how we should interpret those across the broader extent of your acreage and maybe across like the 2,800 wells of inventory that you talked about? Can you do the 60-stage fracs? Is that going to become the base case across the broader acreage position? And the 800 to 850 barrels a day of the IP90 rates, is that across the smaller subset in the core? Or is that broadly applicable you think across a larger portion of the 2,800 wells that you have of inventory?","Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Ryan, so the 60-stage will have broad applicability. So that has become our standard design now in the core of the Bakken.","Recall we've got about 1,500 wells that generate 15% or higher after-tax return at $50 per barrel. Now that number was based on our old design, 50-stage, 70,000 pounds per stage. So as we update our models, we expect that that number will get even higher of the number of wells that breakeven at 50. So breakevens are going down, EURs are going up, IP90s are going up, all of which bodes pretty well.","So the one piece of data that we can't be exact on yet is what is the proppant loading going to be? 140,000 pounds look good. We're trying to find the edge of the interference. We might back off a little bit from that, and hopefully by the end of the year and going into 2018, we can be more definitive on exactly what that proppant loading is going to be, but 60-stage is now the standard.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Greg.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Hey, Ryan, just to make sure I got the message out to you on CapEx. So with all those in and outs that I talked about here, you should not expect our CapEx really to be going up next year because of the reductions in North Malay Basin and Stampede and as well as the lower CapEx in the Gulf of Mexico, we'll be staying in the low end of that $2 billion range. So just to make sure I got that clear with you.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I know. That makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Hi, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, you referenced a tremendous number of moving parts, several of them very positive. And you've talked about, for example, $35 oil is a decent return for Guyana. But at the same time, you've referenced the current oil price as being a current low-price environment, which isn't suggested by the strip. Can you update us on the highest level on where you're aiming the company for in terms of the oil price that you assume, and what you're going to need just to break even in terms of your CapEx, your growth? What type of growth you would want at what type of price? And of course your earning? Thanks.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah. Paul, we're assuming $50 as the oil price that we're going to have for some time, and while we're in the investment mode now because of Guyana, and we earn very good returns in the future from that, and also the Bakken as well at the four rig count, we're putting the company to be in a position that when Guyana comes on in a $50 world, we will be cash generative.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","And could you just continue that into the Bakken, John, because I think in the past, you've spoken about $60. It seems that's changing, could you just update me on where that's going to be?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","From the Bakken, again, to make sure I get this out. Right now, at these prices or lower, the Bakken generates free cash flow. And, as Greg mentioned, we've got 800 wells, even at $40 WTI that generate 15% return. So, as John said, we do have deficits right now. Our target over that medium-term, once Liza comes onstream, is to be net cash flow positive, $50. That's post-dividend as well. And we believe we can do that while providing attractive and competitive rates of production growth and returns. So currently where we are right now, our cash flow from operations, say, in 2017 covers all our producing assets capital, and our dividend at these current prices.","As we move into 2018, though, our North Malay Basin and Stampede projects will become cash generators. So again that's going to help lower that deficit. And then what we'll do until Guyana comes onstream, is we'll continue to use our strong cash position, remember we have the Permian asset sale coming in the third quarter, to supplement our cash flow to fund those growth projects which is Bakken, we're going to keep with the Bakken and four rigs, especially at the current prices as you've heard, because it does generate good returns. And then Guyana and because of the value that both Bakken and Guyana generate for us, and we're past the development spend on North Malay Basin and Stampede, we can drive to have an increase in cash flow, free cash flow position post Guyana coming on in a $50 world.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. That's exactly what I wanted to hear. And could you just continue that into earnings please, John? You've mentioned and explained the slightly confusing DD&A that you mentioned earlier in the call. But when can we expect to see earnings positive?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Earnings is going to be the non-cash DD&A obviously, we have that high rate that we go on right now. Bakken and Guyana will continue to drive down that rate as Bakken reserves get added, and then as well as additional reserves we get booked with Guyana, and that production comes onstream. The exact point, Paul, I don't know. The breakeven on net income will follow kind of the cash flow, free cash flow numbers, so again it will be post Guyana.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. And then just as a follow-up, it seems that you're not being rewarded for a mixed business model that the market wants focus. When you talked about the potential for disposals, is there a potential for a major further restructuring so that you get rewarded for the quality of some of these assets without sort of mixing them and being diluted by the market valuation of mixed business models, which seems to be structurally lower for less focused companies? Thanks.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Yeah, with all due respect, Paul, when you model us versus I would say other companies that have balanced portfolios, I actually think we're holding our own. So I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but from the numbers we've run we're actually starting to get recognition that what we have in Guyana is truly game changing. In our investor pack we show that the returns it will generate, the EURs per well, the cost per barrel like $7 a barrel development cost is quite distinguishing.","And so when you compare our business model versus the pure plays, whether it's offshore or shale, we actually, I'd say, are probably holding our own in the middle of the pack, now we want to be at the top of the pack, and I think as we execute our strategy, we will. So I think that's the takeaway that I would respond to you with.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning, and congratulations on the continuing uplift in the resources offshore Guyana.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I just want to ask two quick questions back on the theme of the material asset sales. The first one being, just being an asset operator such as the South Arne versus being a non-op interest holder such as at Valhall, will that have any material influence on your thinking in the future?","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Well, I wouldn't want to speculate on any asset sales. Being an operator offshore is fundamental to our strategic positioning going forward. Being an operator in the unconventionals is fundamental as well. It also helps us when we are a partner with someone else who is an operator. So we're going to stay as an operator, both onshore and offshore. And whatever selective asset sales we have in the future, we'll be focused on maximizing value, bringing value forward and lowering us on the cost per barrel curve, and there will be some selective opportunities that we look at as we go forward to meet some of our funding gap to fund our growth opportunities. And remember, John Rielly pointed out that we'll be also looking at the MLP as well, or our joint venture above the MLP.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Right. No, that was very interesting color, I thought. Bearing in mind the desire to lower the corporate BOE costs, are there portions of the Bakken that could actually be a potential sale at some time if you needed it? And one reason I'm asking this is because I remember not too long ago there was a discussion about maybe experimenting with plug-and-perf and cemented liners and that sort of thing in the less than core acreage to see if, perhaps, results could be improved. So I'm just kind of wondering what you're thinking about the Bakken outside of your obviously identified core.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So just as an example, earlier this year, we did do a sale. It was approximately $100 million for what we were considering non-core acreage that we wouldn't get to because of the quality of our DSUs still sometime in the future. And so, again, it's an example. As John said, we're going to look where the value is. It was worth more to someone else because they were going to drill it earlier than we would, and we did do that sale. So what we do is try to work together with our midstream business to get the overall best integrated value that we can for both Hess and the midstream on our acreage. And so could further sales of non-core acreage happen in the Bakken? Yes. Yes, that could happen.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yeah. Hi. Just some quick ones from me. Greg, you said that the wells were running at about a third of Gulf of Mexico in Guyana. So what would be the completed well cost be? About $40 million or less?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","Hi, John. It's John. The well cost in Guyana, so we're not being specific; we've got to ask the operator. So what has been happening for us and the numbers that you know out there are on, let's just call it, a dry hole cost. If you're just going down to the bottom to TD on an exploration well, it's only net to us, like $15 million, okay? So gross that up, it's like $50 million for a direct dry hole. So then you get into on our exploration wells on whether we're coring or testing, there's going to be more. And then the overall development wells, the cost of those wells are baked into that overall gross $3.2 billion of the development cost, but we have not broken out individually the wells, and I guess that would be more for the operator to do.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. That's fine. In the Phase I, Greg also mentioned that there was 56 million barrels in recovery. So are you looking at about 10 producers?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","It's actually eight producers.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. Good. That's fine. And since you're on the phone, John, how much was, for the working capital changes, the incremental sand, the rig contract and the pipe-fill? Can you break it down?","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","So we weren't going to be specific, so what I would tell you on the two biggest were the DAPL line-fill. It was 1.2 million barrels that we had to, as part of our being an anchor shipper in DAPL. So that was the biggest. The next one was the rig termination payment that we had. It was the rig that was working on Tubular Bells, and we've completed that, and this was the last payment on that. So those two were the biggest and then the remainder is between the hedge premiums and the frac sand.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. Great. Thank you.","John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.","You're welcome.","John B. Hess - Hess Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."]}}
