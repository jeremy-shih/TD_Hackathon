At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thank you very much, Paul, and good morning, everyone on the call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Financial Services. On the call with me this morning, we have: Doug Oberhelman, our Chairman and CEO; we have Jim Umpleby, who will be taking over the reins from Doug as CEO come January; and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, everybody. It's Doug Oberhelman here and I just want to make a few opening comments and we'll get back to Mike and normal conference call stuff. I want to talk a little bit about the succession planning process the board used, just make a few comments on that. And we've talked about this before in analyst conferences and so on, but we have a very robust succession planning process that goes all the way down to almost the first levels of management. We review and spend a lot of time on that every year. And every year, at least once, usually in October, we go through that with the board for the, say, the top 300, top 350 people and talk about succession, the future, some names. And then, during the year, we try to introduce the board to a lot of those names and individuals, as we have been doing.","I certainly have been active in that. I was very adamant that I wanted, when my time was up, and I'll be 64 in February. When I retire at the end of March, I will be 64 years old, with just a few months to go before I'm 65, pretty much right on the process. There's no drama here contrary to a lot of stuff that's going around. But I was adamant with the board that I wanted a very good, sound process to use that they were happy with it, our executive office team was happy with it at the end and all the executive officers then would go right on through performance and not miss a beat. I think we've achieved that. I picked the timing.","I've been very much supportive of Jim. I'm very much supportive of the full executive office. And as we announced a week ago yesterday, I will be CEO until the end of December, and I will be Executive Chairman until the end of March.","We did make a change in governance with a split Chair and CEO role. I think most of you know we've had a shareholder proposal on that for several years in a row and we have a couple of large shareholders that are fundamentally for that. They push that at transition times. And obviously, this was a time the board considered that because we're in transition.","Dave Calhoun will be the Executive Chairman come April 1. I will tell you that I've had a wonderful relationship and extensive and also frequent with the current residing Director, Ed Rust. And we talk frequently before, during and after every single board meeting and have for years since I've been in the job. David's role will not be anything different than Jim. Jim will run the company and David will coordinate the board as Executive Chair.","Just a change in governance, both work very well. I've had great luck with the presiding director situation. And I'm sure Jim and Dave will have great luck with the split Chair, CEO role as well. Again, no drama, just a different way of doing things, and I think we'll carry on and not even miss a beat.","So with that little preamble, I will tell you I'm excited to move into the next phase. I'm very excited for Jim and the executive team that we have here. I feel the company is positioned. We've been through an awful rough period the last four years, as all of you have known and endured, but I do think we're set up for the future.","So, Mike, if you'd take over.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Actually, Jim.","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sure.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Caterpillar, Inc.","I'm sorry, Jim. I meant to introduce Jim Umpleby officially. And, Jim, so if you have a couple comments, that would be great. Thank you. Sorry.","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Doug, and hello again to everyone on the line. It's an honor and privilege to be selected as the next CEO of Caterpillar. I've worked with Doug for many years. I have great respect for him and am proud to be part of his team that has kept Caterpillar strong throughout some of the most difficult market conditions that we faced. Like other incoming CEOs, I'll pull together a team of leaders that will refresh our enterprise strategy in the coming months. Again, it's an honor to have been chosen to lead this great company. Thank you.","Mike, back to you.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","All righty, let's get on to the quarter and the outlook. Today, we'll be walking through a short slide deck, similar to what we've done for the past few quarters, and then we'll move on to the Q&A. Now would be a great time, if you don't have that slide deck in front of you, you can pick it up on our Caterpillar.com website, where the conference call Webcast link was.","Just as a reminder, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of that same Caterpillar.com website and it'll be in a section labeled Results Webcast.","So if you go to page two on this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. And I am quite certain that this morning, we're going to be discussing quite a bit of forward-looking information. And that always involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. In addition to page 2 of the slide deck, a discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in aggregate could make results differ can be found in our cautionary statements under item 1A, which is risk factors from our Form 10-K filed with the SEC earlier this year, and in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. Now in addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that are used in both our financial release and this presentation can be found in both the financial release and the last page of this slide deck.","One more thing, actually, before we get started on the slide deck, and I know that with Doug's announced retirement and with Jim replacing him, I suspect you have a lot of questions for Jim about his long-term strategy. But I would say since Jim found out he's going to be CEO just about 10 days ago, now is probably not the best time for those kind of questions. So what we're going to ask is today, we're going to try and keep the call here to our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and kind of our preliminary view of sales for next year.","So with that, let's start on the slide deck and if you could flip to page 4, and on page 4, that's the high-level summary of what happened in the third quarter to sales and revenues and profit. So we were down $1.8 billion in the quarter, continued on the same trajectory we've been most of the year. Profit per share dropped from $0.94 per share last year in the third quarter to $0.48 this quarter.","Quite a bit of that was from more restructuring cost. Certainly in the quarter, we had asset impairments, additional asset impairments, related to our Resource Industries business and restructuring costs were $226 million higher than a year ago.","If you exclude the restructuring cost, profit per share was down $0.20, which I think is pretty good performance on $1.8 billion drop in sales. And that'll be a theme, I think, across the next few slides that we talk about. Cost reduction was very good.","So if we go to the next page, it'll walk us through the change in sales in a little bit more detail. So the most significant decline was in Energy & Transportation. We were down a little over $800 million. And Transportation, in fact, this is I think the first time all year, we've said that oil and gas was not the most significant reason, but this quarter it was Transportation followed by power gen, oil and gas and industrial engines.","Resource Industries was down $465 million. That's a little over 25%, and it's been down about in that range every quarter this year, so not a big change. And it's actually split between mining products and large construction. We don't talk much about construction in Resource Industries, but we have large products like articulated trucks, some of the smaller off-highway trucks, some of the large bulldozers. Some of the large wheel loaders are used in construction and a pretty good decline this quarter in Resource Industries was from construction equipment. And we're seeing that, quite a bit of that, in North America.","For the Construction Industries segment, we were down $521 million. And again, about 2\/3s of that was volume. North America was the most significant region and about 1\/3 of that was price. So the total decline then is $1.8 billion.","So let's maybe flip to the next slide, page 6, talk a little bit about profit, this is our normal waterfall chart. So on the left, the black bar is the third quarter operating profit from a year ago. And then, we're isolating what caused changes. So you can see, without a doubt, that $1.8 billion decline in sales and revenues drove a substantial impact on profit from lower volume.","Price realization has remained a pretty decent-sized negative, about the same as versus a year ago, as last quarter; it was a $213 million this quarter. The next two bars are the positives, variable manufacturing costs. That's cost absorption. That's material cost. That's variable labor and overhead in our factories and that's been positive for all year. Period costs, we've done a lot of work to take structural costs out of the company. And we've actually performed very well on this all year long.","And then, a couple bars to the right is the restructuring cost. If you look at the decline in operating profit, about half of the decline was from the restructuring costs. So excluding restructuring costs on the prior page, you saw we were down $0.20. It's a little over $200 million in operating profit. And if you look at that price realization bucket, had we not been in such a difficult pricing environment this quarter, we would've had enough variable and period cost reduction to essentially offset the impact of $1.8 billion in lower sales.","Now, I'm going to ask you to do something I wouldn't normally do at this time. Let's just back up. Given that good cost performance, let's back up to the previous page one more time. So when we look at Energy & Transportation, their sales were down $818 million, but their profit on that level of sales decline was only off $111 million. I think that indicates great cost performance. Construction Industries, $521 million decline in sales and revenues, and $165 million of that was price realization. Despite that, their profit was only down $28 million.","Resource Industries, mining and large construction, down $465 million in sales, but their profit was down only $35 million. So I think that when you look at the change in profit in the context with the change in sales, it just reinforces the point that I made a minute ago that cost reduction has been very good so far this year.","So if we move on to page 7 and look at where we've been on cost reduction this year, you can see through the first nine months of the year were favorable, about $1.8 billion. And that breaks down into three major categories. The first is restructuring efforts. We've been on that path for a few years. We announced a fairly big series of restructuring actions last September.","And with all those actions, we've reduced square footage, capacity and people. Material cost has been favorable this year. And I know it's tempting to always think about that as just commodity-based, but the fact of the matter is we've gotten more cost reduction from design and sourcing-related changes than we have from commodity prices.","And then there's everything else and that includes short-term incentive pay. A little over $300 million of the $1.8 billion is from lower incentive pay this year, at least for our expectations. And so even without that, we're $1.5 billion of lower costs this year. So that's a little bit about the third quarter, again, a tough sales environment, very good progress on cost reduction across the board.","Let's look at the outlook. We did lower the 2016 outlook. Previously, we were thinking $40 billion to $40.5 billion for the year and $2.75 profit per share, $3.55 without restructuring costs. Now, we've lowered that. We think sales and revenues are going to be about $39 billion this year, and profit will be $2.35 a share, or $3.25 excluding restructuring costs.","Now, sales came down. So at the midpoint of the outlook, that's about $1.25 billion decline in sales and that came out relatively evenly across Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation.","Now, the decline for construction is particularly in North America. And the weakness in North American construction has impacted both our Construction Industries segment and, to some degree, Resource Industries for large equipment. So I think that's one of the bigger reasons for the decline in the outlook. In Energy & Transportation, we also took down rail. We had some business that we thought was going to ship in the second half, and it's been pushed out to later years.","And we've also had some decline in oil and gas and that's mostly from service and overhaul work related to Solar. You always have a lot of questions about Solar. We were thinking Solar was going to be down about 10% this year. It looks like, based on where we're at now, it'll be closer to 15%. And most of that change is related to service and overhaul work, not new turbine sales.","Power generation has also been down. It's been particularly weak in oil-producing regions. From a profit standpoint, our restructuring costs are about $100 million higher that we expect for the year. And most of that was from the additional asset write-offs that we had in Resource Industries in the third quarter.","So we don't normally give quarterly guidance, but when we get to this point in the year, we have three quarters of actual and we have a full year forecast, so it's pretty easy to figure out what we're thinking about the fourth quarter. And based on this outlook, it implies about $10 billion of sales and revenues, $0.47 a share of profit and $0.67 excluding restructuring. If we move to the next page, page 9, I'll walk you through why on higher sales, we think profit in the fourth quarter is going to be bit lower.","So if you look at the third quarter and the implied fourth quarter outlook, we have sales and revenue up about $800 million. Most all of that is in Energy & Transportation. We always have some seasonality in our fourth quarter sales, so this is probably not a surprise to you. We also have more locomotive shipments in the fourth quarter and particularly Tier 4 locomotives. And we have some large turnkey power generation projects in the fourth quarter.","Profit on that higher sales, excluding the restructuring costs, we think will be about $0.18 lower. And, of course, one positive is higher volume. We do have a substantial offset of the higher volume on sales mix. And this is also not, I don't think, very unusual over the last couple of years. That's been the case for us and we've had lower margins in the fourth quarter, and they've tended to rebound then in the first quarter. And we think that's likely the case here as well.","Cost absorption, one of the things that also happens commonly with us and it's partly related to the higher sales, we have usually a pretty good size inventory reduction in the fourth quarter. We are expecting that again this year and that we think will result in negative cost absorption.","We had in the third quarter, because we lowered the outlook, we had a favorable year-to-date adjustment in the third quarter for incentive compensation. We certainly don't expect that to repeat in the fourth quarter. So third to fourth is going to be negative for that. And then, another item that we talk about quite a bit in the fourth quarter is a bit of seasonally higher costs at year-end. And we don't have any reason to believe this year will be any different than prior years. So we expect a little bit of a cost increase in the fourth quarter.","So that's a little bit about the fourth quarter. Now, let's talk about 2017. That's page 10. Now, we usually provide a preliminary view of next year in our third quarter release, and so we're doing that again this year. It's always difficult at this time of the year to predict that. The year doesn't even start for a couple more months. But at this point in time, on balance, we're not expecting 2017 to be significantly different than 2016. That doesn't mean that it couldn't be different. That just means, at this point in time, it's a little hard to predict","We try to give you some insight into our thinking here by providing a list of the positives and a list of the things that we're concerned about. And on the very first bullet, you'll see they're kind of the same thing, and that is commodity prices. So, on the plus side, commodity prices have improved from earlier this year. And with like oil, for example, it seemed to stabilize somewhere around $50. And certainly compared with where we were, that's good. That's a positive signal.","On the concern side of that, we don't think commodity prices are still quite good enough to drive substantial sales increases next year. We would like to see commodity prices rise more next year. And if that happens, that, we think, logically would be upside for the second half of next year; if that doesn't happen, probably not upside then.","On the positive side, construction in China, that's been generally positive this year, both our market position. We're doing a bit better than most of our competitors. And the market there has improved, and that's been good for us. If you look at today's release, for example, the one up sales increase that we have in our release is in construction in Asia. If memory serves me, we were up about 9% there. And we think as long as there is continued support for growth in China, that next year can be up as well.","Construction sales in some other developing countries, particularly in places like Brazil where it's just been a very, very challenging situation, CIS is in that category, too, been a very, very challenging year for both: Brazil, because of deep recession; Russia, and actually much of the Middle East as well, because of low commodity prices. We kind of think that sales in many of those countries may have bottomed. And there's every opportunity to think that in places like that, we could have some upside next year.","Then, around mining, and this is a bit related to the commodity comments earlier, it looks to us like the CapEx forecasts are flattening out. And sentiment amongst customers and dealers has been a little bit better, and that's good.","On the concern side, in addition to commodity prices, North American construction in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, is weaker than we would've thought a few months ago. And if that continues, that would be concerning next year as well. Hopefully, with all the election noise behind us and particularly if we get some investment in U.S. infrastructure, that could help, but right now, I would think, on balance, it looks pretty tough.","Economic growth in Europe, it's been kind of okay, but we're still concerned about Brexit. And as that draws nearer, the concerns that we have are does it impact economic growth and business confidence and investment.","I think another fallout from the lower oil prices has been power gen, particularly in the oil-producing regions. It's very weak now. And we don't see anything in the short-term that's going to change that around. And also, kind of related to commodities, in a way, marine, particularly for offshore service vessels, we're concerned about. And rail remains a very weak industry, particularly in North America. And industrial engine sales to Ag customers, that's loose engine sales that we sell to Ag customers and particularly Ag and some power gen packagers, remain pretty weak.","I know with Solar, it's always a topic of discussion, so I thought I would give you our current view of Solar as well. So right now, we've had a pretty stable backlog. Based on where it's at right now, it would give us expectations that Solar would be about flat next year with this year.","I know you're concerned about how this will play out by segment. And I would tell you that it's not a lot. I mean, when we say not significantly different than 2017, by and large, that's probably pretty similar across most of the segments.","I would say probably slightly more negative with Energy & Transportation than, say, Resource Industries, which is at such a low bottom. I mean, new equipment sales for the big mining product is down 80% to 90% since 2012, not as much room there for downside.","So with that, we'll just wrap up with a few discussion points on page 11. Not much change over the past quarter in the industries we serve, with the exception of North American Construction, which has disappointed.","We've had great operational performance and that's not just cost reduction. Our market position vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors was better this quarter than a year ago for our machines and continues to improve in China. Our decrementals in every single segment were very good year-over-year, and that's driven by cost reduction, which is quite substantial.","We're pretty well on track with restructuring. Most of the things of any magnitude that we were considering a year ago in September with that announcement, have been made public. Balance sheet remains strong. Our ME&T debt-to-cap is 37% at the end of the quarter. And we had a cash balance of over $6 billion and we're still thinking that this year will be a positive free cash flow.","So with that, I think we're ready to turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. And the first question is coming from Andrew Casey. Andrew, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Wells Fargo Securities. Good morning, everyone.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Morning, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","On 2017, can you review some of the puts and takes we should consider when looking at the year, in addition to the revenue outlook you provided today?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then, also, given the market outlook is pretty flat, are you considering any incremental cost removal actions?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, so as we said on sales, I will start with that. On balance, we're not seeing a significant difference, but we've said this in the release. I think we're much more cautious about the first half of the year. And the flattish for the year relies on a bit of improvement in the second half of the year. So I think to your point on costs, I would suspect as we wrap this up, we will be planning and trying to set a cost structure for something that's probably a little bit more conservative than where we're thinking sales for the year could be. So there will remain a very big focus on cost and cost reduction.","I won't get into too many of the details yet. As you know, we're kind of in the middle of our planning process for next year right now, but I think some big things that you can certainly expect, one, we'll have a big headwind. I don't know how much yet, but we'll likely have a pretty sizable headwind on incentive compensation. This year, we're off of our outlook in most areas, off of our plan. So we'll have a less than expected short-term incentive comp this year for all of our employees. And something more normal going into next year could be a headwind of $500 million, $600 million, depending upon where the executive team and the board sets the target.","So that would be a headwind. On the positive side, we've done very well on costs. We've taken out more cost as we've gone along this year. So we'll have some benefits from a carryover impact of that. So that should be a tailwind. We've done very well on material costs. And, again, much of the commodity benefit in the material costs with the rise in commodity prices has come out. But even without commodity changes, we've done very well on sourcing and design with material costs, so I think we would see that as a tailwind for next year. So we're still working on all the other items in the plan. And when we get to January, we'll definitely do a more complete review of sales and the profit drivers.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And if I could follow up on the guidance for this year, the $3.25, I think in the past, a $3.55 included some benefit from change in pension OPEB policies. Is that still in the $3.25 and how should we view that in 2017?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, essentially, the change that we made had the impact of taking out prior-year amortization of gains and losses related to the assets and liabilities in the pension plan and better reflects what the, I don't know, I guess I would call, actual ongoing pension costs. So it's not that there's a big benefit. I think it's just stated more around what the actual expenses for the year. And we made that accounting change effective the beginning of this year, a couple of prior years where we stated. And we're going to maintain that, certainly that accounting treatment.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Sameer Rathod. Sameer, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Macquarie. My question's on excess capacity. It seems like rationalization, normal rationalization, isn't really happening, given the excessive liquidity provided by central banks. Does Cat think deflationary pressures or pricing pressure will continue in this environment or does it somehow naturally abate or do you think M&A is the only channel for supply rationalization?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sameer, I heard all the words you said. Is it a question on our pricing or what we tend to fix? (34:00)","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Caterpillar has indicated excess capacity being a problem for price realization. My point is if there's excess liquidity, zombie corporations, so to speak, not going out of business, does price realization continue to deteriorate?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Okay. I get it. Okay. So our pricing over the last couple of quarters, it's certainly unfavorable to a year ago, but it's stabilized from what we see going forward over the next quarter anyway. In fact, we had a Q&A in the release on this. We don't see the pricing environment actually getting worse. Saying it's not getting worse doesn't mean that it's good. Kind of maintaining it at this level is actually a pretty significant negative to our results. It was a $200 million drag on the quarter. But we don't, at this point, see it getting worse from here. It's pretty tough overall, but barring some large event in the world economy, that we're certainly not expecting, I think we would see, from this point, at not very attractive levels, stable pricing.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jamie Cook. Jamie, you line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, Credit Suisse. I guess my first question, I appreciate the color on the fourth quarter revenues as well as the EPS and why the EPS is lighter, but can you just give me a little more color? Have you changed your assumptions in terms of where dealer inventory should be at the end of the year and Cat's inventories relative to your previous guide? Because I think what everyone is trying to get a better understanding of is as we approach 2017, what's your confidence level that we should start to produce in line with retail demand, given where we are today?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So I guess that's my first question. And then also, you mentioned a couple times about your 2017 revenue assumption, the first half is weaker versus the second half. Back to how we will be producing relative to in-line with retail demand, is the second-half improvement you're assuming the markets get better? Or is there some change in what would be normal seasonality in terms of production for Caterpillar? Thank you.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yes. Predicting dealer inventory precisely is always difficult, but I think, based on where we've been year-to-date, and what's likely, I think, in the fourth quarter, and this will be a plus or minus probably a couple hundred million dollars, but probably something around dealer inventory in its totality around $1.5 billion decline this year, with probably somewhere close to half of that coming out in the fourth quarter of this year. So we are not currently producing to end-market demand; this year, order of magnitude, $1.5 billion lower.","Now, when you start talking about next year, I'll tell you what makes it really difficult to predict. How we'll end the year will depend a lot on how the second half of the year turns out and what expectations for 2018 are. So, for example, if things start improving in the middle of next year and there's confidence that 2018 is going to be a better year, part of dealer inventory is thinking about what's going to be needed for the future, not what was needed in the past. So that would tend to help dealer inventory.","If 2018 looks bad, if there is some sort of a world event and dealers are more pessimistic, there'd likely be some additional dealer inventory reduction. I think we'll be probably be in a better position to talk about that maybe more in January, but I would say in our current estimates, we do continue to have some level of dealer inventory reduction in for next year. I guess, at this point, let's just call it a placeholder, but probably not as much as this year.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So in a flat environment, we'll still be under-producing retail demand next year?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","I would say so, yeah.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And is there any way you'll give color? I mean, know it's not the $1.5 billion. Would it be considerably less than that? And can you talk about which markets they would be targeting? And I guess the second question on that is why not just get it all out of the way, Mike, this year versus have this be an issue into 2017?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, we don't control dealer inventory. Dealers are independent. What they decide, it's not up to us. It's up to dealers on what their confidence level is. They're the ones selling to end customers, so it's not something that we can force to be behind us. And it's also very seasonal. Dealers will want to likely build some inventory in the first quarter for the second quarter selling season, so it's not as simple as you might think.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then buckets on where it is, is it just mining and construction, construction?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, it's been mining, construction and some E&T this year. It's been across all three. I think construction for the year will probably be a bit more than the other two. (40:08).","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Ross Gilardi. Ross, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, good morning, Bank of America. Thank you. Mike, I've tried this one for a few years in a row. I'm going to try it again same time of year. Cat, I believe, has got $3.6 billion in goodwill still residing in its mining segment. And as you mentioned in your formal remarks, as we know, new equipment sales are down 80% to 90% since you bought Bucyrus. Your annual impairment testing, I think, is coming in the fourth quarter. I'm not asking if you're going to write it off, because, obviously, that's an auditor decision, but if you did write off the $3.6 billion in goodwill, would it potentially jeopardize either the dividend due to stipulations on shareholders' equity in your borrowing agreements or negatively impact your credit rating?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, those are big questions, so I'll try to talk around it rather than giving you a direct answer, because our credit rating is up to the rating agencies. But first off, if we knew what the result of the fourth quarter goodwill testing would be, we'd book it. We don't. We go through a defined process every year. We're going through that now. And we're pretty straight up. If there's an impairment, we'll book it. If there's not, we won't.","In terms of the effect on the company, that would entirely be a non-cash item. It would affect equity, of course, but it's a totally non-cash transaction. I can't imagine that would impact the dividend.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But in terms of not having it written off up until now, I mean, how could Cat say that the assumptions around what it's worth on a discounted cash flow haven't changed materially since the time you bought it and put that goodwill on your balance sheet to begin with?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, that's a longer discussion. First, there is no Bucyrus. Bucyrus does not exist. And the goodwill is not in one measurement bucket. We measure goodwill. We do the work based on which of our business it's in and that goodwill is spread across more than one business. And also remember that some of the intangibles in goodwill changed after we acquired Bucyrus and sold a portion of it to dealers. So some of it left already. In our K last year, we provided more color on goodwill. And the segment that's the closest a year ago to triggering an impairment, I think if memory serves me, it was about 15% off. That segment houses about $1.2 billion of the goodwill.","So we don't have a Bucyrus. Everybody wants to think we do, but it's been integrated in across a couple of different businesses within the company. And so the measurement is not just Bucyrus, because it doesn't exist. It's each of those businesses that we have. That's how it's done.","So I don't know if we'll have an impairment or not. I'm not saying we will. I'm not saying we won't. We just have to go through the process and we'll know in the fourth quarter. If we do, we'll book it. If we don't, we won't.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from David Raso. David, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","Evercore ISI. Good morning. I was just trying to think about the cadence and confidence in the 2017 outlook. When I look at the orders, right, the orders are down about 10% year-over-year, and they have to grow about 5% sequentially just so the fourth quarter orders are still down just 10%. Can you give us some color what you're seeing currently on your order trends and how to think about those numbers with that cadence for 2017 sales? Because, again, we need orders up 5% sequentially to still be down 10% year-over-year starting next year.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, David, I think I'd have to write all this down on a piece of paper to follow what you're saying, but our backlog from second to third quarter didn't change much. I think in Construction, the backlog is in most of the products, outside of maybe China, is fairly weak. I think we don't normally have a long backlog for businesses like Construction. That product ships in the range of 8 weeks to 15 weeks. So you don't have a long backlog. I said a minute ago, dealers are planning to cut inventory in the fourth quarter. So I think naturally, they're ordering less. We would certainly expect a pickup in orders in the first quarter as they want to build some inventory for the second quarter selling season.","In the case of Solar, backlog is reasonable, and based on everything we know about history, should be reasonably in line with a flat year next year. So how confident are we in next year's sort of preliminary view? I think we're confident that the first half will definitely be challenged. And I guess if you want to read into that down, I think that's probably a reasonable way to think of it.","How confident are we that the back half of the year will improve? I think that will depend largely on what happens to the U.S. economy, U.S. construction, and whether or not this trend of maybe parts sales firming in construction happens, and whether or not we start to see orders from mining companies, which we haven't seen much of so far. We're encouraged by the commodity prices, the sentiment, the discussion on CapEx, but probably to the point that you're making, that has not turned into orders of any magnitude yet. So our confidence in the year does rely on a pickup in orders going forward, hope that helps.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","I mean, to be healthy, you'd need (47:12) a lot of mining orders to turn that into a big positive year-over-year. So I mean, six months, nine months out is far enough out, I appreciate.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","It could go up in the second half nicely, but I'm just trying to think what we have visibility on in that kind of three, six month kind of view, that the orders sequentially, and, again, I'm just giving you the numbers, if orders are flat sequentially, we're still down 14% year-over-year going into 2017. And I'm just trying to get a feel from you, are you saying your orders sequentially right now feel flattish, up or down, just for some perspective?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","No. Yeah, I don't recall disclosing orders. So I'd have to look at your math. We'd have to talk about it offline, as orders aren't something that we disclose. And when you look at orders, you definitely have to consider how much is aftermarket, how much is not aftermarket. The length of the order board for parts is about two days. The length of the order board for rail can be two years. So it just depends upon the product in terms of what it means for the short term.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","And one last follow up, the R&D, you didn't mention on the year-over-year puts and takes, I would've thought the R&D, which is already running down 14% for the third quarter \u2013 it was down 11% the second quarter \u2013 would be an area of cost savings for next year. Is there a reason you didn't highlight it?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. And the reason I didn't highlight it is because we're not done with the plan for next year. And one of the things that we have to address between now and the time we do talk to you about profit is in places where we have discretion on timing of spending, what we're going to prioritize and what we're going to do. We're not through that yet in the planning process. That'll come over the next probably six weeks or so.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","But it's fair to say it should be a positive? It should be down next year is a fair directional assumption?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","I tell you what, I'm going to avoid saying that, because we've not been through that sort of resource allocation discussion yet within the company. I mean, I can understand how you would think that, and that may well be the case, but before I get us positioned on that, I think we need to get through our planning process.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","I appreciate it. Okay. Thank you for the time.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Robert, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. It's Barclays. Congratulations to Doug and Jim. Doug, we've written that the work that Cat has done under your tenure on competitive positioning, production systems, market share, it's going to pay off for years and decades to come. So congratulations.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, thank you, Rob. I appreciate that.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","This is a little bit of a lower-level question, but SG&A was really low in the quarter, really good, great cost control. And obviously, the incentive comp was part of that, but even if we take incentive comp up like $100 million, like it seems to have been the first two quarters, you're still at $630 million, $640 million or something like, very, very low levels. What else was abnormal in SG&A? And what is the sort of indication on sustainable run rate from the quarter?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, the incentive comp was definitely an abnormal, if you will, in the quarter, a good guy. Outside of that, I'm not aware of anything in the quarter that was of any materiality, unusual or weird. I mean, there's always some discretion in some of the expense that you have, and there's always some timing issues. Like, I'm quite confident that SG&A costs might be a bit higher in the fourth quarter, because of timing. But there's nothing that I'm aware of that is anything that's significantly, outside of the incentive compensation, negative.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Would you hazard a guess on the total? I mean, I understand the work you're doing on product design, but the total raw material benefit for 2016 at this point?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","2016, honestly, I don't remember the total number, but probably a good couple of hundred million dollars, maybe.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Maybe a little bit more than that even.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm done. Thanks.","Operator","Okay, the next question is coming from Joe O'Dea. Joe, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. It's Vertical Research. First question, just on pricing and what's embedded in early expectations for 2017, I think when we compare it to the pricing announcement from late September, which had a pretty wide range, but flat to up 4%, and then based on experience this quarter, just how you're thinking about pricing from an overall perspective in 2017?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yes. That's a good question, Joe, and when asked for the puts and takes for next year, I was silent on price realization. So on the positive side, we did put list prices up for machines in the range up some, none, some as much as 4%. We don't provide any kind of a weighting on that. So it's a little tough for you to know what an overall average is for that. And then even that, that's just machines. So that wouldn't have aftermarket in it, and that's not Energy & Transportation either. But I think the fact that we had a 0% to plus 4% range, you can look at and think of that as a bias for a little better price.","The flipside of that is price realization. This year, we did not take list prices down, but we have negative price realization. So the market will be what the market will be, regardless of what we put out in list price changes. I think at this point, I didn't talk about it as a headwind or a tailwind. And I think that probably describes, at this point anyway, how we're thinking about it.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. And then, specifically on construction inventory in the dealer channel, could you give any context around historically how many months of inventory dealers have wanted to carry there and what they're carrying now, and maybe where you see that going? With the point of the question really being how big an impact Lean manufacturing has been for you, what kind of a comfort level it gives for dealers. And so there's destock related to end market, but then there's also destock on efficiency, and just how much more of that we could see?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, and I wish we were able to break down all the reasons and causes for everything that goes on within dealer inventory. There's usually a reasonable band in terms of months of supply and you kind of have to look at it in a band. It's not a static kind of expect \u2013 it depends a lot on is the bias up or is the bias down on future sales, because that'll color a lot what dealers hold. How we're, to your point, how we're shipping? Are we meeting shipping commitments? Are they relatively quick? Can they get what they want when they need it? And so that kind of puts a downward bias on what they want to hold as well. The flipside of that is if we're on allocation, they want to order as much as they can get and they want to hold as much as they can keep.","So there's not a hard and fast rule, but somewhere in the sort of maybe 3 months on the low-end, 3.5 is probably a reasonable band. And for the most part, we're in that band. And you have to even take that with a bit of a grain of salt because it depends upon kind of what the product mix is of what's being sold. So if it were all small machines that we sell, that we can provide delivery on in eight weeks, that provides a little different dealer dynamic benefits. Big machines would take six months. But I guess the gist of my answer would be I don't think there's any massive excess of dealer inventory. I think we all would like to get dealer inventory down.","It's just more efficient for us and dealers if we can deliver quickly what they want, what they need. And in an ultimate world, wouldn't it be great if they didn't have to have any inventory? And we could just ship them everything in one day. Unfortunately, that's not the case, but you're always striving to do better.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Mili Pothiwala. Mili, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. It's Morgan Stanley. My question is on the comments you made on North American construction, particularly some of the weakness you mentioned you saw over the past quarter, call it, that's caused you to be a little more concerned on the outlook in 4Q and into next year. Can you just elaborate on kind of where you're seeing that and what caused you to get a little bit more concerned?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, so if you think about our business in construction, the heavy construction and rental are pretty decent-sized businesses for us. If you look at construction in North America, housing seems to be motoring on and has been okay. The problem we find ourselves in, I think, is the larger projects, the infrastructure, the infrastructure spending is maybe not quite as robust as housing would be right now, and that's a bigger sweet spot for us. We have this other dynamic going on and I'll try to describe it like this. We have too much used equipment in the marketplace right now, and used equipment prices are fairly depressed.","And so what that causes in rental, particularly with our rental channels through Cat dealers, is it does not provide much of an incentive for dealers to sell off their used equipment and refresh fleets. So we're seeing our sales into the rental channel as pretty challenged right now.","And I talked about construction equipment in Resource Industries, in particular, articulated trucks. We had quite a bit more rental loading earlier in the year than we've seen here in the back half of the year. So, I think, hopefully, sentiment will improve. We'll get the election out of the way. We'll have a new government that's interested in infrastructure spending. And somewhere six months to a year down the road, maybe that'll turn into something better but right now, I think we're on the fence and concerned about overall construction in North America.","Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up, I think in the past, you've talked about for 4Q within Resource Industries, kind of a breakeven outcome as being a possibility. Is that still how we should think about 4Q today?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","For Resource Industries? I'm sorry. You cut out for just a second there.","Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, for Resource.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, I'm going to avoid getting into the segment guidance. I think that if you look at what they did in the third quarter, it was very, very good on sales that were over, I think, $465 million lower. Their operating profit only changed, I think, $24 million or $25 million quarter-over-quarter. So they had a pretty darn good third quarter. If you look at our overall outlook for next quarter, we have lower profit on slightly higher sales. We have a cost absorption headwind in the fourth quarter, and I'm sure that'll hit RI. And we have usually a little higher seasonal costs, and so I'm sure that'll hit RI. So I would not be looking for RI to do better on profit in the fourth quarter.","Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. Thanks.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Mili. Okay, we have time for one more question, and then we'll wrap up.","Operator","Okay. The final question is coming from Ann Duignan. Ann, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, JPMorgan. And, Doug, I just wanted to say we have always appreciated how visible and accessible you've been, regardless of our weighting on the stock. So we appreciate that, and we hope Jim will continue this practice.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thank you, Ann. I appreciate that also.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. And my question is around steel prices, raw material prices. We're looking at significant increase in some of the steel costs year-to-date. Mike, can you talk about how that might weigh on your outlook going into 2017? I mean, it's a positive for maybe the mining side, but should we expect a headwind on the gross margin side?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","So I don't think it would be much. I mean, if you go back over, not so much this year, but a couple of years before it, we had higher material cost reduction. Part of that was sourcing and design, and part of that was commodities. The commodity piece of it has mostly evaporated this year. The cost reduction that we're getting is mostly sourcing and design. That will continue. But I think higher commodity prices will mean not so much a headwind on material cost in total, because we'll still have considerable sourcing and design changes. We're always out there doing that, but I think it'll be certainly less of a \u2013 at this point in time anyway, I'd say it'd be less of a tailwind as we look into next year. But now all that said, we would take higher commodity prices in a heartbeat. I mean, if we had to decide between high commodity prices or low commodity prices, the impact on our sales would beat the impact on our material cost substantially.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, I can appreciate that. And then a quick follow-up, because I know we're out of time, the variable cost reductions, $584 million year-to-date, is the way to think about modeling those variable cost reductions is that they come back into the system with revenue, because they are, i.e., variable?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, there are a couple pieces of that. One is material cost reduction is a pretty good-sized chunk of it. And you'll just have to make your assumption about what you think it'll do, material costs will do, going forward. The other piece of it is our inventory reduction this year has been a little bit less than it was the prior year; our inventory, not dealer inventory. So the cost absorption headwind hasn't been \u2013 it's still been a headwind, but it's not been as much of a headwind as it was the year before.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there any way to quantify that?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, I mean, between the two of them, it's been positive $600 million this year. And so, I mean, you can use that as your starting point for the year, and then just use your own judgment. Do you think we're going to get more material cost next year? Or as you started out the question, do you think that commodities might be too big of a headwind for us? I think what we've done this year is probably a reasonable starting point.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So variable cost reduction, no head count in that?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","There is also period and variable improvement there. But we've had some of that going both directions. When volume goes down, that's usually a little dicey for efficiency. We've done a lot of work to help offset that impact. And then, recently in Belgium, efficiency has been less favorable than it was before, certainly. So the bulk of the variable cost reduction we've got this year has been the cost absorption in material.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate that and, again, good luck, Doug.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","All right, thanks.

At this time, all lines have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Mike DeWalt","","Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I\u2019m Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar\u2019s Corporate Controller. On the call today I\u2019m pleased to have with me our Chairman and CEO, Dough Oberhelman; and Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.","This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., and any use, recording, or transmission of any portion of this call without our written consent is strictly prohibited. If you would like a copy of today\u2019s call transcript, we\u2019ll be posting it in the Investor Section of our Caterpillar.com website, and it\u2019ll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","Now, this morning, undoubtedly we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. Our discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate, could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1-A, Risk Factors, of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of this year, and also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release.","Now, in addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in our financial release, and again that\u2019s been posted on our website at Caterpillar.com.","Now, before we start the Q&A today, I\u2019m going to be covering three main topics. The first will be a summary of our second quarter results and revised outlook. And then I\u2019m going to take a few minutes and talk a little bit about our business segments and then I\u2019m going to finish up with cash flow and the stock repurchase that we talked about this morning.","So I\u2019ll start with second quarter, which I\u2019m going to discuss in two ways. First, I\u2019m going to cover at a high level our second quarter results versus the second quarter of 2012. And then I\u2019m going to discuss the specific headwinds that we faced in second quarter and how we are thinking about them going forward, and our expectations for the second half of 2013. First, compared to the second quarter of 2012, our results this morning were quite a bit lower. But to put the year-over-year comparison in context, the second quarter a year ago was certainly a tough comparison. The headline from last year\u2019s second quarter started with Caterpillar reports best quarter in history.","Sales this quarter were \u2013 sales and revenues were $14.6 billion and that\u2019s a 16% decline from the second quarter of 2012. And this morning, we reported profit at a $1.45 per share and that was down $1.09 from the second quarter of last year. Now the sales and revenues declined versus last year and dollars was about $2.8 billion and about half of that was the result of dealer inventory changes and the other half from lower end-user demand. Now in last year\u2019s second quarter, dealers bought more machines from Caterpillar than they delivered to customers. And their machine inventories rose again last year about $300 million.","In the second quarter of this year 2013 it was the reverse. Dealers bought less from us than they sold to the customers, and their inventory of new machines as a result declined about $1 billion. So in combination, the impacts and the changes of dealer machine inventories was negative by about $1.3 billion for the quarter-over-quarter. The remaining sales decline was the result of lower end-user demand for machines and to a lesser extent, power systems. The decline in profit was largely a result of that drop in sales.","And on page 6 of this morning's financial release, we have a waterfall chart that would step you through the quarter-to-quarter changes in operating profit. It shows a decline in total from last year to this year of about $1.59 billion and lower volume, which includes product mix more than accounted for the total decline in operating profit.","So the overwhelming story on a quarter-to-quarter profit decline was volume. And I think the waterfall chart covers the other pluses and minuses reasonably well. So I'm going to change gears a little here and talk about the headwinds in the second quarter and how we are thinking about them relative to the second half of the year and we'll start-off with dealer inventory.","As I mentioned before dealers took out about $1 billion of inventories in the second quarter. And that was a sales headwind for us as our sales were about $1 billion below end-user demand. In terms of what that means for the second half of the year, well we expect that to continue. We think dealers are going to take inventory down another $1.5 billion to $2 billion or so between now and year-end.","The continued dealer inventory decline, in fact is the main reason that we lowered our sales and profit outlook for 2013 this morning. We're expecting sales and revenues in a range of $56 billion to $58 billion, and profit of about $6.50 a share to middle of that sales and revenues range. That's a drop of about $2 billion on the top line and $0.50 a share at the bottom line. So, dealer inventory reductions where headwind in the quarter and the main reason we lowered the outlook.","Now our inventory was also a headwind in the quarter. In addition to what the dealers took out, we cut inventory by $1.2 billion in the quarter. That was negative to profit from a cost absorption standpoint. And just to help you get a handle on the profit impact, we use a rule of thumb of 13% to 15% of the inventory change.","The year-end expectation for our inventory is that it will end the year about where it ended the second quarter. That means we do not expect the profit headwind that we had in the second quarter from inventory absorption to continue in the second half of the year. In addition, we also had a substantial currency headwind in the second quarter. And in this context, I\u2019m not really talking about year-over-year, I\u2019m not talking, I\u2019m not comparing the second quarter year-ago. I\u2019m talking about actual translation and hedging losses with a lot of $134 million that happened in the quarter and were reported in the other income and expense line of our P&L, which is a couple of lines below operating profit on the P&L.","Now as we put our outlook together, we don\u2019t forecast future currency movements. We do our outlook based on exchange rates as they are. As a result, our outlook does not expect currency translation and hedging losses in the second half of the year like the $134 million in the second quarter.","Now the flip side of that is we did have a positive item in the quarter. We had $135 million gain on our settlement related to the Siwei acquisition and that\u2019s also something that we don\u2019t expect to repeat. So as we\u2019re thinking about the second half of the year, kind of relative to the second quarter, the average sales for each of the two quarters on a quarterly basis in the second half, it\u2019s about the same as the second quarter, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have the negative cost absorption impact like the second quarter had. We don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have the $134 million at least in our outlook of currency losses, and the Siwei $134 million gain, we don\u2019t expect to continue.","The other difference that you need to take into consideration is that we\u2019re taking additional actions to reduce costs in the second half of the year. Now, we started taking action in the second quarter, and began implementing cost reduction measures and we\u2019re going to do more of that in the second half of the year.","Okay. that\u2019s enough for now on the quarter and the outlook. I\u2019d like to change gears just a little bit and talk about segments. I\u2019m going to start by saying that our largest segment this year by sales has been Power Systems. Our most profitable segment this year has been Power Systems. The highest margin rate of any segment this year has been Power Systems.","Now I know that most of you are on the phone here today already know that, but there are many casual observers of Caterpillar that if you ask them that question, what is that mining, which is in our Resource Industries segment. The point of this discussion is that we serve a number of different cyclical industries, but thankfully, they don\u2019t all follow the same path at the same time. The diversity within and in fact, between our segments have to mitigate year-to-year swings in sales, both down and up for the company.","The Power Systems segment again; our largest and most profitable segment over the past five years has also been relatively speaking the most stable of our two large equipment segments. and that\u2019s because it spent a number of different industries itself electric power, oil and gas, rail, marine and industrial engines. And actually, even within those industries, there is diversity, in oil and gas for example. Our sales of engines for drilling and fracking are weaker and gas compression continues to do pretty well.","Moving on, our Construction Industries segment sells an extensive range of construction equipment around the world to support infrastructure development, commercial and residential construction. The worldwide construction industry is showing signs of recent improvement that remains relatively depressed from a historical standpoint. Construction in the United States well starting to turn up, it\u2019s still far below the 2006-2007 peak, and the construction equipment and industry in Europe is as you\u2019d expect well below the prior peak, and construction equipment sales in China in 2013, we expect to be about half of they were in 2011.","The point is, there is a lot of room to grow, just to get back to where we\u2019ve been before. When economic and construction activities begin to improve in the world, particularly in the U.S. and hopefully, eventually in Europe, it should be a positive for our business. Our Financial Products segment is also important to our business and it\u2019s doing very well. It provides financing to end-users that purchase our equipment and it also provides financing for some Caterpillar dealers. Financial Products revenues and profit have proven to be much more stable through the business cycle than our product related businesses, and they\u2019re currently performing well. Revenues this quarter were up 5% from the second quarter a year ago, and profit was up.","Now the segment that\u2019s currently getting significant attention is Resource Industries, which is primarily mining. Now I\u2019m going to give you one down of what\u2019s happening in mining. But before I do that, I\u2019d like to point you to today\u2019s financial release. And on page 16 in particular, question number five in the Q&A in the back of the release, we\u2019ve tried to provide a pre-comprehensive discussion of the mining industry and how it impacts our sales. Now the high points of that discussion start with the production of mine commodities and the underlying health of that mining industry relies on commodity demand and production, and based on the data that we\u2019ve seen, it looks like mining production in 2013 is going to be a little higher than it was in 2012.","And recently a couple of the big public mining companies have reported they\u2019re producing at record levels. Now commodity production underpins the need for mining CapEx. And despite 2013 increases in commodity production, it\u2019s clear that mining companies are currently cutting their CapEx after significant increases in 2011 and 2012. While we don\u2019t specifically accumulate CapEx estimates ourselves for the industry, we do the follow the market surveys. Based on those surveys, it appears total mining CapEx in 2013 is likely to be down 5% to 10% from 2012. And those some surveys are also indicating further CapEx decline near 20% for 2014.","Now the mining industry CapEx includes spending on exploration and developing, buildings and structures and things like processing plants and equipment. At Caterpillar, we\u2019re mostly impacted by spending on equipment, while we don\u2019t have a consistent CapEx yield at that level of detail for the industry worldwide; we have reviewed data at the level of details from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and it tells us that over the past few years, the largest and fastest growing category of CapEx in Australia was four buildings and structures, and while this is the largest category, the most significant declines in 2012 have been for exploration and development and equipment and based on our own experience with large capital projects that makes sense to us. It\u2019s difficult to stop construction on large-scale facilities once they get substantially started. That means in the short-term, we believe that more of the decline in mining CapEx is for equipment, things like Caterpillar machines.","It now leads us to end-user demand for our products. That\u2019s how much CAT dealers are actually delivering to end-users of mining companies. Year-to-date deliveries to end-users and our expectations of what dealers will deliver for the full year are declines of about 20%. While dealer inventories are down \u2013 while dealer deliveries, I\u2019m sorry, are down, for the type of equipment that we make we believe we are doing a little better than the equipment industry overall. And that brings us to resource industry sales. So we started with CapEx, we\u2019ve moved onto end-user demand from our dealers and now to our sales.","And to relate the decline in mining equipment demand placed on our dealers or sales need to consider several other factors besides mining CapEx. Our resource industry segment includes things that are not directly related to mining CapEx like aftermarket part sales as well as equipment sales to the forestry, paving and quarry, and aggregate industries. Although, resource industry sales of aftermarket parts are down a little in the second quarter of 2013 compared with the year ago, the decline is much less than the decline for equipment and in the context of the total decline in sales, the resource industries is just not a significant factor.","And the collective sales of equipment for forestry, paving and quarry and aggregates, are also down, but again, the vast majority of the decline in resource industry sales for the quarter, the second quarter of 2013 is mining equipment.","Now, in addition to those factors to understand our sales, we also need to consider dealer inventory changes. Dealer inventory increased in the second quarter last year and it declined substantially in the second quarter of 2013. That means that last year we were selling more products to dealers than they were delivering to the end-user and mining companies.","And in the second quarter of this year, we sold far less equipment than dealers were selling to mining customers. In fact, our sales of traditional CAT Mining equipment such as mining trucks, large track excavators and wheel loaders would have had to vend more than 50% higher in the second quarter to match what dealers were delivering to end-users.","In the second half of 2013, we expect that dealers will continue to substantially reduce their inventories. And that means we expect to continue to undersell mining demand for the remainder of 2013.","Given the substantial decline in sales in 2013, the uncertainty around when cyclical recovery will resume, we\u2019ve taken substantial action to adjust our production levels and to reduce costs. We expect to take further action in the second half of the year. Now, our intention is to reduce costs and drive operational improvements and do it in a way that doesn\u2019t significantly reduce our ability to ramp up when production improves.","I know many of you would like to get a better understanding of what we think will happen after 2013. Now, we're going to discuss that here for a couple of minutes, but we want to start by saying, we are not providing sales outlook for 2014 either for resource industries or for CAT in total. It\u2019s certainly too early to do that. And the activities over the past five years in the mining equipment industry certainly reinforced that. It has experienced significant demand shifts, goes up and down in the mining industry overall has had difficulty in forecasting those shifts in advance and frankly, that\u2019s impacted our forecasts.","We understand that as a part of being in this industry. And this year is a good example as mining companies have been cautious and dealers have reduced our inventories. What we will discuss here this morning is what the industry surveys, not our forecasts, but what the industry surveys about next year suggest and what that could mean and the impact of dealer inventory reductions wind down.","Now, earlier I mentioned that, we\u2019ve seen surveys that suggesting another 20% decline in the mining CapEx in 2014 from 2013. Again, that\u2019s not our estimate, and we\u2019re not providing an outlook. But if you take that CapEx survey at face value, it suggests another down here in 2014. To put mining CapEx in the context of our sales though, you have to consider the impact of dealer inventories.","Even if dealer deliveries of new mining equipment were to be down 20% next year from 2013, if we see an end to the dealer inventory reductions over the next few quarters. We believe our sales of new mining equipment to dealers would be positive. In other words, we believe the significance of the end of dealer inventory reductions would have a more significant positive impact on year-over-year sales than our 20% decline in end-user demand.","Just to clarify this, we\u2019re not suggesting an increase in inventories next year. Just the absence of the big declines in 2013 that pulled our sales well below what dealers are delivering to mining customers.","Now, in addition to that, if the world economy continues to improve, we would expect commodity productions to also increase and that coupled with the relatively large number of new machines placed in service over the past several years, that should be a positive for mining aftermarket part sales. Again, this is not a forecast for 2014, this time, too early to do that. The preference of this discussion was just to illustrate for you the significance that dealer inventory changes are having on our mining business today and what the implications are for when the decline comes to an end.","Now, looking further ahead, our long-term view of mining remains positive. Commodity demand is driven by economic growth, population increase and the rising standards of living, and we believe that will all continue to improve over the long-term. In addition, declining ore grades imply that in the future more material will need to be moved per ton of commodity output, and that\u2019s another positive, at least, from our perspective for long-term equipment needs.","Finally, much has been written and said about the impact of China on commodity demand in the mining industry. Our long-term view of China is also positive. We expect continued urbanization and improvement in standard of living for the people of China. We believe that means more electricity production will be generated and increased production and consumptions in general.","Now, increasing electricity production in particular is a positive for coal. Coal makes up a large portion of the electricity generated in China and they continue to add coal fire capacity. Now that said, we do not expect the significant economic growth rates that China experienced over the past 10 years will continue indefinitely. But we do believe that China will continue to grow at a much faster pace than the rest of the world. And it\u2019s also important to remember that over the past 10 years, the size of the Chinese economy has more than doubled, and that means that economic growth rates of 7% to 7.5% had a greater impact today than a 10% growth rate would have had 10 years ago. It\u2019s a big economy that relative to the world in total is growing faster.","So in summary on mining, we don\u2019t expect much change in the environment in the short-term and the remainder of 2013 will be tough for our mining business. As dealer inventory reductions come to an end, our mining equipment sales could rise from 2013 levels, even if mining CapEx declines. And our long-term of mining remains positive. the world needs mine commodities. As the world grows, we believe commodity demand will continue to increase.","One last quick topic, and then we\u2019ll go on to the Q&A, and that topic is cash flow and cash deployment. While it was certainly a tough quarter for sales and profit, our Machinery and Power Systems operating cash flow was better than it\u2019s been in a long time. We generated $3 billion worth of the operating cash flow in the quarter, and that\u2019s a substantial increase from $1.3 billion in last year\u2019s second quarter, and we\u2019ve put that to work for stockholders.","In the second quarter, we have repurchased $1 billion of CAT stock and we announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend. And in this morning\u2019s financial release, we announced that with the strength of our cash flow, balance sheet and cash on hand, we expect to repurchase an additional $1 billion of CAT stock in the third quarter. Repurchasing stock in the downturn has been a key part of our cash deployment strategy and we are executing on it.","So with that, we are ready to open up the floor for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Hey, it\u2019s Vertical Research Partners, thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Let\u2019s see \u2013 let me just start with our systems, since you did highlight that division, I mean, you had one of the strongest margins you\u2019ve ever had. And wanted to just check in on whether you are seeking or actually just whether that was a mix related, I know power gen \u2013 backup power gen has been awful whether it\u2019s structure improve in the margin or division and then whether you are seeing any change in electric power?","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Yeah. If you look actually Rob, the dealer statistics that we put out yesterday morning, you can see that\u2019s a little bit better than it was a year ago. I think a lot of that has to do with \u2013 it was a kind of even turned down a year ago. So I think a little bit on powers \u2013 on electric power in particular, the comps will probably just continue to get little easier.","I think for power systems overall, they had a pretty down good quarter. Sales volumes down a little bit, but some of the pieces were up. I think more of their profit improvement had to do with a little price realization and they\u2019ve done a pretty good job on cutting costs. As opposed to power system, as opposed to construction and resource industries, they didn\u2019t have near the decline in inventory that those other two segments did, so the absorption impact was relative to the company in total lots more for them.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","I\u2019m not sure, if this is one you are willing to or able to answer, but is it possible to look through the turmoil that\u2019s gone on in resources over the past six months, and think about what\u2019s your margin would be in a more stable environment at these volume levels?","Mike DeWalt","Well, you are right, I\u2019m not going to throw out a number. But I think in my opinion, we had a one positive item the Siwei settlement would be in their numbers, if you would have to take out, that would actually make a little bit lower. But we are in the middle of pretty heavy inventory decreases and that in total, the amounts that they are really underselling real demand and the absorption impact probably more than offset that.","In sense, we are moving from, let\u2019s just say, higher volumes over the last year to lower volumes this year. Cutting cost is not a process, and that\u2019s going to continue into the second quarter. So if for example, volume, end-user demand kind of hung in at this level. Our sales would probably go up a little bit, because we would stop cutting inventory. We wouldn\u2019t have the Siwei adjustments in there, but costs would likely be lower as we\u2019ve \u2013 as where part rates grew kind of the cost cutting activities that we\u2019ve been doing.","So I guess my part is that would probably be a little higher than it is now, but I don\u2019t know that I would want to throw out a number.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","I guess that was my two. Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning, JPMorgan.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Good morning. I\u2019ll start out with the decremental margin question. Doug, you\u2019ve been pretty vocal about driving for 25% pull-through. Can you talk about the decrementals this quarter whether they were disappointing or not to you and are we going to get back to 25% by year-end?","Brad Halverson","Hi, Ann, this is Brad Halverson, and it\u2019s a good question. If you look at the second quarter, I think there is a couple of things if you look to the right up to consider in terms of results. On it\u2019s close to 70% of our drop in sales, are mining which is negative for mix. But even putting that to a side, if you just look at the period cost absorbed kind of impact, you get to a decremental margin slightly under 30% and we\u2019ve talked about 25% to 30% kind of a decremental margin in terms of our target.","So for the quarter, you will get slightly under 30%. If you look full-year at our outlook, even with all the headwinds you\u2019ll get to a decremental pull-through of 24%. And this was something that we spend a lot of time on, internally. We have targets that we\u2019ve committed to. And if you look across our segments Resource, Construction, Power, Financial Products each of them, as we talked about before, have made a commitment as to what they\u2019ll make at certain volume levels, which ties to our external commitment and they are executing on that. So when we get through the end of the year, we\u2019ll be at 650 right around 24% which is, with the mining headwind I think a good number.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Fair point. Thanks for the clarification. It\u2019s normally in the press release, but it wasn\u2019t conspicuous either today. My follow-up would be on pricing and you also mentioned in the press release some negative pricing, I think it was in resources in Australia. Can you talk about pricing overall and where you are seeing the most price, obviously probably in mining, but why would we be giving up pricing at this point in the cycle?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, again this is Mike. Just a couple of comments, I think when we talk price realization here it\u2019s versus the second quarter a year ago and again, I don\u2019t want to harp too much on this, but we had an absolutely fabulous quarter a year ago. Price realization in the second quarter last year, kind of everything came up heads and we had just about $500 million reported for last year, which was pretty close to a third of the whole year.","So, I think to start the discussion off, it was \u2013 in total and in particular for price, a pretty tough comparison. we did have slightly negative price realization well less than 1% for Resource Industries and for Construction Industries. For Construction Industries, it was mostly in Latin America, and we have a few big deals going on down there that had a little tighter pricing. And I think for mining in general, it\u2019s a tough market out there right now, I mean volume is down quite a bit, and it I think by and large, we\u2019re pretty close to holding our own again with a slight reduction in the quarter compared with a really big quarter a year ago.","I don\u2019t\u2019 think there\u2019s any big fundamental shifts. You didn\u2019t ask this question, but I\u2019m going to answer it anyway. As a part of this updated outlook, before we were kind of talking about 1% of this year, we\u2019re not far off that, and I think we\u2019re looking at just a little under 1% for the full-year for the total company this year. So it was a little tighter I think in the second quarter, but pricing didn\u2019t overall go down. it was helped a little bit by better number at Power Systems.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, wonderful. (Inaudible) so I will turn it over. Thanks, guys.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Thanks.","Brad Halverson","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Gilardi. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Ross P. Gilardi \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, Bank of America, thank you. Mike, in talking about mining, there is an awful lot of focus dealer destocking and the business as the big source of paying, but this is a major order business. So I mean, isn\u2019t the real fundamental issue that the miners are just canceling orders and as long as that remains the case, you are not going to see much of a pickup in production and margins unless until you see a pickup in orders?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, Ross, that\u2019s actually a great point. And one of the things I think that has been impacting orders, remember we don\u2019t take orders directly from the mining companies, we take orders from the dealers, the dealers take orders from mining companies. So if you look at the destocking inventory, I think that\u2019s certainly having some impact on the dealer order rates to us. So we definitely would like to see order rates pick up, but I think certainly until we get through the inventory reduction, there will probably a drag at least on orders placed on us.","But to your point, I\u2019ll just kind of go back to it. I talked about the surveys that suggest mining CapEx down another 20, for that to be the case, I mean, orders have to pickup. I mean, if dealers don\u2019t order anything or, I\u2019m sorry, customers don\u2019t order from dealers and dealers from us don\u2019t order anything or don\u2019t order more, then 20% is just not, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the cards. That would look like an optimistic number. So I think for mining CapEx next year to be down 20%, they have to order more, dealers would have to order more from us than they are today. Maybe I am not trying to make that overly complex, but to say that even at 20% decline in mining CapEx considering the dealers ought to be out of inventory here pretty soon, would have to mean more orders placed on us, and that\u2019s a better way to say it.","Ross P. Gilardi \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, Mike, and then you mentioned in the discussion of resources in the press release that that acquisitions and divestitures negatively impacted operating profit by $33 million in resources and I believe that\u2019s with $135 million gain from Siwei in there. So is that $33 million a year-on-year swing in earnings or should we assume that BUCY is loss making at this point?","Mike DeWalt","No, no, no.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","I think what you need to do is go back in our second quarter release from a year ago, one of our Q&As in the back of that release had quite a bit of detail on Bucyrus and included in there we had pre-tax gains on the sale of the Bucyrus distribution, we had some big ones. So basically the gains from last year on the sale of Bucyrus distribution to some of the big dealers more than offset the $135 million this year.","Ross P. Gilardi \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I got you. Just related to that though, have you had an impairment test for Bucyrus yet and if not, is there a next test coming up to do that annually?","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Yeah, we do that annually. I want to be careful on how I answer this. If you do an impairment test, it looks forward to what you think you\u2019re going to generate in that business over a longer period in time and we certainly wouldn\u2019t be using a cyclical low straight line going forward. In our mining business, I think there is reasonable headroom, I certainly don\u2019t want to predict what a test would be, but I think the chances of an impairment there are probably not, it certainly not like, but\u2026","Ross P. Gilardi \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ashish Gupta. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Ashish R. Gupta \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, it\u2019s CLSA. I believe in the past that Doug mentioned that China is not overexcavated. Now I\u2019m wondering kind of what the pickup in sales we\u2019ve seen recently. I\u2019m wondering how to think about the machine population over time, now they are moving to more to maintenance from infrastructure. I\u2019m just wondering how you guys view the long-term machine population in China, relative to some of the more developed economies?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. I mean this is the case where there is a short-term story, there is a long-term story. I think clearly, if you look at long-term, I mean I know the market doesn\u2019t like to look out this far, but if you look out at a point where China is developed, say today to the level of Japan or South Korea or Europe maybe, the excavator population, the construction equipment population in terms of equipment relative to the economy currently is a lot lower than those developed countries. So as the standard living wise is there at the level of development, builds out over time, the population of equipment in China will certainly need to grow. I guess the big question you have is, will that take three years, five years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years. And I think that depends a lot on the scale of China\u2019s growth.","From our perspective, I think it\u2019s going to grow. I mean our view is it, it\u2019s probably I guess the second biggest economy in the world today and it is growing at a faster pace than the rest of the world and it\u2019s important, it\u2019s going to grow and this level of development is going to grow. And I think as a result of that construction equipment industry, there it\u2019s going to need to grow.","But it is true when we see that in our part sales in China. As the population is increased and the equipment gets used, it has driven part sales up in China over the past few years and as that population continues to develop that\u2019s a trend that will probably continue.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","","Yeah, Doug Oberhelman here, I\u2019ll just comment a bit on China as we see it in particularly as I see it. I\u2019m not one in the camp of a China implosion that that China will implode and drag the world down into a massive black hole. I think what we will see in China is very healthy with a much slower rate of growth and I would call it 5 to 8, they say 7 to 7.5, so be it, but that means the maturing of that market for construction equipment and all kinds of things. And as that economy is double to the last decade, we\u2019ve seen our fuel population of machines grow and grow and grow, allow parts and services opportunity for our dealers. And our business model plays well with that.","And that's exactly what we\u2019re trying to do. We\u2019ve also been working hard on market share in China and that is up and we\u2019re quite happy with that. And as that year-over-year sales are up that is for all of our business in China are fairly substantially.","So, we\u2019re going to see China go in fits and starts. Obviously and I have said this before to many that, I hope we don\u2019t see another double-digit burn. The after effects of that and the residue is painful for everyone, 5% to 7% 8% growth rate is just fine. We\u2019ve sized our business for that. We\u2019ll do very well with that particularly trying to get to a leadership position in market share, and that\u2019s really the way we see China overall. Mining certainly, is an opportunity there. we\u2019re working on that, and much of that is underground as you know. we now have an underground offering to work with. So a long-term, China and mining are appealing to our short-term. we go through cycles and we\u2019re certainly in that downturn at the moment.","Ashish R. Gupta \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.","","Thanks for that, Doug. Just one quick follow-up, when you guys look at your global fleet of machines with GPS data, can you help provide us with some sort of indication of what you\u2019re seeing globally by region?","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Ashish, I\u2019d like to give you the answer to that, but of all the myriad of data that I made sure I was up to speak on, before I came in here today, I didn\u2019t look at that. So I don\u2019t\u2026","Brad Halverson","We can\u2019t do it regionally anyway, but overall machine operation is service meter units on the fuel population that we have monitored today are relatively steady and have that. And I think as we look back a few months. So overall, that\u2019s a worldwide number including the U.S., China and everywhere else in the world. So it\u2019s hard to say that regionally.","Ashish R. Gupta \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","It\u2019s Barclays. Good morning guys.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Hey, Andrew.","Brad Halverson","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, so if you look at your press release, one of the things that you said is, you believe it\u2019s unlikely that dealers will continue to reduce machinery, machine inventory in 2014. So maybe, Mike if you can talk about your conviction level on that statement, this is first down cycle of that you\u2019ve had with your PDCs, with your product distribution centers. so I guess what I\u2019m wondering is, is there anyway to look at the overall inventory in the channel between the PDCs and the dealers to get a read on whether you think inventory is low enough that you can sort of make that statement, because it\u2019s hard for us, because the PDCs are relatively new development.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Yeah, yeah. That\u2019s actually a very good question, Andy. If you just look at dealer inventories, they\u2019re really today, really on the lower side of the historic range, actually, really on the lower side. If you include PDC inventories right now, the sum of the two is probably right kind of maybe, more in the middle of our reasonable range. and we\u2019re looking for continued dealer inventory reduction through the rest of this year. I mean we\u2019re looking at somewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion coming out in the second half.","So further from here, I mean mining inventory probably be at about half the level, but it\u2019s started the year and construction down some. Now your question about conviction level, as in all things, it depends upon what the economy does that our sales forecast for next year ends up being and we don\u2019t have that. But if you look at just where months of supply are or the severity of what\u2019s happening, and particularly in construction it\u2019s trajectory of the way the sales chart looks. I think there is a pretty reasonable conviction that dealer inventory is certainly not going to have the kind of declines that it had this year. and probably, I guess at this point, I think it would be, we will have a pretty reasonable conviction that it\u2019s not going to go down certainly at least much next year. But again, I\u2019m going to qualify that, because it depends a lot upon what happens to sale, as into some degree, when it happens next year.","Mike DeWalt","Now, just a couple of other comments; dealers are using PDC quite a bit more this year. The usage rate, the percent of dealer machines that are coming out of PDC is actually quite a bit higher in the second quarter than it was last year. So it looks like dealers are using PDC inventory and that\u2019s a good thing. However, delivery times for product to dealers compared with a year ago are much less and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s probably a surprise, so that\u2019s happened. So I think there is a pretty reasonable conviction on dealer inventory that\u2019s going to slow or stop.","Andrew Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Mike, it\u2019s fair to say then that at the end of this year, when the dealer inventory comes out as you expect that the addition of PDC plus the dealer inventories would then be at the low-end of your historical range versus dealer inventories in the past?","Mike DeWalt","Well, that will dependent upon what our forecast for the first quarter sales is, because when we look at it, months of supply is kind of related to the forward-looking sales estimate for the quarter. So since we don\u2019t have that out there right now, it\u2019s a little bit tough for me to just say that. But I think our expectation is it would certainly be in the range, yeah.","Andrew Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then if I could ask a follow-up on Resource Industries\u2019 margins. I mean, I know people are already hitting you on that. I guess, the issue that we have is the decremental margin in that particular business looks exceedingly low, and you\u2019ve talked about really accelerating cost takeout in 2Q. Is it possible to quantify how much cost takeout you really started in 2Q in terms of expense, so maybe we can sort of pass-through why the decrementals were so low. I know you are going to tell me that mix is negative also.","Mike DeWalt","Well, mix is certainly negative for the total company, because more of the decline was mining. But we introduced this concept of profit curves inside the company, demands of the business, and each of our three segments have a positive curve. In other words, if sales goes up, there is an expectation of a certain amount of profit, when sales goes down, there is an expectation that only that much will come out. And so there is basically, think of it as an incremental and decremental margin rate for each segment.","And the take-out rate for mining is a little higher than the 25% that we look at for the total company, and that\u2019s probably not as fast. So we are trying to take actions on costs that will allow us to get as close as possible for that, sort of curve decremental margin rate.","So they\u2019ve been, I\u2019m not going to quantify for you, but they\u2019ve been doing \u2013 rolling lay-offs, rolling temporary lay-offs for salaried management, employees. We\u2019ve taken R&D down a little bit. And the things that we\u2019re going to do in the second half of the year, we certainly haven\u2019t announced to our own employees yet. And so the specifics on that are probably going to start coming out, I would guess over the course of the next month or so. So it\u2019s probably better to talk about the specific items after that, but definitely we\u2019re planning to take some more action here in the second half of the year.","Now, one thing that and this is through the first half of the year and this will ease in the second half of the year, it\u2019s particularly earning decremental and that just period cost absorption. I mean, we added a lot of inventory in the first half of last year and in the second half. I\u2019m not talking dealer inventory, I\u2019m talking our inventory. And this year\u2019s first half, we\u2019ve taken inventory out. We took about $0.5 billion out in the first quarter. We took $1.7 billion up this quarter, and that does primarily impacted construction and resource industries.","And the more vertically integrated you are, the larger the impact is on your business and that's been a particular negative for Resource Industries in terms of incremental. There was a positive last year and negative this year. It's not really an operational item. When you think about it, it's not operating efficiency. So as the inventory declines start to slowdown, that should be a little better in the second half.","Andrew Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","And for that segment the decrementals to inventory reduction would actually be higher than 13% to 15% as you said for the whole company?","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Yeah. We\u2019ve not given out a number overall, but if you think about it the absorption thing is basically down to fixed costs that essentially get absorbed in and released from inventory, when you build and sell inventory. If your entire business was just buying and selling material, you wouldn't have a lot of value added to absorb. Then the businesses where you are a lot more vertically integrated, you would have more and I think Resource Industries is probably a little more vertically integrated than Construction, for example.","Andrew Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Jamie L. Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hi, good morning, Credit Suisse. I guess just two quick follow-up questions. Under your new forecast, I think, your forecast implied that mining OE would be taken down about $7 billion, what are your assumptions under your new forecast, because I\u2019m just trying to back into what mining OE will be as a percentage of total sales as we exit 2013, because I actually think that would be most helpful as we all have different macro assumptions or assumptions on mining. But if we can get a sense of what mining OE would be, I think that would be much easier for us. and as I calculate it could be as low as 10% or as high as 15% and I\u2019m just wondering how off I am? And then I guess my second question, Mike, last quarter, I think you said, your core mining business would be down 50 [but you see] 15 and then aftermarket flat, just can you talk to what your new assumptions are? Thanks.","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, again, if you look at the last outlook and this outlook, the main driver of the decline is dealer inventory. So I mean that\u2019s the biggest driver and that is machines. So it\u2019s a combination of Resource Industries and Construction. What we\u2019re looking at in the back half of the year is probably more slanted to Resource Industries. So I think proportionately of the decline in the outlook, more of it would have been Resource Industries certainly than Construction. And actually, Power Systems is sort of flat to slightly up in the outlook.","Jamie L. Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay, but you didn\u2019t answer the question on\u2026","Mike DeWalt","No, we don\u2019t disclose new equipment separately from aftermarket in our results. So I can\u2019t really give you mining equipment number separate in Resource Industries. We still don\u2019t disclose it that way. I am not trying to (inaudible). What I am trying to tell you is it, whatever your current estimate is probably the majority of the decline in the outlook, and when I say majority, I mean, more than half in this context, would be Resource Industries for equipment. They have more of the defined and dealer inventory in the second half.","Jamie L. Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And then any change in your assumption, so do you see this turning what you saw at aftermarket, can you just talk to those relative to last forecast?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, I think directionally, both of those numbers are kind of the same, but remember when we were talking about the 50%, that's not end-user demand that's what we\u2019re selling to dealer's.","Jamie L. Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Yes.","Mike DeWalt","And that has been impacted, of course, by the dealer inventories, so that means that our sales of the traditional product is down. The Bucyrus product is down a little bit, but I think that\u2019s sort of proportion that you used with Bucyrus sales holding up much better than the traditional CAT product, is absolutely true, and a lot of that is because the dealer inventory impact is much more pronounced for trucks and dozers and wheel loaders, then it certainly is the Bucyrus product.","Jamie L. Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And then the mining aftermarket?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, it\u2019s holding up pretty steady. We had a really strong first half last year. Coal mining was still doing okay and then it\u2019s kind of started to tail off a bit in the second half of last year, but our expectations for aftermarket this year haven't really changed.","Jamie L. Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Mike DeWalt","(Inaudible) that you would be concerned about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","David M. Raso \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","ISI, I\u2019m just trying to gain some comfort with the second half implied margins. if you pull out the settlement gain in 2Q, the margins for the year so far about 8% and 9%. the second half of the year is implying more at 11.5% to 12% operating margins. So when I think about how to bridge that gap, basically to find about 300 bps of margin improvement. you are looking for sales growth of about 7% sequentially first half to second half. and I can get a decent amount of margin improvement with a pretty healthy incremental margin on that sequential build increase, but can you help us a bit with the mix to better understand the incremental margins, the overhead absorption benefit. Where do you see the 7% sequential increase, which businesses maybe geography, just help us a bit, we\u2019re trying to get a feel for how much could the incremental margins be, the overhead absorption benefit, what could it be on that sequential improvement?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. I think when you say incremental margins; you are talking about kind of from the first half to second half.","David M. Raso \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Yeah, I\u2019m talking sequentially.","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, yeah. I think there are three big things that are driving that. one is just the absence of negative inventory absorptions. and if you start with the premise that the second half of our year, if you look at the implied guidance at the midpoint on sales and revenues, it has sales in the second half of the year averaging about what they did in the second quarter, but up a bit from the first half average. so volume will be some hope, and we would certainly expect our reasonable incremental margins on volume. I mean I\u2019m not talking massive, but our kind of target range is around 25%, and so incremental margin on volumes, second half versus first half a little better. I think the second thing is absorption that was a pretty big deal in the first half, and in particular, in the second quarter, we have $1.2 billion inventory declines.","so that had a pretty sizable effect. And I think the third thing is, to get to a point where inventory is not going to go down further, our production needs to go up. And that\u2019s certainly the case, particularly for construction. And so that are to be positive for this efficiency in general. And then we have cost reduction activity, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to do it. We haven\u2019t really \u2013 particularly because we haven\u2019t announced it internally, any specifics, but we\u2019re going to take additional actions in the second half of the year to lower cost, so volume from efficiency as production goes up, absence of the large negative cost absorption impacts and some additional cost reduction.","David M. Raso \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","But where is it coming, you mentioned construction, but if you had to handicap, the 7% increase in revenues sequentially first half, second half, is the increase mostly in Construction, is it Power or even suggesting Resource Industries sequentially better. I\u2019m just trying to get a feel to better gauge those incremental profitability?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. I think you would, normally, if you think about our fourth quarter, our Power Systems business usually has a stronger second half than they do first half. so I don\u2019t know anything this year that would cause that to be different and where we're ramping up production is mostly in Construction.","David M. Raso \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay. And lastly not to even suggesting and tell me 2014 sales guidance, but just going from what you've articulated in this press release and this discussion. You feel inventory won't be lowered further next year as a base case, right? So that's $3.5 billion of Cat sales growth next year, if retail is flat, I mean that's a caveat there. But when I think about your commentary and your thoughts around Construction and Power, can we walk away from this call saying base case, Cat is thinking revenue growth at a bare minimum is up next year?","Mike DeWalt","I would love to answer that question directly. But and I said about five times in my script, we're not doing an outlook. I think the message that we're trying to get people to think about is just the scale of the impact that dealer inventory reduction has had in this year. And the likelihood that, there is a lot of water to go under the bridge, and so I'm hesitating a little bit on making too much in the way of predictions about next year. Well, I think given the scale of what's happened this year, it's certainly not likely that that's going to happen again in terms of dealer inventory reduction. So\u2026","Douglas R. Oberhelman","David, Doug here. I\u2019ve kind of been waiting to make this point and this inventory swing up and down has been painful on us and our dealers. That is the fundamental reason we established our enterprise system, structure organization and emphasis a few months ago, working on lead times, lead manufacturing, and really getting after a condensed supply chain. And that's my number one initiative between now and the end of '15, and I think I said in the last call, we expect to see some of that in 2015. There is lots of mine, lots of fruit to be picked on this one. And if there is ever a reason or a good way to get after it, it\u2019s this inventory swing that we\u2019ve seen up and down. I just want to make sure you all understand how important that is if we get that organized. We have come a long way, but we still have the ways to go with that, and we\u2019ll start to see that manifest itself late next year and certainly into 2015 a little bit.","David M. Raso \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Okay. Thank you very much.","Mike DeWalt","With that, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re at the end of our hour here today.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. And we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Jennifer Driscoll. Ma\u2019am, the floor is yours.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Catherine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar second quarter earnings call. Joining us today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman of the Board and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, CFO; and Kyle Epley, Vice President of our Global Finance Services Division. We\u2019ve provided slides to accompany the presentation. You can find them along with our earnings news release in the Investors section of the caterpillar.com under Events & Presentations.","Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information discussed. For details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause actual results to vary materially from our projections, please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in today\u2019s news release. As indicated on last quarter's call, we're not reporting adjusted profit per share again this quarter, as restructuring costs are expected to be lower in 2019. It\u2019s our intention to report adjusted profit per share at the end of the first -- fourth quarter of 2019 to exclude any mark-to-market gain or loss for the re-measurement of pension and any other post-employment benefit plans, as well as any other discrete items.","As a reminder, our U.S. GAAP-based guidance for profit per share continues to include the benefit of the $0.31 discrete tax item we recognized in the first quarter. Please keep in mind that Caterpillar has copyrighted this call. We expressly prohibit use of any portion of the call without our written approval. Before I turn the call over to Jim, let me inform you about a change we're making due to investor preferences around the timing of earnings calls. Beginning next quarter, we plan to shift our earnings call to begin at 8:30 AM Eastern Time. This timing allows us to conclude our call before the U.S. stock market opens. Accordingly, we also plan to accelerate the news release timing to 6:30 AM Eastern Time beginning next quarter.","And, with that, I now turn the call over to Jim. ","Jim Umpleby","Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to slide 3 for our second quarter highlights. Sales and revenues this quarter rose 3%, to $14.4 billion. Operating profit rose 2% to $2.2 billion. Profit per share of $2.83 was slightly ahead of last year's record second quarter of $2.82. We delivered strong operating cash flow of $2 billion in the quarter. At our Investor Day in May, we announced our intention to return substantially all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividend growth and more consistent share repurchases.","As previously announced, we recently increased the quarterly dividend by 20% to $1.03 per share or $4.12 on an annualized basis. So far in 2019, we paid dividends of almost $1 billion. In addition, we repurchased about $1.4 billion in company stock this quarter, which brings the total to about $2.1 billion for the year. From a top line perspective, we experienced strong sales in the quarter.","Overall, demand remains positive. While some customers appear to be more cautious about making large capital expenditures, including in oil and gas, we continue to expect modest sales growth for the year. We are only two-and-a-half years into our recovery in many of our end markets. While we had strong top line sales, we experienced some unfavorable changes in mix and higher-than-expected restructuring charges. Andrew will discuss both of these items later in the call. Although, we are guiding you to the lower end of the profit per share range, we still expect 2019 profit per share to be higher than the record we set in 2018.","Now, let's review over 2019 expectations for the external environment on Slide 4. In Construction Industries, we expect -- we continue to expect North America will be a positive for us. This is due in part to infrastructure spending at the state and local level although we expect that to be partly offset by weakness in residential construction.","Turning to Asia-Pacific, we expect continued pressure from competitive pricing in China, partly offset by growth in other areas in Asia-Pacific. EAME is a mixed bag. Sales in Europe are projected to be steady, while Africa and the Middle East remain weak. Latin America continues to improve from very low levels.","We expect demand for heavy construction as well as quarry and aggregate equipment to remain strong in Resource Industries this year. Most commodity prices remain at investable levels. Mining equipment sales continue to improve and large mining truck sales have further room for growth to reach their normal replacement levels. We continue to anticipate that miners will remain disciplined in our capital expenditures in these early stages of their multiyear recovery.","The Energy & Transportation space is more mixed amid continued volatility in oil prices and tightened oil and gas capital spending. In reciprocating engines, we expect our sales into the Permian Basin will strengthen in the fourth quarter as takeaway capacity improves. We expect solar turbines to have a strong fourth quarter as well Progress Rail. Power generation continues to be an area of expected growth.","Please turn to Slide 5 for a progress update on our strategy for profitable growth. We continue to execute our strategy by investing in services and expanded offerings, while improving operational excellence. We've been working hard to improve product lead-times. Due to the significant increase in volume during the past two and a half years, we struggle to keep up with demand for some products. This was primarily due to ramp-up issues at our suppliers.","We're pleased that product lead-times have improved even though volume remain strong. We have achieved or are close to achieving target lead-times for the vast majority of our products. In Resource Industries, for example, our current scheduled average lead-time now is just 12 weeks, more than a 50% improvement compared to March of 2018 and we had a weighted average of 26 weeks for the entire portfolio. Shorter lead-times allow customers and dealers more flexibility on when to initiate orders.","We also continue to focus on enhancing operational excellence including safety. Our safety goal is always zero incidents. We want our people to return home safely every day. One of the metrics we track is the number of recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked. May and June were two of our best safety months on record. We intend to keep the momentum going and make it a great year for safety. Earlier this year, we announced a goal to double ME&T services sales to $28 billion by 2026. Services increased customer value by improving asset utilization and availability, while reducing owning and operating costs. We continue to invest to expand our digital capabilities enabling services growth and we remain on track toward our goal of one million connected assets by the end of the year.","Product rebuilds and reap hours are just one of our services helping customers to be more successful. Progress Rail recently won a contract to repower several locomotives for our U.K. rail customer. The new E&P engines will meet EU emission standards and the first three powers is expected to be delivered next year. Repowers and modernizations are both areas as our locomotive customers seek greater utilization of existing fleets.","Many of our meetings with mining customers these days include discussions around technologies like autonomy and automation and how they improve safety and productivity. We have recently been selected for three greenfield projects that will further grow our penetration of autonomy with mining customers in South America and Australia. More than 220 tracks have accumulated 50 million kilometers of autonomous driving in fleets already deployed. Our autonomous solutions are now being utilized by seven customers across 11 sites and three continents. We believe that we are at a tipping point for adoption of autonomy and mining.","For example, this quarter we announced that we will be working with Rio Tinto to create a technologically advanced iron ore mine in Western Australia. We will supply and support mining machines, automation and enterprise technology systems for this project. Working closely with WesTrac, our local dealer, Rio Tinto plans to create an automotive mine operation using data analytics and integration to enhance safety, optimize production, use mining machine utilization and lower costs.","We also continue to expand our offerings, enable us to continue to grow by addressing the diverse needs of our customers around the world. This year we introduced the first Cat-articulated truck GC model the 740 GC. As you may know the GC designation means the machine target segment that we refer to as life cycle value. This segment is for customers who have lighter duty applications or work in less extreme conditions. They value simple, tough machines that perform well with Caterpillar quality and product support. The 740 is particularly attractive in the North American rental market where it offers an additional value proposition in its size class. That said the machine is also gaining traction in every region of the world. Interest in the 740 GC has been strong with year-to-date demand exceeding our initial forecast.","With that, I will turn the call over to Andrew for a closer look at our financials.","Andrew Bonfield","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Starting with slide 6, I will begin with a closer look of results. Then I'll touch on backlog and dealer inventories before turning to our outlook for the second half and full year. Starting with the headlines. Sales and revenues for the quarter totaled $14.4 billion, up 3% from last year's quarter, driven by Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Overall operating profit increased by 2% or $46 million to $2.213 billion.","Second quarter profit per share was $2.83 was up by $0.01 versus the prior year's record second quarter. There were a number of factors, which impacted the overall performance of the quarter. First, negative mix had an unfavorable impact on profits. This has bolstered the product and the segment length of level. Second, oil and gas sales remained weak as we wait for the Permian takeaway issues to be resolved. We now expect this to occur in the fourth quarter. Finally we booked significant restructuring expenses in the quarter, which means that we expect this spend to be immaterial for the rest of the year.","We completed $1.4 billion in share repurchases in the second quarter and paid $492 million in dividends as part of our commitment to returning substantially all of our free cash flow to shareholders. We also announced a 20% increase in the dividend effective from the third quarter, which reflects our confidence in the company's ability to continue to grow cash flows. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity including $7.4 billion of cash on hand.","Let me dive deeper into the top line on slide 7. Consolidated sales growth was 3%, reflecting price realization in ME&T of 3% with gains in the three primary segments. Volumes grew by 2% and the demand environment remain strong. As we reported this morning, machine retail sales to users grew by 4% during the quarter.","Looking by segment, construction industry sales and revenues rose 5% led by price realization including the 2019 mid-year increase as well as the increase on the 1st of January. Sales and revenues from Resource Industries increased by 11% fueled by higher equipment demand and favorable price realization. Energy & Transportation sales and revenues declined by 4%, primarily due to continued softness in oil and gas as well as timing challenges and project in locomotive deliveries.","Our financial product segment revenue rose 5%. Currency pressures reflected the dollar strengthening principally against euro and Australian dollar. Overall, our top line growth reflected the customers and dealers confidence in the value proposition of our equipment. If you move to slide 8, I will walk through the changes in operating profit. As shown on the chart, price realization and low SG&A and R&D expenses closed the operating profit increase contributing $427 million and $118 million respectively. Financial Products also added $14 million to operating profits for the quarter.","Manufacturing cost increased by $328 million, due to higher material costs including $17 million in tariffs, variable rate on burden including the loss of Brazilian incentives and warranty expense. Unfavorable sales volumes about $190 million, primarily due to mix changes in both Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation. In Construction Industries, the mix of sales reflected an increase in smaller products in North America. The mix in ME&T reflects the changes in the application mix including smaller engines. Importantly, price realization more than covered higher manufacturing cost this quarter an improvement versus Q1. We also continue to expect price realization to fully cover higher manufacturing cost for the full year. It's now been a year since tariffs were implemented, and input prices are moderating. Freight costs have also stabilized. Currency lowered sales by two percentage points and reduced operating profit by about $20 million.","Moving down the P&L. Lower short-term incentive compensation expense impacted SG&A and R&D favorably, while also benefiting manufacturing costs. We expect 2019 short-term incentive compensation expense to be about $600 million lower than in 2018. Before taking a look at the segment results, I want to comment on how the second quarter trended against our first quarter performance.","Second quarter sales rose versus the first quarter driven by seasonal trends higher North American construction industry sales, sales of original equipment in Resource Industries, and higher rail service revenue. From an operating profit perspective, the second quarter was about flat compared to the first quarter.","The favorable sales performance was offset by negative mix and a negative operating leverage due to lower absorption cost into inventories driven by the reduction in production levels as we reduce Caterpillar inventories. The operating profit margin contracted by 110 basis points. From a segment perspective, the sequential margin deterioration was highest in Resource Industries which as you know had a very strong first quarter. The change in Resource Industries operating margin is due to unfavorable operating leverage from inventory changes coupled with higher warranty expenses.","To keep it in perspective Resource Industries in the first and second quarters had the highest profit margins since 2012, a year when sales were twice as high as they are now. Year-to-date restructuring charges are $158 million. We don't expect these to recur at these levels in the second half. We still expect the maximum of $200 million of restructuring expenses for the full year.","Now let's look at the performance of each segment in the second quarter versus the prior year beginning with Construction Industries on slide 9. Construction Industries had a record quarter for both sales and profit. Sales from revenues totaled $6.5 billion again a 5% versus the prior year. Construction sales increase in North America by $774 million due to demand changes including dealer inventories and price realization. Sales were flat in the Latin America where construction remained at low levels. Declines in Asia-Pacific reflected continued aggressive competitive pricing the timing of the selling season as well as unfavorable currency index. Weakness in EAME was primarily due to a weaker euro.","Construction industry's profit increased by $93 million or 8% to a record $1.247 billion, the segment profit margin of 19.3% increased by 60 basis points. The favorable impact of higher volume and price realization was mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs plus unfavorable mix. Now let's go to slide 10 and look at Resource Industries. Resource Industries sales were $2.8 billion up 11% from the second quarter of 2018. The $274 million sales uplift reflects increases in demand and favorable price realization. Sales growth in Resource Industries was driven by strong mining market nonresidential construction and quarry and aggregate customers.","Segment profit of $481 million rose 17%. Resource Industries profit margin improved to 17.2% up 90 basis points. The improvement was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Growth in original equipment remain strong as miners look to replace aging equipment. If you turn to slide 11, Energy & Transportation sales in the second quarter were $5.5 billion down 4%. Power generation sites increased by 3% on continued demand to large piece or reciprocating engines. The other applications were lower sales volume and unfavorable currency impact.","Of note sales into oil and gas applications decreased by $162 million or 11% due to the timing of turbine project deliveries in North America in last year's quarter, lower demand from new equipment in the Permian Basin -- which were partly offset by higher turbine sales and production applications in EAME. Industrial sales declined by 1% with gains in most regions, more than offset by currency-related impacts in the EAME. Transportation sales declined by 3%, primarily due to the timing of locomotive deliveries and reduced marine activity in North America, partially offset by higher sales trough rail services.","Segment profit for Energy & Transportation totaled $886 million, down $126 million, or 12%. The segment profit margin contracted by 150 basis points to 16.2%. Energy & Transportation margins reflected lower sales volume, including an unfavorable mix of products and slightly higher manufacturing cost, partially offset by price realization. Turning to slide 12. Let me touch on dealer inventories and backlog, which play into our assumptions for the year. Dealer machines and engine inventories increased by about $500 million during the second quarter compared with an increase of about $100 million during the second quarter of 2018.","The largest impact was in Construction Industries, where dealers decreased inventory in the prior year's period. We previously have projected that total dealer inventories would be about flat to the full year. Based on current inventory levels, we now expect that dealer inventories will increase for the full year by about $900 million, driven by Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Whilst dealer inventory levels are closer to the top end of our range, at this time we are comfortable that this level is supported by positive end-user demand.","At the end of the second quarter of 2019, the order backlog was $15 billion, about $1.9 billion lower than the first quarter of 2019 and down $2.7 billion from the balance at the end of the second quarter of 2018. The order backlog decreased across three -- all three primary segments with the largest declines in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. In Construction Industries, we connect the backlog to client to slowing orders due to growth in dealer inventory. Also, keep in mind, the Construction Industries had a record quarter and it's not unusual for backlog to decline in CI in the second quarter itself.","In Resource Industries, we improved throughput in factories and improved lead times, as Jim has described. And remember, orders do tend to lumpy. As a point of reference, the total decline in the backlog of $2.7 billion since Q2 last year is about offset by the increase in dealer inventories for the same time period.","Now let's walk through our assumptions for the 2019 outlook. We now expect profit per share to be near the low end of our range of $12.06 to $13.06, assuming a recovery in oil and gas near the end of the year and dealers working through part of the higher machine inventory levels. Quotation activities unchanged, the assumed price realization offsets manufacturing costs and as I've said, restructuring costs for the remainder of the year will be significantly lower with the maximum spend of $200 million.","Other key assumptions are broadly unchanged, including $250 million to $350 million in tariffs for the year. We expect short-term incentive compensation to be a tailwind of about $600 million. We now project capital expenditures of about $1.3 billion. The estimated annual tax rate is unchanged at 26%, excluding discrete tax items. Consistent with our intention to return substantially all free cash flow to shareholders, we are now projecting share repurchases in the second half to be similar to the first half. In fact including all shares repurchased since the 1st of January, 2019, we expect to reduce our total shares outstanding by about 9% by the end of 2019, all the while executing our strategy and investing for long-term profitable growth. This reduction in share count is fully reflected in our guidance.","Looking ahead to the third quarter we will continue to execute our strategy including making appropriate additional investments for longer term profitable growth. We anticipate stronger results in the fourth quarter including increases in demand from oil and gas and rail customers. So, finally, let's turn to Slide 13 and recap today's key takeaways. We grew sales 3%, operating profit rose 2%, profit per share was comparable with the second quarter of last year.","We have maintained our profit per share outlook, although we expect it to be at the lower end of the range of $12.06 to $13.06. Again this adjustment reflects mix changes, a fourth quarter recovery in oil and gas, and dealers working through higher machine inventory levels, partially offset by lower restructuring charges in the second half of the year. We still expect modest sales growth this year and profit growth on top of last year's record results. We are also on track including 2019 buybacks to retire a total about 9% of our shares outstanding by the 31st of December and our financial position remain strong.","With that, let me hand it back to Jennifer to begin the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Jennifer Driscoll","Catherine, thank you. If you could now queue up the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Rob Wertheimer from Millennium Capital. Sir, your line is live.","Rob Wertheimer","Thank you, and good morning, everyone.","Jennifer Driscoll","Good morning.","Jim Umpleby","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Wertheimer","So, thanks for the color on the dealer inventory. I think that will be something investors want to talk about. I wanted to ask for just a little bit more clarity around it. I mean obviously you don't control what the dealers do and it's their own decisions. But do you have a sense of what led to the change of the building a little bit of inventory through the year versus the prior expectation? It doesn't seem like sales have inflected up sharply since then.","And then just wrap my follow-up into it. I mean is the $900 million gap between what you thought and what sounds like it will be, is that the difference between your ideal level and where it may end versus the downtime risk for ongoing? Or maybe if you just characterize how big that gap is versus ideal? Thanks.","Jim Umpleby","Hey Rob, it's Jim, I'll take the first part of that question and maybe ask Andrew to do the second part. So, as you mentioned dealers are independent businesses and they control their own inventory levels. Inventory levels were lower than they normally are and with that increase, we're back up to what is considered more of a normal level.","I did talk about the fact that we had -- we have been successful in reducing our product lead times which also has an impact here as well. So, that gives dealers a lot more flexibility in terms of where they place orders. Andrew I'll let you have the second.","Andrew Bonfield","On the $900 million reduction, we expect for the remainder of the year, reduction to about $900 million. I mean we are slightly at the high end; we'd like to be in the middle of the range. We keep a range for each segment. We're always comfortable being at sort of midpoint in the range. This gets us around about the midpoint from our perspective, Rob. So there would be potentially further reduction, but we were very low in that range previously. And as Jim indicated they did have some impact on availability. Ultimately at the end of the day, we want to make sure that dealers have the right amount of inventory to be able to meet customer demand and probably there was given that the challenges we've had previously there may have been some loss of sales at dealer level as a result of not being under supply quickly enough.","Rob Wertheimer","Okay. I beg your pardon. So with the -- I guess reduction from here to the end of the year, you're saying you're going to be roughly in the middle of the range not certainly low of where you'd like to be? Is that what you're saying?","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah, that would characterize it. Yes, Rob.","Rob Wertheimer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is live.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the mix issues in the second quarter, how much that hurt earnings and what's implied for the back part of the year. And then just within oil and gas specifically I think before you said you had expected orders to pick up in the back part of the year in the second half now you're seeing the first -- fourth quarter. I guess just, sort of, what gives you confidence that you should see that acceleration? And how much cushion could we potentially get from solar in the fourth quarter? Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","Good morning Jamie, it's Jim. So our oil and gas guidance for the year is dependent on certainly solar having a strong fourth quarter. Solar has as you know the lead times are relatively long. They have the orders in hand to -- for the new equipment side to execute that. There's always some variability in service, but we are expecting a big fourth quarter from Solar and fully expect them to make that happen. We are also expecting in the fourth quarter some recovery in recip engine sales in North America as the Permian constraint issues continue to be resolved.","Andrew Bonfield","Jamie on the mix issues, obviously, the mix did have quite an impact in the quarter. If you look at we saw a small increase in volume, the sales level but a negative move in the operating profit level. Principally in CI that was mostly due to the fact that we also sold more small machines in the quarter while they have similar margins that can be quite sensitive to be able to mix impact.","And then, obviously, there's also a segmental mix and those mixed within E&T similar mix issue in E&T particularly with low smaller engines being sold. And then also there's a segmental mix impact, obviously, because E&T does have very strong margins and obviously the margin deterioration impacted the reported mix as we look at variable margin in that business.","All of those factors have been built into our guidance, so we have put that into why we expect to be at the low end of the range along with a delay particularly in oil and gas sales.","Jamie Cook","Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","Your next question is coming from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.","David Raso","Hi, good morning. I'm trying to think through the second half implied guidance. Just so we set the framework. It looks like you're implying revenues down say about $500 million first half to second half. But the EPS grows about $0.25 to $0.50. And I'm just trying to understand I can see about $0.15 from lower restructuring sequentially. It maybe about $0.05 from a lower share count so it's about $0.20. But then I would have figured rest would have been you see better price cost second half than first half, more than offsetting some overhead absorption issues with the lower volume. But I thought earlier you made a comment price cost maybe I missed it. So it's sort of neutral the rest of the year. Can you clarify that? Just trying to get the EPS walk first half to second half.","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah. Thanks, David. And \u2013 yeah, so first of all, we don't give sales guidance, so your assumption around sales maybe slightly different from our assumptions. So that may have been part of the impact that we're seeing. As Jim indicated, we do expect both rail and solar and oil and gas to pick up in the fourth quarter. All of those will have an impact and remember that obviously E&T is down for the first half of the year, when you look at that. So as you think about it from a top line perspective, there maybe some variability, we see versus where you are on your top line.","With regards to margins and operating margins obviously there are seasonal factors that come into play. As we did indicate, we're all starting to see a little bit of relief from pricing \u2013 from underlying manufacturing cost increases. Obviously, the tariffs we saw \u2013 start now anniversary-ing freight costs, started to pick up in the second quarter of last year. So those factors will have less of an impact on overall manufacturing cost. ","Offset against a little bit will be some variability, if we do actually take down some production. Obviously, we'll have a little bit lower inventory absorption. So those are all factors, which we weighed into our guidance. Then, obviously, we are starting to see some things like steel cost come down, steel obviously we do a lot of our steel buying on a contractual basis, and there is a lag, but we're all starting to see some of those things flow through as well into the second half.","David Raso","And then trying to set-up the look into 2020. We've already discussed the inventory but for the backlog. Seasonally, you can see how CI might continue to go down. But when you think about your commentary, the rest of the year on mining and engines E&T are we making the assumption into the backlog is somewhat bottoming out here, because RI and E&T offset CI sequentially? We're just trying to sort get a baseline kind of exiting the year. Have we seen generally speaking the bottom of the backlogs with this $15 billion?","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah. I mean, I think David one of the problems with focusing very much on the backlog is remind you that this is reflected about dealer demand. There would have been some elements of as a result of an ability to delays in supplying orders availability of product that dealers may actually have been putting slots in the queue and we have seen that happen before and that may have happened this time as well.","Obviously, what does happen with the order backlog is it is lumpy, particularly in places like RI, rail, solar. So we are keeping an eye on it. There's nothing indicating that from a retail, if you look at the retail stats just remind you they are up again. So there's nothing indicating underlying customer demand is changing. This maybe behavior by dealers and their ordering patterns as well.","Jim Umpleby","And, again, just to expand upon how you think about the lumpiness in Solar and Rail. Obviously, if you have a big fourth quarter, there is a lot of shipments that were in the backlog, obviously the backlog will go down. Again, that's \u2013 it happens every year that's the nature of the beast.","David Raso","Okay. I'm sorry, Jim. So a part of the $15 billion, you would argue is reflective of why you're confident in the fourth quarter shipments of those businesses, but at the same time it could help the backlog down from here there aren't new orders to fill it in so to speak? ","Jim Umpleby","Yes. And certainly and again that happens every year. So -- I say every year typically, Solar in particular has a big fourth quarter, so we would expect again shipments occur, backlog goes down. But again the business continues to be healthy and good quotation activity. So we would expect that there'll be a normal seasonal pattern in Solar in terms of backlog and inventory. ","David Raso","Terrific, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is live.","Ross Gilardi","Hey good morning, guys.","Jim Umpleby","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Gilardi","I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on the three new Greenfield sites for autonomous, you know the timing there. Are these retrofits or new trucks and equipment? And is that a positive driver into 2020? Or is it much further out? ","Jim Umpleby","Yes, it's a multiyear. We're going to make deliveries over a number of years and so they are new trucks. Again these are Greenfield sites. So again a lot of new technology, but the deliveries will occur not just in one year, it'll be over more than one year. ","Ross Gilardi","Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about your confidence in the China excavator outlook for the second half of 2019? I mean, it sounds like your full year outlook is broadly unchanged and as you\u2019ve cited there is some competitive pressure there. I mean, how much visibility do you have on that business for the rest of 2019?","Andrew Bonfield","Based on everything that we see, we believe that overall the market demand will be stable. We have mentioned the fact that we have some competitor pricing pressures from local competitors. We're certainly taking steps to ensure our competitiveness long term in China. We're introducing a number of new GC products that will help us compete as well. But again we are -- we feel good about our forecast there in China. ","Ross Gilardi","And then just lastly Andrew, you mentioned your share count should be down 9% by the end of this year with the buybacks. Beyond 2019, if you did 4 billion to 5 billion in buybacks, I think that will retire about 6% of the share count at today's price.","I was just wondering how much of that 6% is fair to assume for -- is offset by share issuance for employees options et-cetera. Just net of equity issuance, I'm just trying to get a better sense for how much the share count should be falling each year beyond this year?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So obviously the 9% -- around 9% is a net number. So that's niche of new issuance. So effectively given that we'd spend 3.8 last year, we expect somewhat to be in the sort of at least the 2.1 in the first quarter -- first half something similar in the second half. If you're doing about 4, you generally retire about 4.5% of the share capital each year.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. So share count just sort of this base case assumption at the current stock prices is probably falling 4% to 5% a year beyond 2019?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. Yes.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital. Your line is live.","Joel Tiss","Hey guys, how is it going?","Andrew Bonfield","Good. How are you?","Joel Tiss","So just -- it sounds like some pieces you're setting up 2020 to be a little bit more of a difficult year with the incentive comp down, so much this year and the dealer inventory is up a little more. Can you give us some of the pieces that to kind of balance that out? What would be on the other side of that? I'm not asking for forecast just kind of a couple of factors -- bigger factors to think about.","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. I mean let's remember that we have had quite a tough year in E&T so far. Obviously, Permian takeaway issues are resolved and drilling activity goes up that would be one area where we'd see some upside in 2020. I think if you look also at underlying demand for machines, it remains strong. So, again that's other opportunities for us as we move into 2020.","We will always retain our focus on a flexible and competitive cost structure. We want to invest in the right things for the business to drive long-term profitable growth but we still always do need to make sure that we are operating as efficiently as possible and those are other areas where we will continue to see some opportunity to drive growth as we move forward.","Joel Tiss","That's great. And then my second question is about something you mentioned there too. The cost reductions like it's you guys have done a lot a lot of work there. And it seems like the cost structure is seemingly not as responsive to the fluctuations like quarterly fluctuations in the business. Is that more structural? Or is it cyclical just your kind of scrambling to get stuff out the door? Or can you give us any color behind the scenes of what to think about? Or are those kind of more long-term changes to the company and we can't worry about the near-term results?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. I think we don't respond to quarterly -- by quarter movements we're trying to drive the business for the long-term. So, Joel as we look at the cost structure we do try to make sure we got a long-term focus on that and don't do things just for short term cost-cutting measures. We can all do those. We've all seen people do those. Longer term it's not what drives you well because what tends to happen is investment then gets cut off which isn't the right thing to do for long-term shareholder value creation.","Jim Umpleby","But I would say that Joe we certainly challenge all of our leaders to find ways to become more efficient to reduce cost. So, we still believe we have opportunities over next few years to continue to improve our cost structure. So, again, while -- as Andrew mentioned while continuing to invest in those areas particularly like services like our digital capabilities to drive long-term profitable growth.","Andrew Bonfield","And so Joel just add one thing on 2020 which I did forget was about Resource Industries. I mean obviously mining we are only in the start of recovery phase and replacement cycle. There is a lot of potential still but there is to run as miners start actually bumping up CapEx. All commodities remain at investable levels so we do expect that to continue to improve as we look out as well.","Joel Tiss","That's awesome. Thank you so much.","Jennifer Driscoll","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Jairam Nathan from Daiwa Capital. Your line is live.","Jairam Nathan","Hi thanks for taking my question. My question was regarding rail. You mentioned a strong 4Q, but you're seeing some of the implementation of PSR on the railroad side, they are cutting down a number of locomotives they use. And at the same time volumes are starting to decline as well rail volumes. So, I'm just wondering is this expectation of the U.S. or more international?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, it's really based overall on the backlog that we have in rail for new locomotives. But certainly I mentioned earlier the one example we gave of repower. As our rail business is a direct business and there's a large service element to it as well. So, it is not completely dependent upon new locomotives sales.","Having said that, of course, we are expanding internationally. We've shipped our first transit locomotives since we made the acquisition of EMD a number of years ago. So again we are not totally dependent upon new locomotives in North America. We certainly understand the environment, in which we're operating. But again what we're not talking about is an expected strong fourth quarter based on backlog on hand for the rail.","Jairam Nathan","Thanks. And my last question was on margins on resource, you mentioned warranty expense increased. Can you expand on that? Is that more volume related? Or is there something\u2026?","Andrew Bonfield","It was a particular issue with a particular product that happened, these things do happen they do tend to be lumpy and that's been a driver in this quarter.","Jairam Nathan","Okay, thank you. That\u2019s all I had.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Sameer Rathod from Macquarie Research. Your line is live.","Sameer Rathod","Thank you for taking my question. There are some -- have been some interesting developments made in electrifying the frack. So my question is how does Caterpillar see this market evolving? Do you think it can post a risk longer term to the diesel engine and parts business? Or do you think the applications are limited? Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","And I'm sorry, I can barely hear you. Did you say electrification and fracking? Is that the question?","Sameer Rathod","Yes. Electrification and fracking.","Jim Umpleby","You bet. So we have been very involved working with customers both on the recip engine side and on the gas turbine side and what people called the e-fracking opportunity. So we are well-positioned to participate in both of those areas.","We have sold some gas turbines, which are generator sets that allow customers to do e-fracking. We're also working on recip solutions as well, working with customers. So I believe it will be a mix market with both and we'll see, which one is stronger in the end but we participate in both ways, both for electrification and now also both in our recip engines and with gas turbines. So we're well-positioned to play directly across the value chain.","Sameer Rathod","Okay. Thanks.","Jim Umpleby","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.","Jerry Revich","Yes hi, good morning.","Jim Umpleby","Good morning, Jerry.","Andrew Bonfield","Good morning.","Jerry Revich","You folks have sounded more positive tone on large mining truck order cadence than I think we've heard from you in a while. Can you just talk about what in your view has driven a slower replacement cycle in this recovery so far? Is it the autonomous decisions that have to be made? And can you just expand a bit more Andrew on your comments that there's a scope for move towards replacement as you think about moving pieces around2020? So it does sound like you expect order decisions to be made, obviously, in advance of 2020 for that to play out. So maybe I can get you to expand on that too?","Jim Umpleby","Hi, Jerry this is Jim. I'll take it. So we see strong quotation activity on a global basis for all commodities. So as we work directly with our customers and with our dealers there is increasing quotation activity. There's a lot of projects that are being developed. We've talked about some orders that we received. Certainly I believe and I actually hope there\u2019ll be less volatility than will be -- that there has been in the past it will be more of a slow steady ramp up. But the quotation activity is quite strong. And again it's across all commodities.","Jerry Revich","Okay.","Andrew Bonfield","And just to add, I mean the pulp feed is at an all-time low since we've been tracking that number in 2013. So, it is an opportunity. Definitely, we do believe that now we will be starting to see replacements solvency come through.","Jim Umpleby","And we do expect our mining customers to be disciplined in their capital expenditures. So, again, that ties into my earlier comment about more of a slow steady increase than a volatile increase. And they will be again cautious and disciplined. But we expect the business to continue to improve on a slow and steady basis.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And in Construction Industries, you folks have worked really hard to get the cost structure to where it is today. Given the dealer inventory builds both across new equipment, used equipment and the utilization pressures, I guess, can you talk about what's the potential for you folks to more actively manage orders. You mentioned there are some slots that are potentially placeholders et cetera, so what's the opportunity for you folks to get ahead of the eventual order declines given what some of the leading indicators are doing, cut production earlier to keep the swings from being really painful on the manufacturing base.","Jim Umpleby","Yes. Just to be clear, so firstly, let me start with the -- we released our retail stats this morning. And so, business is improving. So let's start with that. But certainly shortened lead times is very important. We've been on this for lean journey for a long time and having shorter lead times allows us to respond much more quickly to changes in demand.","Jerry Revich","Andrew, the count was I guess more focus on North America than overall. So the retail sales were up 7%, the company sales were up 28%, so we're building inventories in North America specifically. So, I'm wondering what the potential to get on in front and cut production early in the cycle?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So we did -- so Jerry part of -- as we -- as I spoke in my comments, we did see some takedown of Caterpillar inventory, finished goods inventory, so we do continue to focus on that. Obviously with lean manufacturing, we are obviously -- we don't hold a lot of finished goods inventory. Most of the inventories held actually in the component levels are actually both in. So actually that is the one thing we continue to focus on. But obviously, we will look at making sure that we don't -- as we said, we will take down dealer inventory in the second half and then we'll have some impact on production base.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","You\u2019re welcome. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question is coming from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is live.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning. If I could turn back to oil and gas, I'd like to really understand your confidence in the fourth quarter pickup in sales. Is this products that dealers have ordered? So it's shipments to dealers? Or is it the rail end-market demand? And if you could just talk about your mix in oil and gas well completion versus drilling, so we know which one is more important to demand for your products. Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","Ann, so good morning. Again starting -- part of the oil and gas pickup as I mentioned earlier is due to Solar where we have the backlog and the orders on hand. It's a matter of executing always some variability in service, but we feel good about that. So that is part of it. If you go to the Recip side of it, gas compression remains strong. We are expecting an increase in end-user demand for fracking that will impact our business towards the end of the year.","Ann Duignan","And on the fracking side, is that actually drilling or is that well completions? I'm trying to understand if this one's right or if there's more.","Jim Umpleby","It's mostly well service.","Ann Duignan","Okay. Appreciate that. And then my follow-up question is more, if you look back at year-to-date performance, sales are up but in fact adjusted net income is down. So Jim, should we be growing concerns, should investors be growing concerned about your commitment to profitable growth? I mean, I know you can say you're at record levels, but net income is actually down and just the basis year-to-date.","Jim Umpleby","Yes. So we are so very committed to profitably growing our business and we're making investments to make that happen. And we are -- we talked about this at Investor Day as well that we do expect quarterly variability in our performance, but we are very much focused on improving year to year. We've talked in our call this morning about some of the issues we had in terms of lumpiness in restructuring charges and we had some inventory impact. We do have some mixed impact and we will have just given the nature of our business, we will have quarterly deviations in our performance. But we're really driving for is medium and long-term profitable growth and we're investing to make that happen. We're committed to take on -- to continue to improve our cost structure structurally. I talked about that earlier and we believe we have opportunities there over the next few years to take that on and we're very committed to that profitable growth story. But again, we will have quarterly deviations. There's no question.","Ann Duignan","And yes, but if I look at six of the last seven quarters your stock has underperformed. So, is there something you can do structurally going forward to help us understand this variability?","Jim Umpleby","Yes. Again, what we're driving towards is profitably growing our company. And if we profitably grow our company, I believe that will be reflected in the stock price. And we're going to have -- again as we talked earlier, we expect to have another record year in earnings per share this year. It\u2019s another record year.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Timothy Thein from Citigroup. Your line is live.","Timothy Thein","Thank you and good morning. The first question is on RI and specifically, Andrew, you had mentioned earlier that OE was a big driver or a driver for growth in the quarter. So, I'm not sure exactly what that means for part sales. But really the question relates to the sustainability of pricing which was up against some pretty tough comp again in the second quarter. And just, as you see basically the question is the trade-off on as your OE volumes presumably capture a bigger part of the total within mining, how should we expect that trade-off to play out in terms of pricing on OE relative to parts?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So obviously, we did have -- in the first quarter, actually, we had really strong quarter. I think it was a record quarter for part sales within Resource Industries and part of that was driven by the fact obviously, its rebuilds are still continuing. Yes, there will be a mixed impact. It depends on what equipment we\u2019re selling and the relative mix of parts versus and services versus OE. That will be part of why -- how we manage that business. Obviously, the advantage we have on OE is as you improve throughput, you do improve operating leverage.","And as I say, we actually have seen these two quarters, the first and the second quarter have been the two best quarters in our eyes since 2012 when actually sales revenues were nearly doubled what they are today. So I think we will see lumpiness, we will see movement that's the nature of that business particularly given the way we actually deliver our products to customers, but we're quite comfortable with the sort of the relative margin performance. And again, we will look at them over time rather than just purely quarter-to-quarter.","Timothy Thein","Okay. Got it. And then Jim maybe one last one on oil and gas, and specifically your comments to the question recently just on well servicing. A number of the big service companies have commented just in the past few days about cutting CapEx budgets some of them pretty significantly. So I'm just \u2013 I just want to come back in terms of kind of what's underlying that assumption that we do get this pickup of recovery in the fourth quarter.","Jim Umpleby","Yeah, again it's our perception of what's going to happen as the takeaway issue in the Permian are resolved. So I'll leave it there. ","Timothy Thein","All right. Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","And thank you. I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Your last question is coming from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.","Courtney Yakavonis","Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of clarifications. First on restructuring, can you just help us understand I think the first quarter you said was pretty minimal? So how much of that $158 million was hitting this quarter? And in which segments it was showing up? And then if you could also quantify the warranty charge that was in resources. And then just more broadly when we think about your China business with APAC sales down as much as they were this quarter in construction. How should we be thinking about the margin for that business as you're continuing to introduce these GC products relative to what you had been getting in light of all these competitive pricing pressures?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. Courtney, maybe start with restructuring. The charge in the first quarter was $48 million and the second quarter was $110 million. The $48 million is inactive, so you can now always refer back to that. Most of it actually was incurred and is held within the corporate item. There is some move back into the business but very limited and very small not materially impacting their reported margins. With regards to warranty expense, we don't actually break down the analysis and manufacturing cost, but the fact we\u2019re calling out to shows it was a significant item in the quarter. But obviously, and it did have an impact on the overall performance in RI in the comparison in Q1 versus Q2.","Courtney Yakavonis","China new products? ","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah, sorry. On China new products, obviously GC products are in lower price point, but had similar margins as we said before. So overall this shouldn't impact reported margins as much. Obviously, the most important thing is making sure we retain a good competitive position. This quarter was impacted in part \u2013 the reported revenues were impacted part by timing of the Chinese New Year. We did see the benefit of that in Q1, which did have a negative impact in Q2.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","And with that, we'll turn it back to Jim.","Jim Umpleby","Well, thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. Just a few closing comments. We view our competitive position is very strong. We're continuing to invest to achieve our strategy of a long-term profitable growth including doubling services sales in ME&T by 2026. We had \u2013 we expect record profits this year, our second consecutive record from an EPS perspective.","And as we talked about we continue to generate strong cash flow, which underpins our commitment to return substantially all free cash to shareholders through our buybacks and dividends. And as Andrew talked about if you take new account 2018 and 2019 by the end of the year, we expect to have a 9% share count reduction by the year -- by the end of the year.","With that, I, thank you, for your questions and we look forward to chatting with you next quarter. ","Jennifer Driscoll","Thank you, Jim and thanks everyone who joined us today. We appreciate your interest in Caterpillar. If you have any questions please reach out to me or Rob Rengel in IR and e-mail at driscoll_jennifer@cat.com or rengel_rob@cat.com. And now let me ask Catherine to conclude our call.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Mike DeWalt","Thank you and good morning and welcome everyone to our First Quarter earnings call. I\u2019m Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar\u2019s Corporate Controller. On the call today, I\u2019m pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.","This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you would like a copy of today\u2019s call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website, and it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","This morning we\u2019ll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1-A, that\u2019s Risk Factors, of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 19 of this year, and also in the forward-looking statements language contained in today\u2019s release. In addition, there\u2019s a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures and it can be found in our financial release which has also been posted on our caterpillar.com website.","Okay. Before we start this morning the Q&A, I\u2019ll begin by covering three topics. The first will be a summary of our first quarter results. Then I\u2019ll take a few minutes to discuss the outlook for 2013. And then the third topic will be our announcement this morning there will be repurchasing stock in the second quarter. So let\u2019s start with results. ","Without a doubt it was a challenging first quarter. When we started 2013 we expected it would a tough quarter and that\u2019s why we had a specific section in our year-end financial release that addressed the quarter. At that time we suggested that sales and revenues would be down more than $2 billion in the first quarter and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. Sales and revenues were $13.2 billion and that\u2019s a $2.8 billion or about a 17% decline from sales and revenues of $16 billion in the first quarter of 2012. ","Profit was a $1.31 a share, $1.06 lower than $2.37 per share from the first quarter of 2012. ","Now in terms of the sales, the majority of the year over year decline was a result of dealer inventory changes. Last year in the first quarter dealers bought more machines from Caterpillar than they sold and as a result, their new machine inventories rose about $875 million. In the first quarter of 2013 it was the reverse. Dealers bought less from us than they sold to their customers and their inventories of new machines declined about $700 million versus yearend 2012. In combination, the impact of the changes in dealer machine inventories was negative by almost $1.6 billion quarter over quarter.","In addition to dealer machine inventory, dealers also have engine inventories. And while the amount is much less then for machines and as a result we don\u2019t usually discuss it, there was negative impact in the quarter from dealer inventory changes for engines. When we started the year and in our year-end financial release, we expected dealer inventory changes would be a substantial negative in the quarter, and they were.","Now in addition to the dealer inventory impact, end-user demand was also lower for both machines and for power systems. Sales for aftermarket parts were also down versus first quarter 2012. Part sales were relatively high during the first half of last year, trended down during the second half of 2012 but started to move up now in the first quarter of 2013. For part sales though, compared with the first quarter of 2012, almost all of the decline we saw was in North America where coal mining has been down and we have had some tailing off of part sales for on-highway trucks. And we had two fewer work days than in the first quarter of 2012.","From a price realization perspective, overall the first quarter was about 1% for the company, that\u2019s about what we expected and consistent with our outlook for the full year. So that\u2019s a summary of sales. Let's turn to profit. The decline in profit was largely a result of the drop in sales plus $317 million of higher manufacturing cost, almost all of which was a result of cost absorption impacts related to lower production and inventory changes. Inventory, and by this I am talking about Caterpillar's inventory not dealer inventory, increased about $2 billion in the first quarter of 2012 and came down about $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2013, again that\u2019s compared with year-end.","A portion of our cost to goods sold is relatively fixed in the short-term and as a result significant changes in production and inventory does have an impact on profit. In this case it was negative year-over-year, roughly $300 million. Now on profit there were other pluses and minuses but sales volume and cost absorption were the main operating points in the quarter. The low operating profit also had a favorable tax item, but while favorable it wasn\u2019t a surprise. In our year-end financial release, we said we expected a favorable tax item related to changes in U.S. tax law that were enacted in January of 2013 while related to 2012. And in our January conference call we said it would be in the first quarter, it was, it was $87 million.","Okay, that\u2019s a quick review on sales and profit. Let me change gears for a moment and talk a little bit about China. Sales in China while not a significant portion of our total, have been a concern by many of you over the past year. There has been quite a bit of focus, in particular on construction equipment sales in China. And from an end user standpoint, our dealers reported deliveries in January and February that were below the same months in 2012. March on the other hand was better with dealer deliveries of construction equipment about the same as March of 2012. And while that\u2019s a move in the right direction and we are encouraged by it, it's probably still a little too soon to call it a trend that will continue. We will wait and see how the rest of the year shapes out.","On a more positive note though about China, our sales, this is Caterpillar sales not dealers sales, were up in the quarter. All in including machines, power systems and parts, we were higher than the first quarter of 2012. Inventory in China, and this is both Caterpillar inventory of finished machines and dealer machine inventory, has also been pretty topical over the past year. I am pleased to report this morning that we along with our dealers have made quite significant progress in lower inventory. Dealer machine inventories declined throughout 2012 and are currently at reasonable levels relatively to sales.","In terms of our inventory, that\u2019s Caterpillar finished inventory in China, as expected it declined during the first quarter. While inventory reduction is expected to continue into the second quarter, we do expect to begin increasing production in China during Q2. ","All right, that\u2019s a quick update on China. Two final points on the quarter, that\u2019s order backlog and cash flow. For the first time since the first quarter of 2012, our order backlog increased from the prior quarter end. At the end of the first quarter of 2013 our backlog was $20.4 billion, and that\u2019s up from about $20.2 billion at yearend 2012. The increase in power systems and construction backlog more than offset declines for Resource Industries which is mostly mining.","For cash flow, our machinery and power systems operating cash flow was about $900 million better than the first quarter of 2012 and that\u2019s despite lower profit. Cash flow improved despite lower profit and the changes in inventory had quite a lot to do with it.","We began reducing inventory in the fourth quarter of 2012, which came down about $2 billion. And it continued with another $0.5 billion reduction in the first quarter of 2013. We lowered production schedules. We\u2019ve had lowering plant shut downs in a number of facilities during the fourth quarter and continue that in many facilities in the first quarter of 2013. While we do anticipate some additional inventory reduction in 2013, we are expecting to increase production levels in the second quarter.","Okay, that\u2019s first quarter. Let\u2019s move on to the outlook. From an economic standpoint, our view of the world in 2013 hasn\u2019t really changed much. In our previous outlook and this is the one that we provided with our yearend financial release back in January, we were expecting world economic growth of about 2.5%, a small improvement from 2012. Our expectations for the year haven\u2019t changed much and we\u2019re still expecting world economic growth of about 2.5%. Again that\u2019s a little better than 2012, but from a historical standpoint pretty weak.","While our economic expectations haven\u2019t changed much, our outlook for sales and profits have come down. We now expect sales and revenues in a range of $57 billion to $61 billion with profit of about $7 a share at the middle of that sales and revenues range. Our previous outlook was sales and revenues in a range of $60 to $68 billion and profit in a range of $7 to $9 a share. Mining is the primary reason for the decline in the outlook","Previously, we had expected that after depressed order levels for mining during the second half of 2012, that we\u2019d begin to see some improvement as 2013 unfolded. Unfortunately, that hasn\u2019t happened. Overall, mining orders have remained depressed. As a result we\u2019ve significantly reduced our expectation for mining sales in 2013. We expect sales of traditional mining machines, now this would be a large trucks, large loaders, large bulldozers and the like in the aggregate to be down about 50% from 2012 and mining machines from our Bucyrus acquisition to be down about 15%.","Because the decline in the outlook is largely mining and that\u2019s generally more profitable than construction and power system, the impact on the outlook is not just sales volume, it\u2019s been also negative to product mix. However, cost flexibility and accountability are key elements of our strategy and we\u2019re aggressively reducing costs to mitigate the impact of lower sales. As a result, our profit outlook is $7 a share at the middle of the sales and revenues range.","In addition to cost reduction, we\u2019ve lowered our forecast for 2013 capital expenditures and now expect it to be less than $3 billion for the year. The lower spending on CapEx is a good lead in to the final discussion point today before we move to the Q&A portion of the call and that\u2019s cash deployment. ","Our priorities for cash deployment haven\u2019t changed. Our first priority is maintaining the strong balance sheet in our machinery and power systems debt per capita ratio in band from 30% to 45%. After that we fund growth, organic growth and acquisitions that set our business model. Next is appropriate funding of employee benefit plans, funding our dividend and increasing it over the business cycle, and when those cash needs are met, share repurchase. We announced this morning that we are repurchasing about $1 billion of Caterpillar stock. We believe it's an opportune time to do it. We have a strong balance sheet, cash flows improving, CapEx needs are lower, and we think the stock prices is effective.","So with that, let's move to the question-and-answer portion of the conference call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question today is from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","First question on mining and then second on share repurchase. You know on the mining side you are assuming, just your core mining down 50 and BUC only down 15%. And then I guess assuming a sort of down 50% mining this year, how do you put that into context versus short of normalized levels going forward, because obviously everyone is trying to figure what 2014 could potentially be. And then I guess, Doug, my question to you on sort of the change in thought process behind share repurchase, before that didn\u2019t seem like a focus for you and how do we think about normalized CapEx and then do you assume share repo in your guidance. Thanks.","Mike DeWalt","Jamie, I will start with the first part of that and I will let Doug do the second part. First part on mining, I just want to clarify, we are not looking for our total mining sales to be down 50%. Aftermarket is going to be certainly our outlook a lot closer to flat. Bucyrus piece of it is down about 15%. So in the aggregate it's not down 50%, it's just new machines. Big trucks, loaders, bulldozers and the like. In terms of what's normal, man, if I look back over the last few years in mining, it's a little tough to decide actually what's normal. I think this year is a year where our sales are certainly being impacted by dealer inventory reductions. Last year in addition to the end user demand dealers built some inventory in mining. So that\u2019s a factor certainly in 2013, as well as kind of the demand levels from customers.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","No, I know Mike, but just to clear I did phrase the question right. I understand that it was more new machines down 50% and I assumed aftermarket would be better, but why BUC only down 15%. You know what I mean, I would assume though...","Mike DeWalt","Well, I think if you look at the tradition of Cat machines, you do have \u00a0a dealer inventory impact that you don\u2019t really see with the Bucyrus machines. And I think the Bucyrus machines are more specific, I mean they are not --- they order them in smaller quantities and more specific to products individually that are maybe being retired in a mine. Historically, this has been the case. We saw this, when we looked to acquire Bucyrus we saw that even in the 2009 downturn the decline in that type of product was less then we saw in trucks and bulldozers and such.","And I do want to get back to one of the points that you made to, and that\u2019s on 2014. And I am sure we will, in the course of the next couple of months get a lot of questions about what does this mean for 2014. And that\u2019s a really hard question to answer at this juncture. I mean certainly we don\u2019t have an outlook for 2014 so we are not going to -- we are not going to go out with new assumptions about that or assumptions about that today. And what I would caution everybody that I think about just a little bit is, if we go back a year ago and we put ourselves in April of 2012, whatever predictions we made a year ago about 2013, the market has certainly changes since then. It may change between now and the end of the year, it may not. It's just too soon, I think, to make a call on 2014, other than just a couple of points that in fact we made this in our release today. ","Dealer inventory changes our impact of this year\u2019s sales. So the real end user demand level is not quite as bad as all our production and sales level. Once you get through that, it stops being a drag. Secondly, commodity demand overall has held up reasonably well and our machines are being used in the field. Most of what we sell is for replacements and at some point here that\u2019s going to have to perk back up. So sorry I can\u2019t be more specific on 2014. With regard to the second question on share buyback, I\u2019ll turn it over actually to Brad.","Bradley Halverson","That\u2019s a good question and the fact is our priorities as Mike just talked about have not changed. We think stock repurchase is an important way to reward shareholders and we\u2019ve done it in the past and that\u2019s been part of the things that we look at. So the question is why now. Our balance sheet is very strong. We think with the drop in stock price recently and where our P is, the fact that we believe we have a slow growing economy but one that\u2019s stable, if you look at our debt to cap in the mid-30s, we\u2019ve got enterprise cash of around $6 billion and a pretty strong net debt to cap. We had a good cash flow quarter. We have plans for a good cash flow year and we think again this is an opportunistic time here in the short term to reward our shareholders with $1 billion stock buyback.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","But Brad is there anything assumed in the guide?","Bradley Halverson","Say that again?","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","What do you assume in the guide level? Do you assume the $1 billion in share repurchase? Is that in the guidance or not?","Bradley Halverson","Yes it is.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","It is? Okay. ","Bradley Halverson","$0.06 to $0.07 a share, something like that. ","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks.","Douglas Oberhelman","I would just add a couple of quick notes on this, Jamie. Doug here. We have been intensely focused on investing in the company the last now four and a half, five years since the recession, but the thing that\u2019s probably been the overriding objective is to make our balance sheet rock solid impenetrable and the first quarter we saw is the fourth of last year, the inventory reduction really came through the levels that we were expecting that we wanted. The organization has responded to cost control. First quarter cash flow was outstanding. That all coupled with again a debt to equity rate -- debt to cap ratio of upper 30s and if you factor in the cash it\u2019s below 30. We contrast that back to the middle of \u201908 or this time in \u201908 we were much more fragile on the balance sheet. Coupled with as Brad said the multiple it\u2019s an attractive use of our cash right now and it\u2019s really that simple and I think it makes a lot of sense. Frankly should see the same about how we look at 2013 and the longer term because I know we have a lot of questions around mining and where is all that going. ","I still firmly believe long term and long term being the next generation of management and beyond and we\u2019ll view our moves into mining and what we have done the last few years as really changing our company for the better. We are used to cycles here, no question about it. Steve Wunning and that Resource Industries group right now is doing everything in their command to structure that business for the cycle. They have OPACC targets that they are exceeding and I\u2019m counting on there what the cycle we\u2019re going to let that business. It\u2019s just right now it\u2019s down from where it was and it will come back, particularly if worldwide growth as small as it is at 3% over time and growing construction industries around the world, they are going to require what comes out of the year. So we\u2019re definitely in a down cycle right now, but long term it\u2019s a great business for us. Probably more than you wanted to hear, but I wanted to drill that in Jamie.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","No, that\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies & Company","It\u2019s Jefferies. A couple of quick ones Mike just to follow up on your inventory comment. You said that inventory reduction would probably continue into the second quarter, just order of magnitude ether if you might have it. And I am curious if you could break that out between mining and the construction businesses. And then I have a quick follow up for Doug.","Mike DeWalt","Okay. Actually I am going to go slightly beyond what you just asked. Frequently, when we talk about inventory sometimes there is, if you are not careful you can get some confusion between company inventory and dealer inventories. So I really want to address both. From a dealer inventory standpoint, our projections have it coming down again in the second quarter. And historically, that didn\u2019t happen last year but historically that\u2019s the usual pattern. You know dealers normally build inventory in the first quarter and it comes down in the selling season when sales to end users are a lot higher in the second quarter. I think our view is that, that at least the selling down part of it in the second quarter in the selling season is likely to happen. I won't put an order of magnitude on it but I think to \u00a0a large degree it depends upon what happens to end user demand.","But it's probably more than a couple of $100 million otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it. So a reasonable decline. And I think probably in the second quarter, it will be split between mining and construction. It's a big selling season for construction plus we have this sort of march down of dealer inventory in mining that to some degree will probably occur throughout much of 2013. For Cat inventory, we do expect a little bit more decline for the year. You know we would not expect to do three more quarters of $0.5 billion a quarter. So over the course of the rest of the year we would see reduction but a little bit lower than the pace we had in the first quarter.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies & Company","Okay. Great. And then if I could, Doug, when we were out visiting in December, correct me if I put the wrong words in your mouth, but I think you had mentioned that you were willing to run with a little higher expense than you might otherwise, because you did believe that things were going to recover fairly soon and you didn\u2019t want to kind of cut in the muscle and not be able to take advantage of any upturn that might come. And I think you sort of said that you would re-evaluate that as we got through the spring. And I am curious now whether you think there is more you need to do on the cost side, whether you might change that view or whether you still think that that\u2019s the right stance here.","Douglas Oberhelman","Yeah, sure, Steve. And I would say the answer is split. In the case of construction we are seeing an uptick. We have been watching relatively flat but slightly increasing sales to users, for a number of months we saw that March. Saw it in the first quarter. You saw the backlog number. So we have been reluctant to go to the bone in construction and have not. Now we have got a number of restructurings occurring around the world in that but it's unrelated to volumes, it's related to structural costs. I am talking about Europe. In mining, yes, we are doing absolutely everything required to get that cost structure in line with where we are in the cycle and the Resource Industries mining guys, people have done a great job on that so far.","Where are we on all of that, hard to say but certainly the number of temporary layoffs we have, both in production and office staff around the world of the temporary nature. We have had a few announcements of something more permanent fairly on the miner\u2019s side. But basically we will go as far as we need to go to generate the OPAC targets we want and to deliver kind of the goals we have stated. So, so far it's a pretty mix bag of those, Steve. And I can give you a nice ambiguous answer because that\u2019s exactly the way we are operating -- Mining deep, construction industry is growing.","Bradley M. Halverson","Yeah, and I might add just some more comments, this is Brad. You know when we look at 2013 for the full year, we had strong confidence in our ability to execute. And if you look at the pull through kind of on a decremental rate for the year, it's around 25%. And it's around 25% despite the fact that we had two decent headwinds and that the mining mix in terms of where the sales are coming out, as well as the period cost absorbs the impact that Mike has talked about. So our plans, our trough plan is a flexible workforce. The things we\u2019re doing to control costs here have put less pressure on things like R&D and capital that would have been in the past. So we\u2019re comfortable with the year.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Joel Tiss. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","Bank of Montreal. Just two things. One, can you give us an idea by the end of 2013 how big mining is going to be as a percent of total company revenues and operating profits? Just so we can start to -- as mining shrinks faster than the company, it becomes less and less of a factor driving the whole company. So I just wanted to get a sense of where we are.","Mike DeWalt","I think as a percent it will be down a little bit from last year. I don\u2019t have a percent to give you Joel, but if you look at our results from last year, essentially almost all of the decline in year over year sales are out of mining or are at Resource Industries. Not quite 100%, but almost. So if you can calculate at least the sales numbers presuming that most all of the year over year decline is in resource. I think in terms of profit Resource Industries is still very good margin segment and as Brad said we\u2019re and Doug both, we\u2019re doing a lot of work on getting cost out of Resource Industries. So that would mitigate some of the impact of the decline from sales. Hope that helps some.","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","And then free cash flow expectation for all of 2013 roughly?","Mike DeWalt","We don\u2019t actually go out with a forecast of cash flow that we talk about externally. Suffice to say that inventory was a drag from last year. This year it should be a help. So that\u2019s quite a turnaround I think in cash flow from inventory being a contributor rather than a user. And then in terms of free cash flow our CapEx requirements likely to be down as well year over year $400 million, $500 million.","Bradley Halverson","Yeah. While we don\u2019t put out a number with where we are on inventory with our outlook on PPS, we\u2019ll have a substantially better picture of 2013 than 2012. I think we can say that and say we\u2019re pretty confident about it.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities.","Wells Fargo Securities. Just wanted to make sure I understood the broader implications of the guidance change, specifically the 13% reduction to earnings outlook after not much change in the sequential backlog or the global economic outlook. With respect to your mining views, clearly you made some changes, but what I wanted to ask was related to the customers. So do you suggest the current global capacity is sufficient to support their demand levels or do you think this is really a reset related to some of the management transition that\u2019s going on at your customers?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. Andrew, I think to some degree it\u2019s probably both. There have been quite a bit of management change with some of our big customers and I think it\u2019s clear they are the new management is much more focused on operating costs, short term cash flow. They\u2019re splitting their assets a bit and that\u2019s stacked up against the last few years where they were very focused on growth, a lot of new mine work. I think it\u2019s just probably both management and the fact that they\u2019ve actually bought quite a bit of equipment over the last couple of years. So I think it\u2019s both and I think if you look at our sales you also have to throw in dealer inventory. We actually produced more last year than customers bought. Customers will buy more this year than we\u2019ll produce. It\u2019s the opposite. ","So the swing between those two is an extra negative on us that our customers aren\u2019t seeing. You know if you look at our thinking around aftermarket for the full year, kind of part sales, that a decent proxy at least in our world for production levels with customers and how they are behaving. And our view that with the exception again of U.S. coal mining, that part sales in that mining kind of business will be pretty flat. So that says that customers are using the equipment that\u2019s out there and they are repairing the equipment that\u2019s out there. It's not a great economic climate but it's good enough to keep commodity production going.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities.","Okay, thanks Mike. And just one follow up on that. It's based on what you are seeing on the customer CapEx trends. Has this happened for a while or is this more similar to something we have got to go back 20-30 years to see?","Mike DeWalt","Well, I have not seen quite like this in my time, I don\u2019t know, and I am one of the oldest sitting around this table. And actually Doug is couple of years older than me. In my time I have not seen this. I mean the reduction in the purchase of new equipment is substantially more than certainly the decline in commodity consumption would suggest. So that\u2019s again making it pretty tough on those. We will be a point this year, you know if you look at our boost to the mining truck production as an example. We have taken the forecast down to a point where we are likely to be for large mining trucks only a couple of hundred about 2009, which was a terrible year for the world's economy. Big down year, financial crisis, kind of freeze up in a lot of markets. So it's pretty dramatic what we are seeing right now.","Douglas Oberhelman","I would answer that a little bit more broadly, and that is just addressing cycles. And I have been here longest in this room anyway and \u00a0I have seen cycles from Argentina to Alberta to the great crash of '09. And the one thing I guess if there is any silver lining in it since 2001 really is, this is the from ['97] probably the fourth or fifth major cycle for this company. And I would like to think as kind of negative and perverse as it is, we are getting pretty good at it. And while I don\u2019t like a three-year cycle, that is from '09 from '12 or '08 to '12, I guess, three-four years. If that\u2019s what we are living with, we are going to learn how to manage it. ","And the Resource Industries Group led by Steve Wunning and his crew right now are doing everything they know what to do, to size that for the cycle. And we will take that right on through any other of the businesses we have as well. And that\u2019s very hard on our people. It's very hard on our shareholders, it's hard on everybody. But if you look our performance through '09, so far I am very happy with where we are. Brad mentioned that pull through decrement in this case is kind of what we would expect on, that we have been enjoying on the upside. \u00a0And fortunately we are getting pretty good at these cycles and when it comes back we will even be, I think better at pulling that through on the other side of this. So that may be the perverse reality of what we are seeing here Andy.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Mike, you talked about backlog already. It did improve sequentially. You mentioned that this was really a result of construction and power systems offsetting Resource Industries. Do you think this was an inflection point in these businesses? And what's hard for us is we see, at least in the first quarter, construction and power systems were pretty weak. Some of that was inventory. And so, how do we look at those businesses versus the backlog increase offset by the weakness in the first quarter.","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, Andy, I don\u2019t know if it's an inflection point. I think that given what we have in our outlook for mining, I suspect that the backlog for mining will probably inch down. But what we saw in the first quarter was actually pretty strong order rates out of construction. Order rates for construction, for example, were better than the first quarter a year ago. Our production was down. Dealers were cutting inventory. We have a pretty decent build in construction backlog. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an inflection point. Our predictions around end user demand for construction as Doug said are stable to moderately better this year. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019re expecting a big increase year over year. We\u2019re just not seeing the kind of declines that you\u2019re seeing in mining. But all that said, it was a pretty strong quarter for orders outside of mining better than a year ago and that\u2019s a good thing. Hopefully it is signaling a trend. We\u2019ll see.","Douglas Oberhelman","Yeah. I would just throw in some maybe further clouding of the tea leaves to your question whether this is an inflection point or not. But many of you are aware and some of you were at Bauma last week in Munich, I was there for an extended period of time, some interesting statistics out of the Bauma show. Record attendance by a long shot, record exhibitors, record waiting list of exhibitors to come in and record machine sales by our dealer anyway inside Germany. You wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d hear that in Europe in this day and age. And so while all that was great news, off the chart news, there was other stories in Europe that led us to indicate that there is no end in sight in Europe either. But it\u2019s just a tough time to read the tea leaves and I\u2019d like to think this quarter or last quarter, this quarter whatever it might be an inflection point, but it\u2019s just too hard to say. We\u2019re taking it day to day. We like what we saw in the first quarter in terms of our backlog. We like what we see around the world with sales to users, but it\u2019s certainly not a boom.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, that is good to hear Doug. Mike, maybe if I could switch back to Resource Industries in the margin sense, decremental in the quarter were expectedly high. You talked about how you were going to mitigate that going forward. Can you talk about precise competition within the segment? Are you finding -- have you had to bundle equipment more against competition? Is there any discounting going on in mining right now? Maybe you can just talk about pricing within Resource Industries.","Mike DeWalt","I think whenever the subject of pricing comes up, whether it\u2019s Resource Industries or construction or impacts of the Yen at 100 or something close to 100, the reality the real world is it\u2019s not instantaneous. It doesn\u2019t usually change by a big amount. Our first quarter with Resource Industries, Power Systems, Construction, all of them were plus minus, pretty close to a 1% increase for the year. That\u2019s what we said four months ago for the outlook for the year. The first quarter was spot on our internal plan for pricing. So it\u2019s less than last year. If you look at Resource Industries last year, pricing was up a bit more than that for this year. It\u2019s definitely a positive territory, but not as big as last year. So I think -- I\u2019m not trying to suggest that low volume has no impact, but certainly in our business and probably for a lot of our competitors a lot of the pricing that we have are under  long term agreements that we have with customers. ","So during times when demand is really high and maybe otherwise you would go out and get more or at least have the ability to -- those long terms agreement are mitigate a little bit on the upside and mitigate a little bit on the downside. So pricing doesn\u2019t seem to be -- doesn\u2019t swing in big increments from plus to minus. In fact even in 2009 when sales dropped like 40% in total, price realization ended up being a positive for the year. And in this first quarter our sales and revenues down 17%, we\u2019re positive 1% on price about as we thought. So I think realistically it\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t competitive pressures. There are big competitive pressures all the time, but I think the net impact is probably less volatility than most people think.","Operator","Our next question today comes from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","David Raso - ISI Group","On the Resource Industries, the sales guidance for the year seems to be implied around down 20%. If I look at the first quarter revenues and just run that out flat sequentially, given the backlog is down sequentially, it's not necessarily a layup, but that would give me though revenues down for the year of 31%. So I am just trying to understand, what gets better sequentially in Resource Industries to get you back to full year down 20%. I guess maybe less inventory destock. I am just trying to square those two numbers off. What gets better sequentially in Resource Industries to get the full year to down 20%, not the 31% if it's just flat sequentially.","Mike DeWalt","David, we didn\u2019t give it down 20% for Resource Industries. I think kind of what we have been saying is, last year our total sales and revenues were about 65. It certainly is a midpoint of this year's outlook, we are looking out at -- the new outlook we are looking at 59. And essentially all that is, the down is the resource industry. So I think it will be more than 20%. I think if you look at the first quarter and then second, third, fourth quarter, kind of the movement through the year and what's likely to happen there, I think the negative impacts from dealer inventory build last year, kind of continued throughout the year but are actually positive for last year. Absence of and further declines this year on dealer inventory. We will probably start tailing off the fourth quarter, for example we didn\u2019t have the same kind of dealer inventory builds.","From just a production standpoint, from the orders we have received, orders on hand, kind of the production trend for the year, if you were to look inside of our production schedules we are not presuming any big upturn in orders rates. Our forecast doesn\u2019t need that. I mean it's not that we are forecasting no new orders, but it's very modest. So much of the year is in the order book already for big machines. So I guess in answer to your questions, dealer inventories impact plus the full year decline is probably more than the 20% you are thinking.","David Raso - ISI Group","That\u2019s an important distinction, Mike. Because obviously who want to own the stock want to, I want as much negative mining news baked already into the guidance. So just to be clear....","Mike DeWalt","Well, there is quite a bit baked in.","David Raso - ISI Group","I hear you, but if construction is up only 3% and power is flat, and others is going to be down with the logistics gone but also just say core down a little, it's not a big business. Resource industry needs to be down only 20% to hit your revenue number. If you are saying it's down larger than that, you are implying better from construction and power. Which given the mix the people are looking for, again, they want as negative Resource Industries in the guidance as possible. But to help us understand the math, because the math is, Mike, basically down 20% in Resource Industries, the full year number. Can you maybe give us a little more clarity on how you are thinking about construction industries and power systems on the revenue then?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, so I will go back. You know we have about $6 billion decline from actual 12 to midpoint of the guidance. That\u2019s $6 billion that is essentially out of Resource Industries which is mining. So I think that\u2019s more than 20%.","David Raso - ISI Group","So the bump up it sounds a little construction industries, power being down 12% for the quarter, getting the full year flat. Initially looked challenging but you did cite the backlog is up in power sequentially. Did I hear that correctly?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, and construction.","David Raso - ISI Group","And construction. And last quick one, the loss on that power project in the first quarter, can you quantify it for us so we have some better understanding of the underlying power systems margin for the quarter. And is that loss completed, done? It's in the first quarter and there is no lingering going forward?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. Well, we weren\u2019t specific to a customer. We certainly have confidentiality agreements with customers. But it was a big, a quite large project. It hasn\u2019t been delivered yet. It's our expectation that the first quarter contains whatever -- we don\u2019t expect any continuing losses as a result of that project throughout the year. So it\u2019s a loss in that context it\u2019s contained in the first quarter. I think in the scheme of our total results and probably in the scheme of the size of profit for power systems, it\u2019s not a big material item certainly for the company. But in the scheme of the profit change it was -- as we looked at all the changes, it rose to a level that we felt like we needed to mention it.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Steven Fisher. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Steven Fisher - UBS","It\u2019s UBS. Wondering how you're thinking about EPS ranges at the high end and low end of your sales guidance range. And if you can't give any kind of point estimates, I guess with the narrower sales range, should we assume that your EPS range is going to be narrower than $2.00 a share, or is the margin impact such that it could still be $2.00?","Mike DeWalt","No, I would say it\u2019s not likely to be that wide. If you think about our profit and Brad talked about our expectations for incremental and decremental margins, our order magnitude in and around 25%. Now in the first quarter it was worse than that because we had a sizeable impact from inventory absorption. I think if I were looking at our range, that\u2019s probably from an operating profit standpoint thinking about roughly speaking 25% ish up and down is probably a reasonable change or I mean kind of a reasonable assumption to do and that would give you a profit range less than $2 certainly.","Steven Fisher - UBS","Okay. And then you mentioned that order rates in Construction improved. Can you maybe just give a little more color on that by geography, and I guess by country, is what I'm thinking and then maybe within North America, is there any way to give some color on end market, be it highway versus housing versus commercial or anything else?","Mike DeWalt","I think it was actually fairly widespread, but I think the better way to think of it is order rates in the fourth quarter were quite low as dealers were trying to lower inventory. So they really drop order rates quite a bit in the fourth quarter really to get us to produce and ship less to them so they can take inventory down, which happened in the first quarter. During the first quarter the dealers raise order rates and I\u2019m going to say largely across the board because what they had already done to lower inventories for the most part has been played in. there will be more inventory reduction I think come in the second quarter in construction a bit. But order rates have moved back up to be certainly more in line. Remember too that the second quarter is a pretty high quarter seasonally for dealer delivery sales to end users. So they\u2019re already more pretty much across the board for that. If I could think of exceptions by country I would tell you, but I think for construction it was pretty widespread.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","It\u2019s Goldman Sachs. Doug, you've ramped up CapEx earlier in this cycle than what we've seen from CAT in the past. I'm wondering if you can talk about how we should think about CapEx beyond 2013 as we get past Tier 4 final and if you could touch on what type of projects you are trimming in the CapEx guidance this year, as that has implications throughout your CapEx, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Douglas Oberhelman","I\u2019d say we\u2019ll see how the cycle goes here, but I\u2019d like to -- we have seen, I don\u2019t know, 4 billionish. It's a high end, we are down now under 3 I guess for this year. That\u2019s going to cycle with where we are. The good news, and I would say for '13 and '14 and maybe into '15 is that the modernization we have done with our plants, the investment we have put in, the restructuring around the world, should get us through here for a couple of years regardless of whatever comes to us. And even minimal growth we are well poised for. We are concentrating on market share. If things pick up there, we can serve the market. So we are in really good shape when it comes to CapEx. But I would see it cycling up a bit if we see recovery kind of across the border in the next few years. Kind of in line with where we have been.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And Mike in power systems, can you flush out for us what you are seeing in the first quarter orders? It doesn\u2019t sound like you saw the order pressures that you saw in locomotives but maybe you can add some color there and touch on what you are seeing from bookings and electric power. Thank you very much.","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. Actually the industrial businesses improved some, so the order rates for industrial are up. Electric power has remained pretty weak. The oil and gas business has been kind of mixed. The drilling and fracing piece has been down, compression has been pretty good. Solar has actually a very good order book for the year. So I think if what you are trying to do is kind of gauge how the year is shaping up for electric power, I think we have -- we are probably most pessimistic on electric power, particularly the small end of that. Fairly neutral to positive on the oil and gas business and solar as well, the big end of that.","There is some sign that marine and industrial are starting to do a little bit better. And to your point, rail, actually overall in the first quarter was, certainly from the sales standpoint, fairly similar to \u00a0a year ago. They have a pretty decent order backlog in rail. You know that\u2019s \u00a0a business that we have done pretty well in. We have worked pretty hard on the cost structure, customers are buying more from us. I saw here just recently where GE is scaling back some production. So I think all in all, we have done pretty well in rail. So in the context of full year business that\u2019s relatively neutral in our outlook with 2012, you got industrial that\u2019s starting to look a little better. Marine, maybe a little bit better. Electric power, down. Oil and gas, back up.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","I was wondering if you could just circle back on the mining business again. The sequential increase in the parts business in the quarter, I mean you kind of touched on that U.S. coal is off, but can you tell us where that increase is coming from, where you are seeing some relative strength?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, I think coal is actually a good market to look at. If you look at coal versus the first quarter a year ago was down, but production has been edging up. It looks like utility output is up a bit. It looks like coal's percentage of utility production is up a bit. You have got record coal exports from the U.S. So while it's still a little bit below what was a year ago, coal production is kind of trending up a little bit and that has been, I think, a little bit of a positive certainly in the mining piece of it.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Any of the other commodities, any color there?","Mike DeWalt","On aftermarket, I don\u2019t know. I mean the numbers, once you get outside of the U.S., the overall parts numbers are plus or minus. They are not dramatically different. So it would be hard to get a read from it. I think if you look at commodity production generally, it's by and large up a little bit, not dramatically. So I'm just guessing here when I say this, but I would suspect outside the U.S. coal, there's probably not a lot of change.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. If we could switch over to the planned increase in production in China, I mean, could you give us a little bit more color what you're seeing there? Is Cat just outperforming the market? Do you feel like the industry is going to be more disciplined this time going forward? Or what gives you confidence to start raising production there on the Construction side?","Michael DeWalt","Yeah, I think there's two things. I think the fundamental one is that we've spent almost a year getting inventory down. So we've had production levels that are well below real end-user demand levels to work down inventory. Inventory is down to a point where -- not quite yet, but probably in the next month or so it'll be getting to a level where we're not looking to take it down more and so then the production will come back. So I think most of the increase in China production is because we're getting to the end of the inventory decline or hopefully anyway over the next quarter. But I think also mixed in there, certainly for the mid-size excavators in the marketplace, we're actually doing a little bit better than the market overall. So that's been a positive for us as well.

Ma'am, the floor is yours.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thank you very much, Kate. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to our First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Amy Campbell, Caterpillar's Director of Investor Relations. And on the call today, I'm pleased to have our CEO, Jim Umpleby; our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson; and our Vice President of Finance Services, Joe Creed.","Remember this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc., and any use, recording, or transmission of any portion of the call without the express written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited.

And then we will turn it back to Kate to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Jim?","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Think you, Amy. Before I talk about our quarterly results, I'll spend a few minutes talking about my perspective since becoming Caterpillar's CEO on January 1. It's a privilege to lead this iconic company and this strong leadership team, and I'm confident we are well-positioned for the future.","As you know, generally weak economic conditions and commodity price volatility have made the last few years challenging and have significantly impacted the industries we serve. We've responded to these challenges with a thoughtful approach to restructuring and strategies to improve our market competitiveness.","Our product quality has improved. We're continuing to invest in R&D and expanded our digital offerings to help our customers be more efficient and productive. We've made progress implementing lean manufacturing and have strengthened our dealer network, which provides us with an unrivaled competitive advantage. We are focused on controlling costs and maintaining the cost flexibility necessary to invest in products and services to drive future growth and shareholder value.","The goal of our entire leadership team is to return Caterpillar to profitable growth. Given the industries we serve, we will always be subject to cycles. But our goal \u2013 through focusing on profitable growth, a disciplined resource allocation methodology, and a more flexible and competitive cost structure \u2013 is to sustain profitability through the cycle.","Before I turn it over to Brad to talk about the quarter in detail, I'd like to congratulate our team on a great start to the year. Quarterly sales and revenues were up for the first time since 2015. The difficult but necessary decisions we've made since the downturn have resulted in outstanding operational performance. Profit per share, excluding restructuring, is twice what it was a year ago. There are encouraging signs and promising quotation activity in many of the markets we serve. And retail sales to users have turned positive for both Machines and Energy & Transportation for the first time in several years.","However, there is still a great deal of geopolitical and market uncertainty, along with economic volatility around the world that continues to present risks.","Now I'll turn it over to Brad to through walk through the results and the outlook in detail.","Bradley M. Halverson - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, good morning, and thanks, Jim. If you have the slide deck in front of you, I'd ask if you could please turn to page 4, slide 4, and we'll start with our first quarter results.","2017 has started off very well and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Sales and revenues increased about $400 million or about 4% on the first quarter of 2016 to $9.8 billion in the first quarter of this year. This is the first time in 10 quarters that sales and revenues were higher than the prior year, although sales are coming off a very low base. Resource Industries had the largest increase, followed by Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries.","In the quarter we announced our decision to close the Gosselies, Belgium, and Aurora, Illinois, facilities. Total restructuring costs were $752 million in the quarter, $591 million more than the first quarter of 2016. As a result, profit per share was down $0.14 from $0.46 to $0.32 in the first quarter 2017.","On a 4% increase in sales and revenues, profit per share excluding restructuring doubled from a year ago from $0.64 in the first quarter 2016 to $1.28 this quarter. The increase was driven by higher sales, favorable mix, improved price, and lower costs.","As you know we've been working hard on lowering our cost structure, right-sizing our footprint, and allocating resources directly to the highest profit opportunities. All these actions were key in delivering a very strong quarter.","Let's turn to slide 5, and we'll look at first quarter operating profit. First quarter operating profit was $417 million, as compared with $494 million in 2016. As I already mentioned, restructuring costs were up $591 million. Excluding restructuring costs, operating profit was up $514 million.","Positive changes to operating profit came from several areas. The largest increase to profit was the result of higher sales volume and favorable mix. About half of the sales volume profit change came from a favorable mix of products sold in the quarter. And that favorable mix impact was about equally spread across all three of our primary segments.","While the market remains very competitive from a pricing perspective, price realization was favorable $88 million, with more than all of the positive variance coming from Construction Industries, partially offset by negative price in Resource Industries. Variable manufacturing costs were favorable by $96 million, with about half of that positive variance coming from continued improvement in material cost.","We continue to reap the benefits of collaboration efforts between our dedicated procurement team, suppliers, and engineers, but we do not expect material costs to be \u2013 but we do expect material costs to be under pressure as the year proceeds due to an expectation of higher commodity prices, especially steel, in the back half of the year.","Lower period costs were better by $140 million. Lower period costs are a result of our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives that we have implemented over the last several years and delayed timing of R&D spend, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense of about $100 million. We also had strong ME&T operating cash flow, which was $1.5 billion in the quarter compared to $200 million in the first quarter of 2016. And we ended the quarter with $9.5 billion in cash.","Now let's look at each of the segments, starting on slide 6. Construction Industries' sales and revenues were up slightly to $4.1 billion. Positive price realization of $123 million drove more than all of the sales increase. While the construction industry market remains very competitive, especially in North America, favorable price realization was due to a particularly weak pricing environment in the first quarter of 2016 and previously announced price increases impacting the first quarter of 2017.","However, the sales story is more than just price. Very strong demand in Asia-Pacific was largely offset by lower sales volume in North America. The strong demand in China resulted in a reduction in Asia-Pacific dealer inventory, as demand outpaced our sales to dealers.","Strength in China has mainly been driven by a strong execution of public-private partnership projects, particularly related to infrastructure and strong housing investment. Credit growth has remained supportive and better than we previously expected. High replacement demand and a tight used machine inventory market have also helped. While March and April are traditionally the highest months for industry opportunity in China's peak selling season, if policy remains supportive we expect strong market conditions in China to continue at least through mid-year.","North America dealer inventory increased, but by less than a year ago. And end user demand was lower. Both contributed to the sales decline in North America. However, order activity in North America has been very strong, which has contributed to the increase in the backlog. The Middle East and Brazil remain weak.","Construction Industries' operating profit was favorable by about $200 million on about flat sales as a result of favorable price realization and lower cost. Construction Industries' multi-year focus on OPACC, as we call it, our operating profit after capital charge, delivered the strongest quarter for operating margin percent in a long time. And this on sales that are about 20% below the highs reached in the second quarter of 2011.","If we move to slide 7, we'll look at Resource Industries. We are very happy to report that we have good news in our Resource Industries segment. Sales were $1.7 billion or up 15% versus 2016, and operating profit was $158 million. After four years of declining sales, the part fleet has come down and is now under 20%. Hours of utilization on trucks is up. And for the fourth quarter in a row, parts sales have increased to support rebuild and maintenance needs. Sales increases for aftermarket parts were broad based, and they were the primary driver of the change in sales.","As you saw in the retail stats that were published yesterday, sales to users remain negative. However, after 16 quarters of underproducing retail demand, dealer inventory remained about flat in the quarter, with a positive change in inventory more than offsetting negative retail sales and driving Resource Industries OEM sales up. We are seeing sporadic order activity for mining equipment and expect to ship significantly more mining trucks than we did in 2016.","Resource Industries delivered positive operating profit for the first time since the second quarter of 2015, which is the result of significant actions that have been taken to lower their breakeven point. The improvement in operating profit resulted from higher sales volume and lower costs, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense.","Let's move to slide 8 and look at E&T. Energy & Transportation sales were up slightly in the quarter, from $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Higher sales into oil and gas applications, primarily in North America, were partially offset by lower Power Gen sales into EAME. Sales into industrial and transportation applications were about flat.","The number of oil and gas rigs in service continues to increase and has more than doubled the lows that were reached last May. This has resulted in an increase in aftermarket parts demand to support the overhaul and rebuild of well servicing fleets.","We are also seeing a significant increase in demand for our large reciprocating engines used for midstream gas compression applications. Demand for drilling and production application remains very low.","Operating profit for Energy & Transportation was up $142 million, from $410 million to $552 million. This was largely attributable to higher sales volume, a favorable impact from cost absorption, and improved material costs. Period costs were about flat as the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions was about offset by a higher short term incentive compensation expense.","I want to add a quick comment on financial products. Operating profit was up $15 million. The portfolio remains healthy and past dues were 2.64% versus 2.78% in the first quarter of 2016. Write-offs were down and used equipment prices are starting to recover.","Okay. Well, let's move to slide 9, and we'll look at our full-year outlook. We announced this morning that we are raising the outlook for full-year sales and revenues. In January we provided an outlook for sales and revenues of $36 billion to $39 billion. As a result of better-than-expected first quarter, strong order rates, and an increase in our backlog, we are providing new guidance for sales and revenues in a range of $38 billion to $41 billion with a midpoint of $39.5 billion, which is up $2 billion from our previous outlook.","At the midpoint of the sales and revenue range we have changed the profit-per-share outlook to $2.10, reflecting our decision to close the Gosselies and Aurora facilities. And we have raised the profit-per-share, excluding restructuring costs, outlook to $3.75.","We turn to the next. While there are positive signs across many of our end markets, and we have seen a significant increase in order activity and the backlog, we believe given the political uncertainty around the globe and the potential for volatility in commodity prices, that it is prudent at this point in the cycle and at this point in the year to consider both the positive and negative as we look at our end markets and what could impact sales as the year progresses.","There are several positive sentiments. World business confidence is at a two-year high and world growth is accelerating. There are also positive indicators for North America construction demand. Many states have passed infrastructure bills. Pipeline projects that were previously stuck in permitting are now moving ahead and residential and nonresidential demand in certain parts of the U.S. remains robust.","We believe business optimism, which may be contributing to elevated quoting and ordering activity in North America, is partially a reflection of the benefits of pro-business policy in regards to infrastructure and tax reform. However, we don't expect to see any meaningful impact from these changes until 2018.","The backlog is up $2.7 billion on strong order activity in all segments. China construction equipment industry is robust with industry sales up sharply versus last year. Gas compression demand for reciprocating engines is very strong. And miners' balance sheets are improving, and they are expecting increases to CapEx.","However, there are other risks to the outlook that we believe are prudent to take into account. Outside of Asia-Pacific, retail stats for construction industries remain negative. Demand for overhauls and rebuilds in mining and oil and gas could diminish as those units go back to work. Brazil remains weak. The Middle East continues to struggle as a result of lower oil prices. Competitively, the pricing environment remains very challenging. The potential for oversupply of oil could drive volatility in the price of that commodity. And geopolitical uncertainty across the globe is elevated.","If we go to slide 11, we'll look at it quickly by segment. We now expect Construction Industries sales for the year to be about flat to up 5%, driven largely by demand in China. We have yet to see retail stats in the rest of the world turn positive. While order rates are encouraging, they will need to be sustained by continued strength and business confidence.","For Resource Industries we now expect sales and revenues to be up 10% to 15% for the full year, driven by higher parts sales in the first half of the year to support rebuilds and maintenance work. And then transitioning in the second half to new equipment sales to support increased CapEx spending from the miners.","We now expect Energy & Transportation sales revenues to be about flat for the year. Improvements in oil and gas to support overhauls in maintenance for well servicing fleets and higher demand for reciprocating engines used in gas compression applications are largely being offset by slight weakness across Power Gen, industrial and transportation.","If we move to slide 12, we'll look at the outlook for profit. While there are several small puts and takes, the raise in the profit per share from $2.90 to $3.75, excluding restructuring, is primarily the result of an increase in sales volume of about $2 billion and a corresponding variable margin we would expect on higher sales, partially offset by an increase in short-term incentive compensation expense of about $200 million.","The outlook reflects just slightly more than half of the year's sales and revenues in the first half, which would be similar to trends in recent years.","We had a very strong quarter. And if you compare the first quarter to the average of the last three quarters, we expect some real headwinds, due to less favorable mix than we experienced in the first quarter, pressure on price and material costs, and the timing of period cost spend.","That said, at a midpoint of $39.5 billion in sales and revenues, and a PPS excluding restructuring cost outlook of $3.75 for the full year, at this sales range we would expect \u2013 we expect to deliver an operating profit pull-through of just less than 50%, well ahead of our target range of 25% to 30%.","So we'll wrap up on slide 13. First quarter was a great way to start the year, with higher sales and very strong operating performance across the board. We raised the outlook for sales and revenues to reflect a strong quarter and improved market conditions across many of our end markets. While uncertainty and the potential for volatility in commodity prices remain, we are ready to respond as demand increases.","We remain very focused on cost management. And we are using our operating and execution models to be very deliberate about where to invest so that we deliver the highest shareholder value, investments that include lean, R&D, and digital.","Before we turn it back to the operator for the Q&A portion, I believe Jim has a few additional comments.","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Brad. My first quarter as CEO has certainly been eventful. We had great first quarter results, announced the relocation of our headquarters to the Chicago area, the closure of our Gosselies, Belgium, facility and the relocation of manufacturing out of Aurora, Illinois. We've also ratified a new six-year contract with the UAW. Each of these are significant actions. Taken together, they will strengthen our company and create long-term value for our shareholders.","Also I want to provide an update related to the search warrant executed at three Peoria area facilities in March. At Caterpillar, we take very seriously our obligation to follow the law. And we are committed to maintaining our long tradition of pursuing the highest ethical standards in conducting our business. If we find something that violates our values and our code of conduct, we will take appropriate action.","At this time we have nothing more to report. Caterpillar has retained former U.S. Attorney General William Barr currently of counsel to the firm of Kirkland & Ellis to take a fresh look, get all the facts, and help bring these matters to proper resolutions. We are continuing to cooperate with the government investigation. Amy?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Jim. And now we will turn it back to Kate to open the phone lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today is coming from Joseph O\u00b4Dea. Your line is live.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. First question just on the guide and what you're looking at for margin in the rest of the year. I think you talked to a number of headwinds, but if you could just talk maybe a little bit more specifically about some of the details, whether or not price you see continuing as a tailwind? Or if you have visibility into that reversing to some headwinds? What you see on the mix front? And anything else with material costs that are on the horizon? Just so we get some comfort with the implied step down in the margins.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sure, Joe. And I think you have to look at it kind of two different ways. If you look at the new outlook that was provided this morning and compare it against the outlook from January, really broadly speaking the only two changes are those that Brad talked about, higher sales volume of about $2 billion, which will generate higher variable margin, offset by about $200 million more in short-term incentive compensation expense.","In the original outlook we communicated that we expected material costs to be favorable about 1% for the full year. While we expect that number to come down some, we still do expect some positive, maybe closer to zero, but still some positive material costs for the full year. Our outlook for price has not changed really very much at all since the original outlook. And our period costs assumption, excluding that short-term incentive compensation expense, is also, broadly speaking, about the same. So versus the outlook that we provided back in January, it's really just higher volume minus the higher incentive compensation expense.","If you look at what's changing from the first quarter to the rest of the year, there's a couple of things to keep in mind. We had very favorable mix in the first quarter. About half of the sales volume mix impact was from mix. And we don't expect to see that kind of favorable mix impact as we go forward. We do expect pressure on price and material costs in the back half of the year, especially around steel.","But even though we expect them to be favorable versus last year, we don't expect them to be as favorable as we saw in the first quarter. And there was some period costs.","Timing of spend, traditionally the first quarter is a low quarter for period cost spending, so some of our projects and initiatives that we have planned for the year did not pick up to their full spend rates in the first quarter. That would also increase as the year progresses.","But I think if you take it all in, and we're committed to incremental profit pull-throughs (26:08) for the full year, and the outlook reflects almost 50% operating profit pull through, well ahead of our 25% to 30% commitment and goal.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's really helpful. And then just one more on mining. And I think it looked like in the quarter actually, the benefit of some sell in to dealers that was better than what you saw in kind of the pull through demand. But you also commented on expecting significantly higher volumes I think in mining truck shipments this year. I believe you've talked about large mining truck shipment volumes in the kind of 70, 80 units last year. Can you give any kind of frame for exactly what kind of volumes you're anticipating in 2017?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. So if you look at Resource Industries dealer inventory, it really broadly stayed about flat quarter over quarter. And so since we've been on kind of 16 sequential quarters of taking dealer inventory down, that was a positive to sales. But dealer inventory did remain \u2013 it was actually up just slightly in the quarter.","As you mentioned, Joe, we probably sold about 70 to 80 trucks or so last year. It was probably closer to 70. We do expect shipments for large mining trucks to increase significantly. Most of those will be in the back half of the year. Several of those are going to large customers in less price-favorable regions, I guess you could say.","But we have good demand. I think even if we double the number of truck sales \u2013 and I think that's certainly very doable this year \u2013 it would still be the second lowest year for large mining truck sales. So we're still at very low levels, even in 2017, with what will probably be some pretty significant increases in our total shipments versus last year.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Your line is live.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning, and congrats on a nice quarter. Jim, not a bad way to start off as CEO.","I guess back to Resource, Amy or Brad, I'm just trying to understand what's implied in your guidance for research margins in 2017, given where we started the year at a 9.5% margin. I think that was better than what anyone would've hoped. Or did the margins get eaten away by selling to less profitable regions? I'm just trying to understand that. And then I guess \u2013 or was there anything unusual I guess in the first quarter that the 9.5% sort of isn't sustainable?","And then I guess the second question I have is just sort of how you're handling the cyclical upturn. When I talk to your dealers, a lot of them are complaining about lead times and that lead times are extended. So I'm wondering if when I think about your sales forecast, is any of the upside constrained by your inability to ramp? Or could you just talk about how you're thinking about ramping production in your supply base? Thanks.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sure, Jamie. If you look at Resource Industries margins, like I said we were very pleased with the margins that Resource Industries put up this quarter, $158 million in operating profit. If you kind of revert back to the fourth quarter call and Mike's discussion, we expected Resource Industries to lose a little money but be close to breakeven. And so it really had a great quarter.","We don't expect this quarter to repeat, either in terms of operating margin dollars or operating margin percent. But moving forward for the rest of the year we would expect Resource Industries to either break even or do a little better through the rest of the quarters remaining this year.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","But is there a particular reason for the step down? Like I understand you're saying it's not...","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So Resource Industries, as we talked about, that mix number was about equally spread across the three primary segments. We wouldn't expect that favorable mix to continue. There will also be, like in the other segments, some material cost pressure. And we do expect some sales for some mining equipment into some regions of the world that maybe aren't as price advantaged as other parts of the globe.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then just sort of lead times or how much your sales forecast is being constrained by you guys not be able to ramp quickly enough?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sure. I think there are probably two areas. Maybe I'll step back a little bit. If you look at Construction Industries, with a significant increase in orders for BCP [Building Construction Products] product in the fourth quarter and first quarter, several of those products have been moved to managed distribution. And with the announcement that we were considering the closure of both Gosselies and Aurora, we also put all medium wheel loaders on managed distribution at the beginning of the year.","In both cases that was to make sure that we got shipments to where they needed to go and to discourage some panic ordering or some unnecessary ordering to make sure we managed that. But we don't expect either of those actions to impact or drive a loss in sales situation.","If you look at China, I would say that for Construction Industries, while we continue to grow market share there and we're very pleased with how the year is shaping up so far, I'd say if demand continues at these levels (31:37), we're continuing to keep an eye on China and make sure that we can continue to meet the higher demand in that region.","But the other notable comment, and I've seen a lot of it being discussed out there, is for our large 3600 reciprocating engine. We have seen lead times for those extend out. And we're bringing the production back to our Lafayette, Indiana, facility. But we wouldn't expect that to result in any lost sales either.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Your line is live.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Hi. Good morning. Given your comments about the supply chain is not an issue at the moment, or loss of sales from any production ramp that you feel you can do, I'm just trying to reconcile really simply the sales guide. The rest of the year sales growth is implied at only 2%. But the backlog is up 13%, the implied orders are up twice as much as that. The revenues were already up 4% in the first quarter.","So can you just help us square \u2013 do you see something that would suggest growth has to slow from what you've been seeing of late? Because even if I just annualize the first quarter, for example, in CI or even RI, you're already at or above the high end of your range for those segments. So if you could just help us better understand the sales guide?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","David, if we go back and revisit some of the positive sentiments but also some of the negative, or risks that are out there in the outlook, we wanted to be thoughtful and mindful that there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world. And there's still the potential for volatility both in commodity prices and oil prices.","And so even (33:26) if you walk through a few of those, first of all we would expect \u2013 we're seeing a lot of demand for overhauls and rebuilds of both mining equipment and oil and gas well servicing fleets. We would expect that demand to taper off. Or I don't know if we would expect that, but it could taper off as the year goes on and all of those units get overhauled and repaired.","We also \u2013 we do need to watch the volatility. It's possible that too much supply comes back online in North America, which would drive some additional volatility in oil prices when it comes to commodity prices. While the demand and supply seems to be in better balance, there still is some persistently high inventories for several commodities, which could put some pressure on commodity prices.","If you look at North America order rates, as Brad mentioned and you mentioned, have been very strong. Certainly, there are some good fundamentals to support that that Brad talked through, pipeline. A lot of states have passed infrastructure bills.","But we believe some of that has to do with business optimism. And we need to see that business optimism continue through at least the second quarter I think before we get more comfortable and confident about what the back half of the year will look like.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Just to be clear, I mean those are all very valid and potential concerns. But these aren't things you're necessarily seeing in your current order books or trends. Is that correct? I mean all those points are valid.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","But I mean I'm just making sure nothing there sounded like we are seeing in the second half the rebuilds. Because if anything, the lead times are getting longer out of Lafayette. Right?","So I'm just trying to \u2013 some of the comments you made, I just want to make sure those aren't trends you're seeing in your orders. It's just \u2013 understandably it's April and things could change from a macro level. But from a micro level, are there any particular concerns? Because even the last nine months of last year, the dealers took out $1.9 billion of inventory. The year-over-year swing on inventory I assume the next nine months is a positive. Could you maybe help us with how you view dealer inventory the next nine months?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","So if you look at dealer inventory, and we didn't include that in the Q&A. I think it's really going to shape up to what we expect 2018 to be. And it's really too early to make a forecast for 2018.","Embedded in the outlook is a slight decrease in dealer inventory, certainly quite a bit less than what the $1.9 billion or $1.7 billion for the full year that we saw in 2016. I think back to your earlier question, we have seen I'd say the pace of order activity slow a little bit. But it is still doing better than a year ago as we said in April.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Okay. The reason I asked is the dealer inventory swing, if you even just get \u2013 you took out $1.9 billion the last nine months of last year. Say you take out only $650 million, that $1.25 billion of improved year-over-year dealer inventory, the rest of the year would give you almost 5% revenue growth. So it seems like your sales guide is not even a dealer inventory swing.","So that's why I was just trying to make sure I understand what's in it. And it just sounds like...","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","And completely fair, just a little more of a potential macro concern that could materialize.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Okay.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yes. I think if you looked at any one of those assumptions in isolation, I think you could conclude that there's some upside. And I think that makes sense and we would agree with that. But as we sit here in April, there still is a lot of uncertainty, there still is the volatility. We're only three months through the full year. We need to see order rates continue at the levels we saw in the first quarter in order to get more comfortable about the rest of the year. But we are I think very pleased with our ability to raise the outlook by $2 billion here one quarter into the year.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","No, that's fair. I appreciate it. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Your line is live.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Bradley M. Halverson - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. Just to take a step back. And again you're talking about products being on managed distribution. And yet at the same time we're looking at stubbornly high days on hand at Caterpillar of 123 days. Can you help us reconcile just why your own inventories remain so high? Is that just seasonal? Should we expect a significant improvement as we go through the year? Or are we going to see write-downs of inventories as we go forward? Just trying to reconcile that.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. So I think dealer inventory, we have taken production up at several of our facilities, a few that we talked about, Lafayette, Indiana as well as in China. We are having to build inventory in Gosselies and in Aurora and in our component plant across \u2013 in order to manage through the closure and consolidation of several of our facilities. So that is driving some dealer \u2013 or some dealer, excuse me \u2013 some of our inventory up here in the first quarter.","I think where inventory lands for the full year will have a lot to do with what 2018 looks like. We do at this point I would say expect CAT inventory to remain broadly about flat for the full year. Certainly continue \u2013 and both Brad and Jim mentioned this, continue to be focused on lean, driving an increase in inventory turns. Certainly have no expectations that there would be any write downs in inventory of any significance for the remainder of the year.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. And I do appreciate when you're closing large facilities, you have to build up inventory.","And then switching gears. I mean you mentioned a few times demand for reciprocating engines, strong in the oil and gas midstream. You didn't mention Solar at all on the turbine side. Can you talk about what's going on with Solar? And how the backlog looks there year to date and so far?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sure. So Solar, I think in the outlook \u2013 the original outlook from the last quarter, we shared that we expect Solar to be about flat 2017 versus 2016. That remains our expectation. We have a really good backlog to support the outlook for the year. The backlog for Solar was up slightly in the quarter as we continue to take orders moving out into 2018. And so I'd say Solar is kind of continuing as we expected on about flat sales for the year versus last year.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there and get back in line. Thank you.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Your line is live.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, Amy and gentlemen.","Bradley M. Halverson - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning, Steve.","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Morning.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Morning, Steve.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","I'm wondering, you gave a little bit of color, which was quite helpful, on sort of the trajectory of the Resource Industry margins as we go through the next three quarters. I'm wondering if you might be willing to do that with the other two segments? Because obviously margins in both of those other two segments also were I think higher than most people were looking for. So should we expect some deflation there as well? And if so, why?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say the reasons for the second through fourth quarter operating margin percentages to be lower on Resource Industries are pretty consistent across the other two primary segments as well. As Brad mentioned, Construction Industries had a great quarter for operating margin percent.","We would expect for the full year, which would weight in the first quarter operating margin for Construction Industries, to be just up slightly versus 2016 with pressure in the back half of the year from less favorable mix, pressure on price and material costs, and some period cost spend, timing that didn't occur in the first quarter.","For Energy & Transportation, which also had I'd say a very good quarter for operating margin percent versus a year ago, versus first quarter of 2016, I mean it's just slightly better than the full year for 2016, the first quarter of 2016 for Energy & Transportation. It was the lowest quarter by several hundred basis points versus the other three quarters in 2016. We would expect Energy & Transportation operating margin to be about flat for the full year versus 2016.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Would you be willing to sort of ballpark how much in terms of period costs that the first quarter was below normal?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, what I would say is for \u2013 as we revert back to the outlook that we provided in the fourth quarter 2016, we expected period costs to be about $450 million to $500 million. I think in the 10-K, we communicated $450 million lower for the year, excluding the higher short-term incentive comp and wage increases for the full year. And that assumption, with the exception of short-term incentive comp being up $200 million, hasn't changed with this outlook very significantly.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Adam Uhlman. Your line is live.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. It's Cleveland Research. I guess to start, the strong performance in the quarter seems to have been driven by part sales. And directionally, that should've helped the price realization I'm thinking as well. So I'm wondering if you could just dimension overall how much the parts business grew in total? And what your outlook is for the full year?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's certainly more complicated than that. Aftermarket parts were up. That primarily impacted Resource Energies (sic) [Resource Industries] and Energy & Transportation, as mining equipment was coming in and well servicing units were coming in for overhaul and rebuild. I think you have to take into account Construction Industries price was quite favorable as well. And Construction Industries didn't see really a significant increase in their aftermarket part sales.","So if we look at aftermarket part sales, we would expect that to be a little heavier in the first quarter and in the first half as that mining equipment and the oil \u2013 the well servicing fleets for oil and gas in North America kind of are coming in as we speak to be overhauled and repaired. But that work may decline as the year goes on and there's less units that need overhaul.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then secondly, could you speak to the restructuring savings that you expect to get out of Gosselies and Aurora? And the cadence of those savings? Are we capturing very much in 2017? And what should we expect for 2018 and beyond?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sure. I think we haven't changed the period cost guide for the full year in this new outlook. We wouldn't expect to see \u2013 I mean \u2013 sorry. Here, we wouldn't expect to see any cost improvements from the Aurora and Gosselies decisions in 2017. In fact, we would likely see some inefficiencies as we take production down in those plants in the back half of the year, which kind of is something that we're keeping an eye on.","The Aurora \u2013 the move and the relocation of production out of Aurora to the other two U.S. facilities, that work kind of wraps up in the 2018 timeframe. So we shouldn't see benefits for that until after 2018. And we do expect the Gosselies, Belgium, facility to start ramping down towards the end of this year. But we also wouldn't expect mature year benefits for Gosselies until 2019 and beyond as well.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","And how big are those savings?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","We're not disclosing those savings in particular. What I would say is they were included in our original September 2015 announcement \u2013 or they were being contemplated in a part of that broader commitment of $1.5 billion of total cost savings for restructuring. We delivered that through 2016. We expect about $500 million more \u2013 or $450 million more of period cost reduction from restructuring and cost reduction actions this year, which would bring us to about $2 billion in total. And it's really \u2013 we're not going to comment at this time on 2018.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steven Fisher. Your line is live.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just how did the increase in the aftermarket in Resource Industries play out in the quarter? Was the demand pickup from a broad swath of customers and a small part of their fleet, or a small number of customers and a large part of their fleet getting reinvestment? Or was it some combination of both? Just trying to understand the sustainability of that trend.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sure. I think if you look at the increase in aftermarket parts sales for Resource Industries, it was broad across all four regions. We're seeing good activity in iron ore and coal in Australia. Good activity for copper in Latin America. We are seeing a lot of machines get put back to work around coal in North America. And the CIS region is doing very well for gold mining. And there would be some other positive stories among those. But those are the ones on the top of my head.","So it is broad-based from a higher aftermarket parts perspective. And if you look at kind of order rates that were driving the increase in the backlog for Resource Industries, I'd also say that those are fairly broad-based as well.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just want to ask the revenue guidance question from the other direction. Because clearly there's been a lot of volatility in the stock price related to revenue guidance changes over the last couple of years. So just want to ask, what is giving the confidence to raise the revenue guidance by the $2 billion so early on in the year? And I know you mentioned obviously the backlog and quoting activity. And slide 10 had a lot of number of puts and takes there. But what would you say are giving you that confidence, the most amount of confidence? And what are the most important things that have to go right to at least hit that $2 billion before we talk about more upside?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. I think one thing I would say is you have to step back and look at the revenue increase versus 2016. So the sales and revenues increase is up just 3%. It's not a significant increase versus 2016.","And so while we certainly are pleased and excited that we're able to raise the outlook this morning, it's not a significant raise versus last year. So we still are remaining cautious. Certainly still many, many of our end markets are at very depressed levels.","I think from a perspective of what we need to see to \u2013 one, I would say, as you mentioned, and it's in the release, what gave us the confidence to raise the outlook was a very strong quarter, very strong order rate, and an increase in the backlog that should be fairly sustainable. What we continue to keep an eye on is business optimism in North America. And do we continue to see order rates stay at higher levels than we incurred in 2016?","We do want to watch the volatility of oil and other commodity prices. And there's still tremendous geopolitical uncertainty around the world that we're keeping our eye on. And want to make sure I think before we would take another step that we're comfortable about sustainability of the order rates versus what we saw in the first quarter.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Your line is live.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. A question on resources mining. Would you be able to characterize the increase in parts sales? Was it more big rebuild and sort of scheduled maintenance than people coming in and doing big projects? Or was it more a flow in consumables, maybe a restocking to dealers and restocking to mines, et cetera? Just a little bit curious on the mix on that.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. I don't have that breakdown, Rob. Kind of more it would just be anecdotally what I've heard the business teams share.","Certainly we believe that a lot of it has to do with overhaul and rebuild of mining equipment. We do believe that there may have been some restocking of dealer shelves in the first quarter. And certainly if you look at the hours of utilization of the mining equipment versus where it was at its depth, kind of middle of last year, mining equipment is being used quite a bit more extensively. And I think that you can conclude from that that it's driving consumables of filters and fluids and other things like that as well. So I think it's pretty broad-based across all three of those categories.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. And if I could ask a second. I mean Construction, CAT has spent a number of years sort of improving its competitive position relative to peers through limited pricing. And I think has successfully done that. I mean do you have any thoughts on what you think your sustainable margin is? Whether this quarter is starting to be more a reflection as you normalize your pricing versus competition what Construction can do? Or just thoughts on normal?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sure. As you could expect, I'm not going to give you a guide kind of on normal operating margin for Construction Industries. As I said a little earlier, we do expect a small improvement, a slight improvement in operating margins for the full year for Construction Industries versus a year ago. And that's going to be on significantly higher incentive compensation expense. So I think it continues to reflect the great work that that team has done and their focus around OPACC or operating profit after capital charge.","The pricing environment for Construction Industries, especially in North America, is very competitive right now. We are looking at that. I'd say it's across numerous competitors, not just with transaction pricing but also with financing deals. That's certainly a risk that we have in the back half of the year that we continue to keep our eye on and make sure that we're meeting our market position goals.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Your line is live.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning.","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Morning, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Question on the outlook. If I take the implied $3.75 midpoint, subtract the really good Q1 from that, it applies about a $0.30 earnings decline for the last three quarters of the year compared to last year. And then if I take the 50% pull-through expectation for this year, kind of implies flat Machines and E&T operating profit for the last three quarters. Could you help us understand the factors, if I'm doing the math right, below the operating profit line that are driving this $0.30 headwind?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. So there's a couple things. The tax rate is a little bit higher. I think it's about 28% now in the outlook versus 25% I believe for 2016. We do have a slightly higher assumption for shares. And then there are several things that happened in the other income and expense line, some hedging gains or losses that we don't put in the outlook as well as some income \u2013 or interest income, excuse me, and a couple other small things that are all occurring kind of below that operating profit line. That'll net you out to that reconciliation you're trying to do, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I'll follow up off line. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Your line is live.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning, Jerry.","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Morning.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm wondering if you folks can talk about \u2013 now that you're closer to completing the manufacturing footprint restructuring program, can you update us on your next set of strategic priorities? Jim, I appreciate it's only a quarter in. But I'm wondering if you could just outline for us the next areas that you folks are focusing on? And how you're thinking about the business over the next cycle?","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. And, Jerry, we have a group of senior executives that we pull together to really lay out our strategy moving forward. I mean call it a strategic planning committee. Something that Caterpillar CEOs typically do when they come into office. And so we're working our way through that. It's too early for us to talk about that. But certainly at the analyst meeting we're having later in the year, we'll lay those out.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. I guess on the shorter term front, you folks have rolled out the general contractor grade product lines across your developed market, construction equipment product lines. And I'm wondering if there are any other strategic priorities that are near term that you folks can talk about outside of what's planned for later this year?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","I think certainly \u2013 and there's certainly a lot of them. But one that comes quickly to mind, Jerry, would be our focus on digital, making sure that we have the best services and solution to meet our customers' needs and help them be successful and make more money using our products than our competitors'.","So all of the advancements, a lot of them on display at ConExpo, is a huge area of focus for us right now. We believe we have the largest industrial connected fleet in the world of about 0.5 billion connected assets. And we continue to expect to grow that this year. And so I think that's one area of many, as well as continued focus on new product development.","And then I'd say lastly, using the operating execution model to make sure we're very deliberate about where we put our resources to make sure they're being put around projects and investments that'll drive the highest shareholder value.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And, Amy, in Resources you spoke about a substantial production ramp for new equipment. I'm wondering if you can put that into context for us I guess. From some of your competitors, we're seeing book to bill, depending on the product line, but in the 1.5 range. And I'm wondering as you folks plan your production, are you folks maintaining or gaining share? Or are you down a little bit? Can you just give us some flavor relative to statistics we see from your primary competitors?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. And I think the number I gave was specifically around large mining trucks, which was one of the more depressed from its peak volume and off \u2013 and probably one of the most off of what we would consider kind of mid-cycle volume levels than some of our other mining equipment.","I think if you look at book to bill, we don't \u2013 as you know we don't disclose that information specifically. But I would say we don't believe that we're losing any market share. We are seeing very healthy order rates, good sporadic. I mean a year ago there was almost no ordering activity going on in Resource Industries. So we are coming off of a very low base. But we are seeing sporadic orders and good demand for mining equipment.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","And I think with that, well, that'll be the last question. So, Kate?","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

Ma'am, the floor is yours.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Caterpillar's fourth quarter earnings call. ","Joining us today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman of the Board and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, CFO; and Kyle Epley, Vice President of our Global Finance Services division; and Rob Rengel, Senior IR Manager.","Our call today expands on our earnings release which we issued earlier this morning. You'll find slides to accompany today's presentation along with the release in the Investors section of caterpillar.com, under Events & Presentations. For retail stats, look at our 8-K filed a few minutes after that.","As shown on slide 2, any forward-looking statements we make today are subject to risks and uncertainty. We also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we discuss today. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in today's news release for details on factors that individually or combined could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecasts.","Let me remind you that Caterpillar has copyrighted this call. We prohibit use of any portion of it without our prior written approval.","As previously indicated, today we're reporting adjusted profit per share in addition to our US GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share for the fourth quarter excludes our pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment for the remeasurement of pension and other postemployment benefit plans. The adjustment was $0.65 per share in the fourth quarter or $0.64 per share for the fiscal year. ","Our adjusted profit per share for the full year also excludes the $0.31 discrete tax items from the first quarter of 2019.","In the 2018 fiscal year, our adjusted profit per share excludes restructuring cost in addition to both tax related and pension OPEB mark-to-market adjustments.","our US GAAP-based guidance for 2020 profit per share includes estimated restructuring costs for the year and continues to exclude pension and OPEB mark-to-market impacts. ","Now, let's turn to slide three and turn the call over to Jim for his perspective on 2019 and our outlook for 2020.","James Umpleby ","Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Caterpillar's fourth-quarter earnings call. I plan to cover three topics this morning. First, I'll summarize our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results. I'll also provide an update on the progress of our enterprise strategy as well as some color on how the year ended versus our investor day targets. I'll finish with our expectations for 2020.","I'm pleased with the way your team is executing, notwithstanding the difficult economic environment which led to a decline in sales to users during the fourth quarter. I'll describe this segment later in the call, but just to give you a brief overview.","Sales to users for all three segments were lower than our expectations. In Resource Industries, we continue to see strong quoting activity in mining as most commodities remain at investable levels, but customers are being cautious due to global economic conditions.","While we experienced a decline in mining sales in the fourth quarter, we continue to believe there will be a gradual recovery in our sales to mining customers. Our mining sales are lumpy, so there can be significant variation between quarters.","Energy & Transportation was a mixed bag due to the diversity of our end markets. North American onshore oil and gas activity remained depressed as we expected. Both solar and rail had a solid fourth-quarter.","In Construction Industries, end user demand has softened, particularly in North America. As our earnings guidance indicates, we see some slowing across all three primary segments. We are ready to respond quickly to positive or negative developments in our end markets.","We're doing what we said we'd do at our Investor Day in May by achieving our financial targets, continuing to invest in services and expanded offerings, and returning cash more consistently to shareholders.","Sales and revenues for the fourth quarter declined 8%, which is our assumption of down mid-single digits.","Volume, primarily caused by changes in dealer inventory, drove a majority of the decline. Dealer inventory for the quarter decreased $700 million compared to an increase of $200 million in the prior year's quarter.","End user demand, which we released this morning, was also softer than we anticipated, down about 4% versus our assumption of flat end user demand for the quarter. Price realization and currency were unfavorable for the quarter as well. ","Our fourth-quarter operating profit decreased 2%, driven primarily by the lower volume. We increased our operating profit margin percent through disciplined cost control and stronger results from Financial Products.","For the fourth quarter, adjusted profit per share was $2.63 compared with $2.55 in 2018. ","Turning to slide four, sales and revenues for the full year declined about 2%, mainly driven by the movements in dealer inventory. Dealer inventory increased $800 million in 2019 versus an increase of $2.3 billion in 2018. End user demand increased about 2% for the year. The other two sales drivers \u2013 namely, favorable price realization and unfavorable currency \u2013 essentially offset each other.","For the full year, operating profit was flat on nearly $1 billion lower sales and revenues. The volume reduction was offset by strong cost control. Favorable price realization more than offset manufacturing cost increases.","Turning to profit per share, we ended 2019 at an adjusted profit per share of $11.06 compared with $11.22 for 2018.","Now, I'll summarize our 2019 results versus our Investor Day targets and the progress we made this past year executing our strategy, as shown on slide 5.","In operational excellence, we're pleased to report we achieved our best safety performance on record. We delivered a solid operating margin of 15.4% on $53.8 billion of sales and revenues. Our operating margin finished well within the target ranges we set at our investor day last May, which you may recall was an improvement of between 3 and 6 percentage points above the historical margins we delivered in the 2010 to 2016 period. Our free cash flow of $5.3 billion was also within our investor day target range.","We returned $6.2 billion or about 115% of our 2019 free cash flow to shareholders in dividend and share repurchases. That includes the 20% dividend increase we announced at investor day which reflected our confidence in the company's ability to deliver improved cash flows through the cycles and our intention to return substantially all free cash flow to shareholders. We reduced our quarterly average diluted shares outstanding by about 9% since the first quarter of 2018. ","Our services revenues increased 2% and were around $18 billion in 2019. We indicated during our Investor Day in May that our path to doubling services revenues to $28 billion from our 2016 baseline would not be linear and we continue to invest in services, including expanding our digital capabilities to meet this target by 2026.","Please turn to slide 6. At the center of our strategy is profitable growth. We made good progress this year on all three elements of the strategy \u2013 operational excellence, expanded offerings and services.","Beginning with operational excellence, as I mentioned earlier, we achieved our best safety performance on record. Yet one injury is one too many as we want all of our employees to go home safely every day.","We're proactively managing our production levels and our lead times are now at targeted levels for the majority of our products. This allows us to respond more quickly to both positive or negative changes in demand. Shorter lead times also allow our dealers to carry less inventory, which helps dampen the overall impact of economic cycles.","Turning to expanded offerings, one of our most successful areas in our GC line where we've launched six new models in 2019 or 11 new models to date. These new GC products, including excavators, articulated trucks, motor graders, wheel loaders and paving products, have broadened our product line to provide customers a full range of choices when determining the best machine for their various applications.","In Energy & Transportation, the team launched large generator sets that burn lean methane created as a byproduct of the mining process. The CAT G3516C uses methane that could otherwise be vented to the atmosphere, thereby reducing the mine's greenhouse gas emissions.","These engines are capable of burning relatively low concentrations of methane while reliably providing the engines full power at high efficiency. Customers appreciate the value of uncompromised engine performance over a wide range of gas quality.","Finally, we reached some significant milestones with autonomous solutions in 2019. We continue to believe we're at a tipping point for adoption of autonomy in mining.","In 2019, the number of mining trucks running CAT's autonomous solutions rose to 275, an increase of 48% over 2018. Our autonomous solutions are now working for seven customers across 11 sites on three continents.","Some customers have reported productivity benefits of up to 30% and have also reported positive enhancements to safety. Our customers are focusing on improving performance across their sites, so we've expanded our automated solutions to include a broader portfolio of trucks, drills, tractors and underground mining products.","We know many of you will be in Las Vegas at ConExpo in March and at MINExpo in September. We look forward to showcasing many of our new products and services at these exhibitions.","Services are a very important element of our strategy. In 2019, one of our primary goals was to improve parts availability to minimize customers' downtime. We are helping dealers better forecast customer demand through advanced analytics which enables them to improve parts availability. Services are a key differentiator for many of our businesses, particularly when we help customers avoid unplanned downtime.","In 2019, we achieved our target of connecting 1 million assets by year-end. Thanks to investments we've made during the past several years, we now have one of the largest fleets of connected assets in the industries we serve.","Connected products, such as CAT and non-CAT assets, provide rich data, including operating hours, location and product health, enabling customers to better manage and plan their maintenance. ","Having critical mass and connectivity enables us to work with customers in a very personalized way. Connecting assets also improves dealer capabilities, such as remote troubleshooting that can reduce technician time and provide increased customer uptime. We'll continue to connect new products coming out of our factories.","Turning to slide 7. Today, we established 2020 profit per share guidance of $8.50 to $10 compared with our 2019 adjusted profit per share of $11.06. Our planning assumptions for machinery, energy and transportation are that dealers will reduce their inventories by about $1 billion to $1.5 billion; that end user demand will decline by about 4% to 9% compared to 2019; and that services sales will grow modestly.","Global economic conditions are very fluid due to a variety of factors. We will continue to closely monitor our environment and will be ready to respond quickly to positive or negative changes in demand.","Our 2020 outlook includes normal restructuring as well as a $200 million placeholder for strategic restructuring actions. We plan to address a small number of products that are not delivering sufficient OPACC and to ensure we're allocating resources to those areas with the best opportunity for future profitable growth.","Meanwhile, we will continue to invest in services and expanded offerings to improve the value Caterpillar and our dealers provide to our customers. Andrew will provide more details on the outlook assumptions later in the call.","Our cash flow remained strong. During 2019, we paid dividends of $2.1 billion. As we said at our 2019 Investor Day, we expect to increase our dividend by at least the high-single digits percent during 2020, continuing our heritage as a dividend aristocrat.","We repurchased 4 billion of common stock in 2019. We expect continued strong cash flow in 2020 and share repurchases should be roughly similar to 2018 and 2019 levels. This is in line with our commitment to more consistently return substantially all free cash flow to shareholders.","Turning to slide 8. In 2020, we continued to execute our strategy for profitable growth. In the area of expanded offerings, we plan to roll out five additional GC models this year as we continue to invest in new products.","Within operational excellence, we are focused on improving our cost structure with a focus on back-office and procurement costs.","Finally, in services, we will continue to invest in our digital capabilities, so we can fully leverage our connected assets and are investing in other areas such as customer-focused designs.","Now, let me close by sharing our industry expectations for 2020 on slide 9. In Construction Industries, we expect slowing end user demand. In North America, while we expect stable spending on state and local infrastructure, residential and non-residential construction is expected to decline.","Turning to Asia-Pacific. We expect our sales in China to be flat to down 5%. We are actively monitoring the coronavirus for any potential impact. ","We expect EAME construction activity will be flat to slightly up, with growth in Europe slowing and Africa and the Middle East beginning to recover from low levels. The recovery in Latin America should continue, although from a low base, led by Brazil.","As a result of these conditions, we expect that dealers, particularly in North America, will further reduce their inventories.","For Resource Industries, we expect end user demand to be roughly flat. In non-residential construction, we anticipate lower 2020 end user demand. In mining, we expect mid-single digit growth for end user demand as quoting activity continues to be positive and commodity prices generally remain supportive of investment. Customers remain cautious and have more flexibility on order timing due to our improved lead times.","We continue to believe there will be a gradual recovery in sales to mining customers. We anticipate Resource Industries sales will be softer in the first half of 2020 with possible upside in the second half as mining confidence improves. ","As a result of these conditions, we expect dealers will further reduce their inventories. ","Turning to Energy & Transportation, we expect modestly lower overall demand. In oil and gas, we expect end user demand to weaken in North America for well servicing, recip gas compression and drilling. Oil price volatility and capital discipline by our customers are both contributing factors. ","Solar sales are expected to be flat to slightly up in 2020. Industrial demand is expected to decline modestly, mainly led by Europe. We expect power generation and transportation to grow modestly this year.","With that, I will turn the call over to Andrew for a closer look at our financials.","Andrew Bonfield ","Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 10 with total company results for the fourth quarter. I'll cover the segment results for both the quarter and the full year, then I'll walk you through our 2020 guidance and close with some comments on cash flow and capital deployment.","In total, sales and revenues for the fourth quarter declined by 8% to $13.1 billion. Operating profit decreased less than sales and was down 2% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted profit per share for the quarter increased by 3% to $2.63, mostly reflecting the benefit of the lower-than-expected tax rate.","Note that this year's adjusted profit per share results include restructuring expense, whilst last year's excludes it. Mark-to-market adjustments were similar in both periods, about $470 million in 2019 and about $500 million in 2018.","As you see on slide 11, sales decreased by $1.2 billion in the quarter. This result was below our expectation of a mid-single digit decrease in sales in the quarter. ","While price and currency was slightly unfavorable, the primary factor was a 7% decrease in volume. As we discussed in the third quarter, we expected dealers to reduce their inventories, partly due to our improved lead times which allow dealers to hold less inventory and partly due to uncertainty in the global economy, resulting from trade tensions and other factors.","This morning, we released the quarter's retail sales data, which showed a decrease in retail sales to users of 4%. We had anticipated the retail sales across all three primary segments will be flat, but Construction Industry sales to users declined by 3%, Resource Industries declined by 10% and Energy & Transportation sales to users declined by 3%. ","This weaker-than-expected end user demand and that whilst we cut back our shipments to dealers, dealer inventories came down by $200 million less than we expected or around $700 million in the quarter. This $700 million reduction in dealer inventory compares to a $200 million increase in dealer inventories in the fourth quarter of 2019. The movement in dealer inventories together with the reduction in end user demand explain the volume decline in the quarter.","Order backlog was weaker at the end of the year, down $900 million across the segments. I know many of you focus on backlog. However, I want to remind you that except for our direct businesses, mainly solar and rail, the backlog represents dealer demand. That means it takes into account dealers' view of what inventory they need to hold in addition to their expectations of end user demand. ","We view our retail sales data as a better indicator of demand over backlog. And whilst there is a lag, we believe retail sales data better represents underlying customer behavior. ","In addition to sales to users, we have other indicators of customer health. For example, we look at past use of CAT Financial which had actually improved in the quarter. That said, we saw a small uptick in repossessions of equipment in units and in dollars.","Auction prices and used prices are seeing downward pressure. These factors, plus the lower retail sales, gives us a very mixed picture. We will, therefore, stay prepared for an acceleration or deceleration in demand.","Moving to slide 12, operating profit for the fourth quarter fell by 2% to $1.85 billion. These figures are on a like-for-like basis as both years include restructuring expense..","Let me walk you through the changes in operating profit before discussing the changes in operating margin. Volume is the largest reason for the decline in operating profit. Price was also negative due to geographic mix and programs restarted to stimulate demand.","Favorable material and freight costs were offset by adverse warranty expenses which continue to impact us. As we said in October, we have some targeted product quality issues which we're continuing to address. ","Favorable short-term compensation expense and better cost control had a positive impact on operating profit in the fourth quarter. ","Finally, Financial Products had a strong quarter too. These tailwinds more than offset the negative impact from operating margin I mentioned a moment ago. This meant that the operating margin improved by 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter.","Now, let me discuss the individual segments results for the fourth quarter and full year. First on slide 13. Fourth quarter sales of Energy & Transportation declined by 5%, driven by weakness in oil and gas and lower intersegment sales, slowing demand for reciprocating engines in North America used for power gas compression applications, and lower turbine project deliveries contributed to an 11% decrease in oil and gas sales. We saw 5% increase in transportation as marine sales in the EAME improved. Power generation and industrial sales also improved slightly in the quarter. ","The segment's first quarter profit increased by 8%, driven by lower short-term incentive expense and lower manufacturing costs, which more than offset the impact of the volume decline. Segment operating margin improved by 240 basis points to 19.6%.","For the year, Energy & Transportation sales decreased by 3%, reflecting slower sales in oil and gas and lower intersegment sales. However, segment profit remained about flat in 2019 as the lower sales volume was offset by reduced short-term incentive expense. The segment margin improved to 17.7%, an increase of 40 basis points versus 2018.","Now turning to slide 14. For Construction Industries, sales decreased by 12% in fourth quarter due to lower volume. Dealers in North America and the EAME carried on adjusting their inventories. We continue to see Latin American sales increase of a low base, while Asia-Pacific Pacific remained about flat. ","Within Asia-Pacific, unfavorable price was mostly offset by higher volumes in a few countries. Sales in China rose in the fourth quarter, driven by dealers' desires to build inventory ahead of an earlier Chinese New Year.","The segment's fourth-quarter profit margin fell by 170 basis points to 13.1%. The volume decrease and lower price realization were partially offset by savings from material costs and short-term incentive expense. ","The unfavorable price realization reflected changes in geographic mix that we had anticipated, including reductions in dealer inventory in North America and some programs were put in place to stimulate end user demand.","On a full-year basis, Construction Industries declined by 3%. Margin expansion of 17.4%, a healthy level, yet a decrease of 60 basis points versus 2019. The decline was driven by the impacts of volume, manufacturing inefficiencies and an unfavorable mix of products, partially offset by favorable price realization.","Changing to slide 15. Resource Industries sales decreased by 14% in the fourth quarter due to reductions in dealer inventories and lower end user demand. Dealers' decreased inventories in the fourth quarter of this year after increasing their inventories in the same period of 2018. ","The inventory reductions taken in the fourth quarter were primary related to non-residential construction to better align end-to-end user demand. ","Turning to mining, we've seen continue disciplined CapEx spend by miners and have experienced longer delays between deal signings and the placement of orders. Lower volume was the primary driver of the 340 basis point decrease in the segment's profit margin to 10.9% for the quarter. ","For the full year, Resource Industries sales were about flat. Profit margin improved by 30 basis points to 15.9% as stable price realization offset the impact of increased manufacturing costs, including high warranty expense.","Moving to slide, we were pleased with the results from Financial Products, which increased its profitability by $181 million in the fourth quarter versus a challenging quarter a year ago. A lower allowance rate in 2019 was the main driver of the improvement. Past dues were down at the end of 2019 as well.","The Financial Product segment's profit rose by $327 million for the full year to $832 million.","Free cash flow for the quarter remained strong at $1.9 billion. We saw a significant reduction in our inventory levels in the fourth quarter as we reduce production levels in our plants. For the full year, free cash flow was $5.3 billion excluding the discretionary pension contribution made in the third quarter. ","Now, I'll talk about the outlook on slide 17. I will share the full-year outlook, a few key planning assumptions and some observations on phasing in 2020. ","We anticipate profit per share of $8.50 to $10 in 2020 compared with an adjusted $11.06 in 2019. The range reflects current uncertainty in the global economy, which is causing customers to delay or defer purchases of large capital goods. ","We no longer give sales guidance, but I'd like to share a few of our planning assumptions which we have used to derive our profit per share guidance for 2020. ","First, we're assuming lower end user demand of between 4% and 9%. We expect ME&T services revenues to increase modestly as we continue our journey towards $28 billion in 2026.","The full-year guidance we put together also assumes that pricing is about flat and that dealers will decrease our inventories by between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in 2020. ","Keep in mind that dealers are independent entities and control their own inventories. Given the slowdown in customer demand and the increased availability of product due to lower lead times, we do expect dealers will reduce their inventory levels further.","This reduction is expected to be led by Construction Industries, but will also impact Resource Industries. I'll talk a little bit more on how we expect dealer buying patterns to impact our phasing in 2020 in a moment. ","As Jim has said, we will make sure production is scaled to meet demand and we're ready to respond to signals from the market, positively or negatively. ","The top and bottom ends of the profit range roughly correspond to the top and bottom of the ranges for declines in sales to users and dealer inventories. ","We expect material costs to decline this year, including the impact of lower steel prices, procurement savings and lower freight. We also expect the increases in warranty costs to moderate in 2020.","We're committed to doing all we can to maintain a competitive and flexible cost structure and we're tightly controlling discretionary spending. As part of that, we're moving toward the outsourcing of some of our back office functions, which is expected to produce run rate savings beginning in the fall.","We're also working to improve our procurement processes as a way to reduce direct and indirect spending. These changes are not immediate as we realize benefits after new contracts begin and better prices flow through into inventory. ","Last year, restructuring expense was $236 million, slightly above our expectation. This year, we expect normalized level of restructuring expense. ","In addition, we're looking at taking strategic restructuring actions relating to certain products that are not realizing sufficient OPACC. We put a $200 million placeholder for that in our guide and we'll keep you updated through the year as we gain more certainty around the actual costs. Keep in mind that we also expect a headwind from normalized incentive compensation expense in 2020. ","We're committed to delivering our Investor Day targets of improving operating margins by between 3 percentage points and 6 percentage points throughout the cycle compared with our historical performance in 2010 to 2016.","We believe that our 2020 plan will enable us to deliver this, while at the same time continuing to invest in the greatest opportunities to drive long-term profitable growth. ","Based on the lower tax rate in 2019, we now expect the effective tax rate in 2020 to be around 25%. ","As you build your quarterly earnings models for 2020, I want to remind you of a few things that may impact our normal seasonable patterns. Overall, dealers increased their inventory by $1.8 billion in the first half of 2019. This occurred principally in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. ","We expect a modest increase in dealer inventory in Construction Industries in the first quarter ahead of the normal selling season. That will be worked down by the end of the first half.","In Resource Industries, dealer inventories rose in the first half of 2019, but we expect a modest reduction in the first half of 2020.","Energy & Transportation has a different seasonable pattern with sales and revenues in solar and rail being more backend loaded. We expect oil and gas sales to be impacted in the first half as we had a significant backlog of orders at the beginning of 2019, which is different from the current situation.","As a reminder, the reduced volume also impacts leverage, so that will be a factor in the first half of the year.","Moving on cash flow and capital structure on slide 18. Working capital improved in the fourth quarter as we reduce the levels of inventory held by the company. ","We expect working capital to be neutral to positive in 2020. The reductions in Caterpillar inventory, together with an expected lower payout of short-term incentive compensation, should help offset the lower operating profit.","Recall that the 2019 payout was against the results for 2018, which was a record year. We also do not anticipate any US pension contributions in 2020.","CapEx in 2019 was $1.1 billion. We expect CapEx in 2020 to be around $1.2 billion. ","Our commitment at the Investor Day was to improve our free cash flow by between $1 billion and $2 billion through the cycle versus our historical performance in 2010 to 2016. This, together with the strong cash position, which was $8.3 billion at year-end, has enabled us to increase the quarterly dividend by 20% this year and be in the market more consistently for share repurchases.","As Jim noted, we've returned $6.2 billion of cash to shareholders in 2019 through dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to returning substantially all of our free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles.","As we look ahead, we expect to increase the dividend by high-single digits in 2020 and the next three years after that. And based on our expected strong cash flow, to repurchase a similar level of shares in 2020 as we have done in 2018 and 2019.","So, finally, let's turn to slide 19 and recap today's key points. 2019 sales and revenues declined by 2% to $53.8 billion. Operating profit was down 2% and profit per share totaled $10.74 or $11.06 on an adjusted basis.","We've established a 2020 outlook range of $8.50 to $10 profit per share based on expectations for end user demand to decline between 4% and 9%.","Our top line modeling assumption reflects $1 billion to $1.5 billion dollars of lower revenue from dealers, further reducing their inventory levels. We're keeping a close eye on production, so we can respond quickly.","We're working on the competitiveness of our cost structure and our operating and execution models remains at the center of everything we do. ","We will continue to invest in services and expanded offerings. Our overall financial position remains strong and we expect strong cash flow in 2020 as well. ","We remain committed to our strategy of profitable growth and deployment of capital back to shareholders through a growing dividend and consistent share repurchases.","With that, I'll hand the call back to Jennifer.","Jennifer Driscoll ","Thank you, Andrew. We will now move to the Q&A portion of the call. In order to include questions from more of our covering analyst, we ask that you please limit yourself to a single question. If you have a follow-up question, we'd invite you to reenter the queue. Paul, please begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question is coming from Ann Duignan of JP Morgan Securities. Ann, your line is live.","Ann Duignan","Hi. Good morning, everybody. So many questions. I don't know how to pick one, but I think I will focus on pricing. If you could just expand on your flat pricing guidance for 2020, where are you seeing pricing improvement versus pricing degradation?","And then, you said you increased your marketing programs in Q4 to stimulate demand, but it doesn't look like it's happened. So, if you could just talk about pricing across the businesses and across the regions, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah. Ann, thank you. It's Andrew. So, couple of factors within Q4. As I mentioned, one, geographic mix was a factor as well. So, obviously, if you think about the way we price, particularly North America as a stronger pricing region, and so that geographic mix, given the reduction in inventory came through the price line. We expect that to continue as we do reduce dealer inventory through 2020. So, that will have an impact on pricing, particularly as you look at mix through the year. So, probably actually first half pricing will be a little bit weaker than we see, expect it for the for the second half. We have put modest price increases through. Obviously, we need to see how much of that sticks again and how much you have to put back into programs.","Yes, your point about, we didn't see much demand being stimulated, yes, because we did see a reduction in the sales to users in the fourth quarter. We believe that had we not actually put that pricing behind, they may have actually a little bit worse than that. So, that was part of the programs being put in place.","Ann Duignan","I'm sorry. Didn't fully understand your North America answer. You said pricing is stronger in North America or price reductions are greater in North America?","Andrew Bonfield","No. It's the geographic mix. So, as you go through, if you look what's in our pricing line, it includes changes in geographic mix. We base it on a rate per unit. And, obviously, North American units tend to have a higher price because they are higher stakes than prices across the rest of the world. So, therefore, you do tend to then see a negative price variance coming through as a result of that with lower new North American sales. ","Ann Duignan","And just so I'm clear, China pricing is down year-over-year. Is that the expectation going forward? And is it contained to China?","Andrew Bonfield","I don't think we've said anything about China pricing. We're talking about China sales. We said we expect China sales to be down flat to slightly down in 2020. We haven't talked about pricing by territory or market.","Ann Duignan","Okay. In the interest of time, I'll get back in queue, but I would like some clarification offline. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Joe O'Dea of Vertical Research Partners. Joe, your line is live.","Joe O'Dea","Good morning. I wanted to ask about retail sales. When we look at the trends, it looks like a rather sharp sequential slowing from 3Q into 4Q. And you commented that it was a bigger step down than you expected. But just in terms of how you interpret those trends and based on conversations you're having with customers and dealers, the degree to which you're able to parse out how much of that is a bit of a spend freeze at the end of the year, the degree to which you have any insight based on January versus you're noting kind of December demand levels as something that we should be extrapolating going forward?","James Umpleby","Good morning, Joe. So, really have to look at it by our various industry. There's no kind of one answer that covers all of those. We talked about the fact that, in mining, that business can be quite lumpy and that can be reflected in both our sales and our retail stats as well. Activity in mining continues to be strong. A lot a discussions with customers, lots of quotes, but our customers are being cautious, as we mentioned earlier. But we do expect that slow gradual increase to occur in mining and we're expecting a stronger six months than \u2013 last six months of the year be stronger than the first six. ","In oil and gas, we do anticipate the depressed market conditions in North American onshore production to continue in well servicing, recip gas compression and drilling. We do expect that to continue. ","CI is a bit of a mixed bag. Again, we talked about our expectations there for CI. I really don't have anything to add on top of that.","Joe O'Dea","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ross, your line is live.","Ross Gilardi","Yeah. Thanks, guys. Good morning.","Jennifer Driscoll","Good morning.","James Umpleby","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Gilardi","Jim, you know this oil and gas business that Caterpillar has a bit better than anybody. And I am just wondering how your spare parts and service for E&T, both upstream recips and turbines, how they are behaving? Were they stable in the fourth quarter? And are you expecting them to be stable within your outlook? Clearly, the new equipment outlook is very soft, but solar has traditionally been able to weather a lot of these downturns. And I'm wondering if you expect the parts and service components of your oil and gas business to remain resilient, particularly in an oversupplied natural gas market.","James Umpleby","Yeah. Starting with solar, as we indicated, solar had a solid fourth quarter both on the OE and on the service side. And we do expect their service sales going forward to remain resilient. That's been proved many, many times. So, we do expect that to be the case. We had mentioned a number of times over the last year, there's a bit of a pent-up demand for oil and gas parts for rebuilds that resulted in increased sales in 2017 and 2018. So, with the pressure on North American oil and gas, that business will remain challenged through 2020.","Ross Gilardi","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Jerry, your line is live.","Jerry Revich","Hi. Good morning, everyone. ","James Umpleby","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","I wonder if you could just expand on your decremental margin assumptions. It looks like you're embedding 35% decrementals give or take in the 2020 outlook. And when we look at your decremental in the last sales downturn, they were generally in the 20% range. So, I'm just wondering if you'd just bridge that as that could give yourselves room to execute in a challenging environment. But can you just share the pieces just to bridge us between the historical decremental margin performance versus the target for 2020?","Andrew Bonfield","Great question, Jerry. It's Andrew. Thank you very much. This is exactly why we don't talk about incrementals and decrementals anymore. What we have done, obviously, through the last downturn, the company took out a significant amount of structural costs. And as we've gone through the last couple of years where we've seen an upcycle, we have not put that cost back in the business. What that meant, obviously, is margins improve, absolute margins improve over time, which is why we gave the Investor Day targets of improving margins by 3% to 6% against historical performance. ","On the way down, because we are not \u2013 we haven't put a lot of structural costs back in, there's not a lot of structural cost to cut, so you will see, obviously, higher deleverage as you go down. ","Also, because we're expecting this relatively to be a pause rather than some fundamental change in the market, we are continuing to invest in both services and in R&D, particularly for NPI, new product introductions. That is important for us because that drives long-term growth. So, we maintain the flexibility. How we are managing it? We're managing against those margin targets. We look at the absolute margin to make sure we stay within that 3% to 6% range against the level of sales and revenues we're expecting next year and we do believe the plan we've got does do that. ","Jerry Revich","And, Andrew, can you just expand maybe a little bit on the variable cost structure part of that discussion because more variable cost structure would suggest lower incremental and decremental margin. So, I appreciate the comment on \u2013 we have less restructuring opportunities now, but maybe you can expand on that point because that would sound like it would reduce the cyclicality and operating leverage.","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah. So, obviously, volume is going to have a major impact next year as we go through. Obviously, that is the biggest single factor. And, obviously, operating leverage is a factor in the margin. ","With regards to the other part, obviously, we're expecting pricing to be about flat next year. We are expecting some favorability in material cost, as I mentioned, particularly around steel, and also because of some programs we've put in place. How much of that feeds through into margins next year will depend on how quickly we get those programs through out of inventory and actually into sales. We're also start expecting lower freight next year. Freight costs have been high for the last couple of years, and partly because of, obviously, trying to meet end user demand. But now with lead times being in a better place, we don't expect as much premium freight to occur.","Jerry Revich","Thank you.","James Umpleby","And maybe just to expand on that answer just a bit, one of the things that Andrew mentioned earlier is we're really paying a lot of attention to end user demand. Our dealers are independent businesses, but we're working with them to ensure that we don't have too much dealer inventory. And in the past, I'd argue that some of our cyclicality has been exacerbated by movements in dealer inventory. So, by shortening our lead times, having a dealer inventory that is appropriate for market demand, we believe that we will have a dampening effect on our cyclicality, which is part of what we're trying to accomplish. ","Jerry Revich","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets. Seth, your line is live.","Seth Weber","Hey. Good morning. ","James Umpleby","Good morning, Seth.","Seth Weber","I wanted to ask about the China construction market. I know you mentioned your expectations for the market to be kind of flat to down. CAT's been picking up share there recently over the last few months. Can you speak to your expectations for CAT, particularly what's been driving the market share gains? Have you sort of changed tact with some of your marketing programs? Is there new product that's kind of gaining good acceptance? And can you just talk broadly about your expectations relative to the market? Thanks.","James Umpleby","Yeah. What we indicated, I believe, is that we expect our sales to be flat to slightly down in 2020. We talked earlier about the fact that we're continually introducing new products as part of our expanded offering strategies. GC products and certainly a big part of that target customer audience is in China. We're continuing to build out our dealer network, continue to build out our footprint there, along with connected assets and all the other things we're doing. We believe that we're well-positioned to compete in China moving forward.","Seth Weber","Okay, sorry. So, CAT is flat to down. Is that better than what you're seeing for the market then? I thought that was a market commentary?","James Umpleby","I believe it's roughly similar.","Seth Weber","Roughly similar. Okay. Thank you very much.","James Umpleby","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from David Raso of Evercore ISI. David, your line is live.","David Raso","Hi. Thank you. My question is about EPS guidance, but can I go about it related to the dealer inventory swings. So, the inventory reduction this year you're targeting, midpoints, $1.25 billion, but the headwind for you is actually greater on a year-over-year basis, right, because the inventory went up $700 million last year. So, we're looking at a $1.95 billion drag year-over-year. But the way you spoke to the inventory sequentially, it appeared \u2013 and correct me if I'm wrong \u2013 almost all of that $1.95 billion, a very large majority of it, that year-over-year drag is really concentrated in the first half of the year, is that correct? ","Andrew Bonfield","David, it's Andrew. Yes, that is correct.","David Raso","So, when I think about the EPS cadence, pricing, a little bit of a struggle to start the year. The big inventory swing for the full year is really focused on the first half. Sort of set you up for the answer that I'm just trying to figure out then. Normally, the first quarter, the last, whatever, 20 years, the median, it's up a little bit from the fourth quarter. Your fourth quarter was on the high side. So, is it fair to say that's not the case this year? We start low in the first half. The first quarter is below the 4Q and then it climbs from there? I'm just trying to get, again, a sense of how much is the\u2026","Andrew Bonfield","Part of the reason why I tried to talk a little bit about the phasing for next year is, yes, do not expect the historic trends to prevail. As you know, normally, first quarter is a relatively strong quarter. Always a strong quarter from a margin perspective as we build inventory heading into selling season. And then, obviously, the second half is slightly weaker than the first half, but that is the normal pattern, both from a sales and revenue and also from a profitability perspective. ","Your assumptions you're making are fairly accurate based on what we're seeing. We do expect dealer inventory to have an impact on the first half. As I said, CI will see some build in Q1, but that should be broadly flat by Q2. RI will see a steady decline through the first half of the year versus a build last year. So, that is the likely outcome as we move. And so, yes, you can't just \u2013 you won't be able to just simply be able to use the seasonal trends as a plug in your model, I'm afraid.","David Raso","And just to be clear, Jim, last year, obviously, the inventory reduction was a little disappointing. The management's commitment to take care of this inventory in the first half of the year, I just want to be clear, I know they're independent dealers, but are we looking to take out year-over-year swing, completely avoid the normal seasonal build, you're not looking to build inventory at all in the first half of the year and that's that big year-over-year drag? I'm just making sure, from the prior, let's say, disappointments on the inventory the last couple of quarters, is there a firm commitment to address this in the first half and not let this linger into the back half?","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah. David, we work with our dealers, but they are managing their businesses themselves. So, we can't manage their inventory for them. However, based on our expectations on order patterns we're seeing from dealers, we do expect that they will be working hard to reduce their inventory in the first half of the year. We can't make a 100% commitment, but, obviously, we do expect the vast majority of that to happen in the first half.","James Umpleby","And one of the reasons that our fourth-quarter inventory didn't decline as much as we anticipated is because end user sales were lower than our expectations. So, obviously, end user sales has an impact on inventory in the quarter.","David Raso","I appreciate it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Ron, You may ask your question.","Rob Wertheimer","Thank you. Let's see if it works. Just a quick clarification. On North American construction, you have residential and non-residential construction to decline. Is that industry dollar spent on construction or is that construction equipment for the industry? ","And if I can, my question is really \u2013 the reduction in lead time is a fantastic thing for CAT and reduction in volatility would be a great thing for CAT. Any color around just the work you've done to achieve that and if dealers are starting to recognize that in wanting to hold structurally lower inventory? Thanks.","Andrew Bonfield","With regards to residential\/non-residential, construction equipment relating to that is what we're expecting to see the decline.","Rob Wertheimer","Perfect.","Andrew Bonfield","And then, as regards the inventory, let me hand that back to Jim.","James Umpleby","Yeah. In terms of lead times, we were working on this lean journey for a long time. And, obviously, if we can find ways to reduce our lead times, it helps us both in the up cycle to respond more quickly to increases in changes in demand and also allows us to cut back more quickly, so we don't have an overhang, which help to dampen the impact of the cycles. Again, we've got our total team focused on reducing cycle times, all part of that lean journey and really trying to synchronize across the value chain. And I think we're doing a better job of that than we have in the past. But it's a never-ending journey.","Rob Wertheimer","Okay. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Ashish Gupta from Stephens. Ashish, your line is live. ","Ashish Gupta","Great. Thanks so much. Just wondering if you could expand on your GC comments related to China. Maybe you can give us a sense of what went right or where you're looking for incremental improvement in 2020? I guess I'm just referring to sort of the market share losses through most of the year, although it did improve in the end. Just kind of trying to think about how much of a contributor that could be in 2020 and beyond, where the successes were and where you could see some incremental improvements?","James Umpleby","Yeah. Whether it's China or any other part of the world, the competitive landscape is continually changing as we introduce new products, our competitors introduce new products. So, that's nothing new. And so, again, you look anywhere in the world over time, we see changes in the competitive situation. We have demonstrated our ability to successfully compete in China. We've localized \u2013 we have a local leadership team. We have dozens of factories. We have localized our supply chain and we continue to build out our dealer network and increase services and connectivity and introduce new products. So, again, competitive situation in China or anywhere in the world is fluid, but we're very committed to be successful in that market and I believe it demonstrated we can be successful competitively.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse Securities. Jamie, your line is live.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. A clarification, if you could just elaborate. You talked about the normal restructuring of $200 million and then the \u2013 I'm sorry, normal restructuring which I assume is $200 million; and then the strategic stuff you're reviewing, another $200 million. I'm just trying to understand what's in the EPS guide that you're not adjusting out.","And then, I guess, my question is, you talked about reviewing products. You talked about some cost-cutting, realizing it's not what we had \u2013 there's not the opportunity in prior cycles. But as we get to the back half of the year, I'm just trying to understand are there any savings associated with these measures or does that play more into 2021? Thanks.","Andrew Bonfield","Okay. Jamie, so we have said we would \u2013 this year we expect \u2013 beginning of the year, we said that, for 2019, that we expect the restructuring cost now to normalize at between $100 million and $200 million a year. We were slightly above that. You will have heard me say that we were $236 million for 2019. We expect a normal level in 2020. So, between the $100 million to $200 million is the sort of normal level we would have. ","The $200 million, actually, yes, you're correct. It does relate to some products which are delivering OPACC. We've got to go through with doing the evaluation of the actions we can do. And at the moment, our guidance does not take into account that there would be any savings associated with these measures in 2020. We think more likely that will be in 2021 anyway.","Jamie Cook","And is there any way to think about savings associated with that or just too early? And to confirm, repurchase is in your EPS guide, right?","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah. Repurchases in the EPS guide. And, yes, we will keep you updated on this because, I think, as the charges come through, we'll pick it up and then we'll talk to you about what we're expecting from a benefit perspective.","James Umpleby","Jamie, to add in there, we're also continuing to look at ways to reduce our structural cost, particularly in the areas of back office, procurement and all the rest. And we do expect, again, over time, to have improved performance as a result of that. Again, relatively limited impact in 2020. But we're really trying to take the right steps in 2020 to set ourselves up for the future with a lower structural cost.","Jamie Cook","Thank you. That's helpful.","James Umpleby","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your final question is coming from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies & Company. Stephen, your line is live.","Stephen Volkmann","Great. Hi. Good morning, guys. ","James Umpleby","Hi, Steve.","Stephen Volkmann","Andrew, thank you for all the comments relative to sort of the EPS cadence. But I'm wondering, Jim, if I can ask how you're thinking about the markets. You talked about this earlier. I think you sort of characterized it as a pause. So, the down 4% to 9% in end user demand, is that sort of significantly lower in the first half? And then, maybe closer to breakeven in the second half? Or do you think this kind of runs its course and the fourth quarter run rate could actually be kind of back to growth again? Or are you just sort of predicting kind of steady continuous weakness in end user demand?","James Umpleby","I think you really have to look at it by segment. So, in Resource Industries, and mining in particular, we believe that the second half will be stronger than the first half. Again, we feel there is a slow gradual recovery occurring in mining. Our customers are cautious. But just based on the quoting activity and the amount of that that's going on, we do anticipate that there'll be a stronger last half of the year than first half.","In construction, don't anticipate any dramatic changes first half to second half. Oil and gas, onshore, we expect that to remain depressed throughout the year. Solar and rail typically have strong fourth quarters. It's that way almost every year. And we have no reason to think that wouldn't happen again.","Stephen Volkmann","Great. I appreciate. Thanks, guys.","James Umpleby","Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","Okay. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. ","James Umpleby","Thank you all for joining the call and appreciate your questions. CAT faced several challenges in 2019 and I'm very proud of our team of employees, how they met those challenges with determination. They've allowed us to meet our operating margin targets that we set on our Investor Day and do the other things we said we would do. ","And we continue to advance our strategy for profitable growth. We are investing significantly in services, expanded offerings and working on that operational excellence. Record safety year, shortening lead times, working on the cost structure.

Ma'am, the floor is yours.","Amy Campbell","Thank you, Kate. Good morning. And welcome everyone to our first quarter earnings call. On the call today, I am pleased to have our CEO, Jim Umpleby; our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson; and our Vice President of Financial Services, Joe Creed.","Remember, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Incorporated and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call, we'll be posting in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website.

A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the company's business in item 1A risk factors and the 2017 Form 10-K filed with the SEC, and also in our forward-looking statements included in today's financial release.","A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures be found in this morning's release and is also posted at caterpillar.com\/earnings. So we're going to start the call this morning with a few words from Jim, and then Brad will walk us through quarter results and our revised outlook, and then we will turn it back to Kate as we begin the Q&A portion of the call.","And with that I'll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Umpleby","Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank our global Caterpillar team for outstanding first quarter results. I am very proud of how our team capitalizes on improving market conditions to deliver a 31% increase in sales and revenues compared to the first quarter of 2017. Our team also achieved the highest first quarter profit in Caterpillar's 93 year history. We saw strength across many of our end markets in the first quarter including higher demand for construction and mining equipment and for onshore and North American oil and gas applications. We had a great start to the year. But higher sales volumes wasn't the only contributor to this record first quarter results. Operational excellence which includes safety, quality, lean principles and our commitment to control structural costs is one of the three key components of our enterprise strategy.","Our team kept manufacturing cost about flat in the first quarter of 2018 despite a 31% increase in sales volume over 2017 which represents excellent performance by our team. At Investor Day last September, we shared our target operating margin ranges for the company. And for each of business segments, at reasonable sales levels that we've achieved in the recent past. These target ranges represented significant improvement compared to those achieved the last time we experienced similar sales volumes. While operating margins are expected to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we are pleased that in the first quarter of 2018, construction industries and resource industries exceeded the targeted ranges communicated during Investor Day.","Energy and transportation operating margin in the first quarter was squarely within its targeted range as was the total Caterpillar enterprise. During the quarter, we made strategic investments and expanded our offerings and services to other two key components of our strategy. As we focus on delivering long-term profitable growth in serving our customers, we will continue to make targeted investments through the remainder of the year. Even with these additional targeted investments, we are raising our full year outlook by $2 per share along with strong first quarter results, economic indicators generally remain positive and our backlog has grown.","Before I turn it over to Brad, I'd like to say a few words about our refreshed cash deployment priorities. As you will see in the slide presentation, we made some changes in support of our enterprise strategy with some things like our commitment to maintain the dividend and a strong balance sheet haven't changed.","We will change how we approach funding growth and share repurchases. Our growth initiatives will be primarily in the strategic priorities of expanded offerings and services not in factor capacity. In the first quarter, we also repurchased $500 million of common stock. Moving forward, we intend to begin the market on a fairly consistent basis to offset the impact of share dilution overtime. We are off to a great start in 2018, but we also have lots of work to do. I am confident that our team will continue to execute our strategy as we move throughout the year.","With that I'll turn it over to Brad.","Brad Halverson","Thanks Jim. What a great quarter? The strength in the global economy, as well as favorable pricing promote commodities is benefiting many of our end markets. But what is even more exciting is that all the hard work we've done over the last several years to restructure the business, along with our continued cost discipline while investing for growth, helped drive impressive margins, good cash flow and a strong balance sheet. This strategy is delivering and what we intended, driving profitable growth. This morning I am going to walk you through the financial results for the quarter, and our raised 2018 profit outlook. Then I'll take you through our cash deployment strategy that Jim mentioned.","If you'll turn to Slide 4, that's where we'll start. So, I start with the top line. Sales and revenues of $12.9 billion were up 31% from the first quarter of 2017. About half of the increase was in construction industries and we continue to see strength in mining and North American onshore oil and gas for both new equipment and aftermarket parts. I'll walk through more details on sales when we get to the segments slides.","Moving on to the bottom line. We delivered record first quarter profit per share of $ 2. 74 versus $0.32 a year ago. Note that in 2017, profit per share reflected a large restructuring charge for the closure of our gas Belgian facility. Adjusted profit per share of $2.82 in the current quarter was more than double adjusted profit per share from last year on 31% higher sales and revenues.","We ended the quarter with $7.9 billion of cash on hand and repurchase 500 million of the company's common stock. As I said, a great quarter. Let's move on to Slide 5 and we'll review operating profit. First quarter operating profit was $2.1 billion, compared with operating profit of about $400 million in the first quarter of last year. An improvement of about $1.7 billion. Higher sales volume and the absence of the restructuring charge for gas leaks combined with strong cost control as production volumes increased, explained the profit improvement.","The three primary segments saw strong sales growth. Construction industries up 38% with improvements across all four regions. Resource industries up 31%, reflective of a broad industry recovery. Energy and transportation up 26%, seeing growth across all applications. Both strong and user demand and favorable changes to dealer inventories drove the sales volume growth. The favorable change to dealer inventories was primarily driven by construction industries as the factories work to get inventory to dealers in advance of the spring selling season. As you may recall, this is normal activity for the first quarter and we believe dealer inventories remain aligned with current demand levels.","Price realization was favorable $186 million or 1.6%. Manufacturing cost were about flattened a quarter on a 31% sales and revenue growth. Lower warranty expense and a favorable impact from cost absorption were about offset by higher material and freight cost, as well as higher short-term incentive compensation expense. The increase in material cost was driven largely by steel. We expect steel and other commodity costs to be a headwind all year. However, at the end of the day, higher commodity costs benefit many of our customers and they are one of the reasons we have seen several of our end markets begin to recover. Financial products were unfavorable $48 million, primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses at CAT financial.","Now let's move on to the segments starting with construction industries on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, construction industries drove about half of the sales and revenues growth for the company this quarter. Construction industry's total sales were up 38% to $5.7 billion. Dealers preparing for the spring selling season resulted in favorable changes to dealer inventories. And we believe the increase is supported by current and user demand. Month of sales continues to be low as it relates to inventories as you compare to historical levels. And in China as a result of very high demand, we believe dealer inventories are at levels that are leaner than what will be sustainable.","Additionally, strong global growth improved end-user demand across all regions. Order activity remains strong in the quarter, driving an increase in the backlog. If we look at each region, in North America, dealers prepared for what will be expect to be a strong spring selling season, resulting in favorable changes to dealer inventory. In addition, end-user demand was higher on the strength and non-residential, infrastructure and oil and gas construction activities including the build-out of pipelines. Asia-Pacific saw strength across the region with sales up 46%; about half of the increase was due to higher end user demand in China, which continues to be very robust with growth in building construction and infrastructure.","EAME sales benefit from payroll changes to dealer inventory. A stronger euro and a higher end user demand. Europe is experiencing high business confidence and robust growth, and the commodity producing countries of Africa and the Middle East are experiencing some stabilization, which we believe is encouraging investment in infrastructure and building construction. Latin America while still at historically low levels is starting to improve with sales up 38%, stabilizing economic conditions and improving commodity prices are driving investment in construction activities. Construction industry segment profit of $1.1 billion was about $500 million more than last year, and segment margins improve 4.25 to 19.7%. Higher sales volume and favorable price realization contributed to the profit improvement.","These were partially offset by higher cost for SG&A and R&D, material and freight. SG&A and R&D expenses were up to the higher short-term incentive compensation expense and targeted investments to grow the business.","Let's move to Slide 7. And we'll go through resource industries. Resource industries sales of $2.3 billion increased 31% from the first quarter of last year. This was primarily due to higher end user demand for new equipment across all regions. Strong commodity prices and improve market conditions have improved mining customers profitability. As a result, miners are now investing in replacements for their fleets and initiating mine expansions. And this is driving improved demand for new equipment.","In addition to strong demand for new equipment, demand for aftermarket parts increased as higher production levels resulted in higher machine utilization. Segments profit more than doubled from last year to $378 million and segment margins improved from 9.1% to 16.4%, a significant improvement and above the Investor Day range of 12% to 16%. The improvement in profit was driven by higher sales volume, favorable price realization and favorable variable manufacturing cost, primarily driven by cost absorption. Resource industries discipline cost structure enabled margin improvement. These were partially offset by higher, short-term incentive compensation expense and a slightly unfavorable impact from currency.","Now let's move to Energy and Transportation on Slide 8. Energy and transportation sales of $5.2 billion increased 26% from the first quarter of last year. Oil and gas sales were up $400 million or 50%. Strength continues in North America, specifically for onshore, unconventional oil and gas. While the Permian Basin is the area of highest activity, we are also seeing meaningful activity in other major basins. This continues to drive strong demand for both reciprocating engines and their associated aftermarket parts.","In addition, while demand for new equipment for onshore and offshore drilling remains weak, demand for transmissions, pressure pumps and high pressure flow iron to support well servicing has improved. The delivery of turbines for midstream gas compression to support the build-out of North American natural gas infrastructure remains strong. Sales into power generation were up 35% and improved in all regions. We are seeing demand increases after a multiyear downturn in sales. The largest increase was in the EAME region due to the timing of several large projects and favorable currency impacts. Sales were up in North America from a low 2017 base, due to higher sales from turbines and aftermarket parts sales for reciprocating engines.","New engines and aftermarket sales for industrial applications increased 17%, largely due to improving global economic conditions with Latin America the only region that was not up. Sales in EAME were also positively impacted due to favorable currency impacts.","Transportation sales were up 13%, driven primarily by higher sales in Asia Pacific and North America for rail services. Australia is seeing good growth including from a recent acquisition, and higher rail traffic in North America is driving demand for higher rail services. Marine was up largely due to the timing of deliveries, but the end market especially for offshore vessels continues to be challenged. Segments profit for energy and transportation was $874 million, up about $300 million from the first quarter of last year, and segment margins improved from 13.2% to 16.7%, which is almost in the middle of the Investor day range at lower volume levels.","E&T's profit improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. These were partially offset by a higher short-term incentive compensation expense, and some increased spend for targeted investments. Now let's move on to the outlook on Slide 9. With a great start to the year and with the improvements we are seeing in many of our end markets, we are raising the full-year profit per share outlook to a range of $9.75 to $10.75 and the adjusted profit per share outlook to $10.25 to $11.25. An increase of $2 per share more than a 20% raises. If you move to Slide 10, I'll walk through the key elements of the revised outlook.","The increase in the profit outlook is driven by better than expected sales volume. We expect strong economic conditions to continue and for commodity prices to remain at levels that support capital investments. This is driving and improved sales outlook across the three primary segments. We remain focused on controlling structural cost. While we continue to invest in long-term growth initiatives to expand products and to grow services, our assumptions for these cost increases has not changed since our prior outlook. And we remain committed to a flexible and competitive cost structure and keeping structural cost under control. We've recently received lots of questions from investors about potential impacts from higher commodity prices especially steel. The revised outlook does reflect an assumption for higher material cost. However, we have also increased our estimate for price realization, partially due to a mid-year price increase.","We expect this upward revision to price realization to more than offset material cost increases. Also as I mentioned earlier, at the end of the day, we believe higher commodity prices drive improved marking conditions for many of our end markets. Lastly, on the improved profit outlook, we now expect short-term incentive compensation expense to be about $1.4 billion nearly the same as last year. I want to take a second to discuss the implied rest of the year outlook. As you know, we do not give quarterly guidance. The first quarter was impressive with segment margins that were above our Investor Day targets for both construction and resource industries. While we expect strong operating margins for the rest of the year, which is defined as within our better than the Investor Day ranges. We do not expect to repeat first quarter operating margin at the consolidated level.","And let me explain what is driving some of this change. There were several positives in the fourth quarter that we would not expect to continue for the full year. The price versus material cost delta was very favorable in the first quarter, and better than we expected. We expect this delta of price versus material cost to be negative for the balance of the year. However, as I stated for the full year, we expect price to more than offset material cost. Second CAT inventory grew in the quarter to support higher production. Our expectation is that inventory levels will come down which would result in unfavorable changes to cost absorption. And it's often the case the first quarter got off to a slow start for projects spent. We expected targeted investments for future growth to be higher over the remaining three quarters. The outlook assumes that first quarter adjusted profit per share will be the high-water mark for the year.","Now let's discuss the segment sales assumptions moving to Slide 11. For construction industries, we expect sales up across all regions. Strong economic conditions, strength in the oil patch and funding for pipelines and state and local infrastructure investments should continue to drive robust demand in North America. Asia-Pacific should remain robust with China leading the region. We now expect industry sales for the ten ton and above excavator to be about up 30% versus last year. EAME is benefiting from strong business confidence and stability in oil prices. And while Latin America sales are still at historically low levels, economic conditions are improving. For resource industries, favorable commodity prices and positive global economic factors have helped the financial health of our customers and improve business confidence. We expect improving profitability of our mining customers to drive higher capital expenditures for replacements and mine expansions. Strong global economic conditions should support higher sales of equipment for heavy construction and quarry and aggregate machines.","Lastly, we expect production levels for our customer base to be maintained, supporting consistent aftermarket parts demand. Energy and transportation, in oil and gas, stable oil prices should continue to drive strong demand for wealth servicing and gas compression applications and rebuild activity in North America. However, demand for onshore drilling and new offshore drilling and production are expected to remain at lower levels. After a multi-year downturn, we are seeing signs of improvement in power generation, driven largely by improving economic conditions. Good economic growth should also benefit industrial engines and we have increased our full-year sales forecast primarily due to higher projected demand in EAME.","Lastly improvements in North America rail traffic and a focus on growing services is expected to drive improve sales for transportation. However, marine and new locomotives remain challenged. Let's move to Slide 12 and discuss our cash deployment strategy. While not a significant change from previously communicated priorities, there are some differences I want to review. The refreshed cash deployment methodology reflects the fact that our cash priorities will vary from time to time, depending on circumstances and where we are in the cycle. Having said that, we think about it in a following way. Our first priority is to maintain a healthy balance sheet in support of a mid-A credit rating. Next, we intend to deploy to cash necessary to run the business, described here as operational excellence and commitments. Finally, the use of discretionary cash is shown at the bottom of the chart. We intend a fund profitable growth while still returning capital to shareholders. Caterpillar has paid higher dividends each of the past 24 years; sustainable dividend growth remains a very high priority for us. As you saw in the release, we also repurchased about 500 million of common stock in the first quarter.","Our strategy for share repurchases is to be in the market more consistently with intent to offset the impact of dilution over time. In our prior cash deployment priorities, we often viewed profitable growth funding as investments in capacity. As we said an Investor Day, we feel we have the necessary bricks and mortar capacity that we need and expect CapEx to be about $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the foreseeable future. Given our current capacity, we have refocused profitable growth funding to be in line with the new strategy. We intend to fund initiatives that drive long-term profitable growth, heavily focused in the areas of expanded offering and services including M&A where it makes sense.","Now let's turn to Slide 13 for a quick summary before we get to the Q&A. So in summary, sales and revenues were up 31%. We had a record first quarter profit per share and adjusted profit per share more than doubled from a year ago. It's a quarter that all of us are definitely proud of. The strategy is working. We are focused on structural cost control, while investing for profitable growth. And we are delivering significant margin improvements. The balance sheet is strong, cash flow is good and we bought back 500 million of common stock. And going forward, planned to offset dilution over time.","Lastly improving global economic conditions and our continued focus on cost discipline enabled us to raise a 2018 outlook range by $2 per share. We are proud of a high quality financial performance in the quarter. The Caterpillar team has worked hard to reduce structural cost, while investing in the business. And this quarter reflects the fruits of that tremendous effort. As we look forward, I believe the company is focused in the right areas to continue to drive future profitable growth.","With that I'll turn it back to you, Amy.","Amy Campbell","All right. It's okay. I think we're ready for the question and answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Our first question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation then pose your questions.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning, Credit Suisse. I guess two questions. One some follow-up on your capital allocation priorities. I understand what you outlined but given the lack of internal investment that you need for capacity and you said you'll repurchase shares to offset Cree but it's I mean it's still you're still going to have plenty of cash. So I don't feel like that answers all the questions. So how do you think about a more meaningful share repurchase versus just offsetting Cree and can you talk about your view on M&A and how we should think about larger M&A over the cycle and then my second question given the performance that we've seen in particular on within the construction business and the resource businesses in the quarter, and even last year to some degree, how do we think about the margins in those business longer term given that we're already exceeding the target - your longer term targets that you put out in September. Thanks.","Jim Umpleby","Hi, Jamie, this is Jim. Just starting with an M&A question. So all of our business leaders continually evaluate opportunities for M&A, nothing new so at any one time there's dozens of things we're evaluating. And so again we'll - we're ready to make acquisitions as they make sense for us. We've talked previously about the fact that we are very focused on expanding offerings and services, and that's where both our organic and our external investment will go, that's a big priority for us. In terms of the margin question, certainly we have experienced strong margins in the first quarter. Our goal is to grow the business and we talked in the yesterday about the fact that we are focused on growing absolute OpEx dollars, that's our focus. And so again we want to have a healthy operating margin range, but we really want to invest to grow and that's what we're contending to do.","Jamie Cook","But just back - sorry on the share repurchase I mean given the pullback in your stock, the numbers that you guys are putting up which are much better than even the targets were that you talked about in September. How do you think about a more meaningful share repurchase?","Jim Umpleby","We don't have anything to announce really at this time. Again, as I said we'll be in the market and consistent basis to offset dilution over time. We don't have any announcements today about any kind of share repurchase.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Courtney Yakavonis. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Courtney Yakavonis","Hi, thanks, Morgan Stanley. Just wanted to get a quick update on your view of commodity inflation. I think you mentioned that those continue to be a headwind and you did raise your expectations in this guidance, but can you just give us a sense of how much you expecting, to higher inflation already in your current guidance? And then a second question if you can just talk about your expectations for China? I think last time you had given us an expectation for about 8% growth. I am just curious if you can give us an updated view there.","Jim Umpleby","Jim, you want to start with my question or would you like to -","Jim Umpleby","Go ahead Amy.","Amy Campbell","All right. So, Courtney, you're correct, we started off the year expected material costs to be higher. We started to see some material cost increases in the back half of 2017. For the industry, steel prices I think were up about 40% last year. I think they were up about 15% for the industry in the first quarter. We have not seen that type of cost increase flow to through to our results, but we have seen material cost increases most notably for steel continue to increase. And as we said, we now expect material cost increases to be higher for the full year than we thought they would be in the fourth quarter outlook, and that is primarily driven by steel. There are a lot of factors that are driving those steel cost increases, but what we pointed out is that we continue to expect price realization to offset those material cost increases. And in fact, from the fourth-quarter outlook to this outlook, we now expect the price realization increase was actually larger than the material cost increase so that gap grew a little bit, not a significant amount but it did grow a little bit favorable versus what we had in the fourth quarter outlook. And on China expectations, you're correct; we started the year expecting industry demand to be up about 8%. We tend to focus on the ten-ton and above excavator as we talk about specific numbers for industry demand. China continues to be stronger than we expect. We now expect the China 10-ton and above excavator demand to be up 30% this year. At that level that's about 88,000 excavators for the industry, that's probably about 20% to 25% above where we think normal replacement demand and the macro environment in China supports. But we do at this point continue to expect China to be very strong for the rest of the year. That said, we expect normal sales patterns in China, so we expect about 60% of end-user demand to come in the first half of the year, and about 40% of end-user demand to be in the back half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our neck question today is coming from Ross Gilardi. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Ross Gilardi","Hey, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Hey, good morning ,everybody. So I just want to ask you about this mid-year price increase. Our competitor is matching it and how are you presenting it? I mean it's a cost-push price increase or is it just because demand is so strong right now and you end up in a situation where you feel pressure to lower price if your input costs go down?","Amy Campbell","So, Ross, there's a lot of factors that go into pricing. Certainly key to them is our strategic initiatives and our focus on profitable growth. We began mid-year price increases several months ago discussions around what was appropriate and the market environment that we're seeing today. And the mid-year price increase which is primarily for construction industries products and some resource industries products that are largely used in heavy construction activities is where we took that major price increase.","Joe Creed","And this is Joe, this is when it was a modest increase and I wouldn't view it as a surcharge that would drop it based on commodity prices or anything.","Ross Gilardi","What are you seeing competitively, Amy? Are you seeing other OEMs do the same thing?","Amy Campbell","Yes. So I mean I think we're only feeling appropriate to talk about our actions. We certainly read the same information that you do, but I think it's only appropriate at this time to talk about our pricing actions not those of others.","Ross Gilardi","Okay, fair enough. And then just about mining aftermarket. I mean you had just a huge year last year. Obviously your results improve quite a bit in the segment but seeing any signs to slow down in spare parts demand from mining equipment as rebuild activities already been completed and any more granularities you can provide on kind of a new equipment environment?","Amy Campbell","Sure. So the short answer is no. We're not seeing any slowdown and aftermarket parts demand for mining. We continue to see robust rebuild demand; strong utilization in the mines is driving improving aftermarket parts demand and orders. So we expect increases in aftermarket parts for the full year 2018. However, we are expecting even from a percentage basis more significant increases and new equipment for mining. So after several years of underinvestment and replacement demand and some new mining expansion, we expect new equipment sales to grow by more than aftermarket parts sales this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning, it's RBC. I actually wanted to follow up on the resource margin question a little bit more. So profits were up basically double on kind of flattish revenue sequentially. And I'm - I think what I heard you say was that the first quarter had more equipment sales, that equipment sales were particularly strong in the first quarter. So I'm just trying to tie a lot of this stuff together with kind of margin trajectory for the resource business, just the big ramp that we saw in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. And then just kind of - while I guess addressed the mix going forward but should we still expect margin expansion from the first quarter level I guess my question.","Amy Campbell","Yes. So a couple of things in there. The resource margin largely driven by volume increases. So resource industries saw a 31% volume increase driven by higher end user demand. That was the biggest driver. They also had some favorable price realization and really kept their cost relatively flat on that significant volume increase. So that drove a lot of margin improvement. One thing that we point out at the consolidated level that's impacting resource industries margins as we move throughout the year is cost absorption. So resource industries saw a significant increase in inventory in the quarter, which had a favorable impact to their margins and to their performance in the quarter. They now expect their inventory to be about flat for the rest of the year, which will have a negative impact and cost absorbs and for the remainder of the year. So a resource industry does expect their margins to come down from the first quarter, but to remain within the Investor Day range for the full year. And at resource industries volume levels, a few changes like cost absorption can have a meaningful impact in margin performance but for the full year we do expect resource industries to be within the Investor Day range.","Seth Weber","Okay, that's helpful, Amy, thank you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the Finco. It does sound like some of the metrics did tick up here and I think you called out power, CAT power finance and some other Latin American business, is that isolated project activity or can you just give us any more color what's going on there?","Amy Campbell","Yes. So CAT financials normal business in the quarter was quite good. Average assets were up, margins expanded. There was some weakness in the CAT power finance and LATAM portfolios as you discussed, and even in the CAT Power Finance, a significant portion of that was in Latin America. So it's a reflection of some weakness in Latin America that we all are well aware of and has been there for some time putting some pressure on that portfolio. There are also some unique just financing rules and issues in LATAM about being able to get inventory back and how you process through past use. And so overall, no, it's really mostly very specific to Latin America and the weakness we've seen in the recent past in that economy. And outside of that it was really just one or two customer issues that were going through some financial challenges and had some restructures to their loans.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation then pose your questions.","David Raso","Hi, Evercore ISI. Just a clarification I think you mentioned first quarter EPS would be the high-water mark for the year by quarter. And I'm just trying to make sure I understand, in the last 20 years your second quarter has always been above your first quarter except for twice, right, when oil and gas was rolling over in 2015 and in 2011 when Cyrus and the Japanese disaster hit the quarter. So kind of unique circumstance. and I know you just commented a bit on resource but can you help us understand a little more the puts and takes on why such an anomaly of the first quarter being a high-water mark? The idea the investments might be interesting if you can maybe flush out some numbers around that, the price costs won't be as positive as the first quarter, but as you said if anything for the full year, your view even get a little better for price cost, now maybe a lot of it was in the first quarter already, I appreciate that but I'm just making sure we understand why such anomaly that the second quarter is below the first quarter.","Amy Campbell","Yes. So there are three reasons why we see the first quarter profit per share to be the high-water mark and you mentioned all three of them. I'll go through them again. Price versus material cost, very favorable on the first quarter. We expect to be favorable for the full year but for the balance of the year we would expect material cost increases to be greater than price realization.","David Raso","And Amy if I can stop you there for a second, if I'm seeing a waterfall chart right, price realization with healthful manufacturing costs for a positive 207, is that the right way to read it on the consolidated operating profit, the waterfall chart?","Amy Campbell","So we've got price realization I think was $186 million in the quarter","David Raso","And the cost were positive 21 so called it 207. So if you think a full-year still positive. It can't take out more than $207 million. So I mean its $50million, $60 million a quarter drag. So that's $0.06. I'm just making sure I understand where are the magnitudes to create such an anomaly in your seasonal pattern of earnings.","Amy Campbell","Yes. So manufacturing costs, a significant piece of that favorability was cost absorption. So with the inventory growth in the quarter which I believe was $900 million or so that drew favorable cost absorption. We do not expect that - we expect that to actually be an unfavorable item for the balance of the year. So it is there --there is negative material cost and that manufacturing cost bucket and favorable cost of absorption that will not repeat itself. In addition to that, we do talk about period cost spend which is twofold. One is just normal seasonality of spent. So the first quarter is often a slow quarter for project spending as R&D projects pick up throughout the year? And then many of our target initiatives for e-commerce, for digital, for expanding products like the NextGen got off to a slower start than we expected, and we expect those projects to get back on track as we proceed throughout the year.","David Raso","And can you flush that last part out. Is the other part about starting year slowly and ramping up that's part of the normal seasonal pattern we've seen? So that doesn't answer the anomaly question. The target investment so it could be helpful. Can you give us some order of magnitude on how big these target investments ramp up as the year goes?","Amy Campbell","I don't have a specific number to give you, David. I mean what we did talk about is that we did not change our estimate for those for the full year, but we got off to a slow start in the first quarter. So we kept our fourth quarter outlook for investing and those target initiatives are the same but under spent on those in the first quarter.","David Raso","Okay. There's not - if there's nothing else to point at that, that's helpful, I appreciate the feedback. It just seems a bit of an odd - an odd seasonal I mean it just seems the last two times we've had the first quarter be even this low percent of the full year guide. You kind of have to go back to paying, we were peaking in early 2012 and we rolled over by the end of the year or oil and gas started to roll over in 2015. I'm just making sure we all don't walk away saying hey that was the best quarter they're going to give us period. Is that the only the time that's happened is we peaked in early 2012 and oil and gas hit us broadly in 2015. So I'm just being clear with what you are trying to communicate.","Amy Campbell","Yes. So very clearly we are trying to communicate that we see strong demand across all regions and most of our end markets increasing from our fourth-quarter outlook. And so driving the first quarter raise is an increase in our sales volume expectations which implies that we see continued good growth for the balance of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announcer affiliation then pose your questions.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning, JPMorgan. Can I just take a step back on the price cost comments that you made. I just want to make sure I understand did you specifically say the price cost will be a negative for the remainder of the year for each of the quarters? And, if so, since you're pushing through a price increase in an environment where backlogs are very solid why wouldn't you push through a price increase sufficient to offset input costs and what does that mean for 2019 if we're behind going into 2019?","Amy Campbell","So a couple things. Yes, you're correct that we said that for the balance of the year price versus cost would be negative. We don't give quarterly guidance. In fact, I don't have the breakout of what that will be quarter \u2013 by quarter, but for the rest of the year that comparison will be negative and certainly as we sit here today at the end of the first quarter, we're a long way from looking out into what 2019 will look like. And we do and Brad said this a couple times in his script continue to stress that at the end of the day higher commodity prices are a good thing for our end markets. And we're seeing that translate into improvements across many for many our customers. As far as the price question, we have good margins, it's a competitive marketplace, continues to be a competitive marketplace. And at the key point of our strategic strategy is to profitably grow the business.","Ann Duignan","But just then as a follow-up on the backlogs could you just talk about mix in your backlogs by segments? I know you did address resource but are there any positive or negative kinds of product mix in the backlogs that we should be aware of as we look at the remainder of the year? Thank you\/","Amy Campbell","Sure. So the growth in the backlog was driven by construction energies and energy and transportation, resource industries backlog was flat and sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017 driven really by two things. One, we had a very strong order board in the fourth quarter. We saw some of those orders-- we didn't - so I guess I would say it that way we saw a very strong fourth quarter and then velocity for shipment really picked up in the first quarter. So we were able to keep up with orders and get throughput and shipments out the door. Construction industries backlog increase is reflective of continued strong demand and construction industries. And I say the same for energy and transportation, the biggest piece of that for reciprocating engine largely for North America onshore oil and gas. And I know there's always a lot of interest, so our backlog remains healthy and was flat - about flat sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.","Ann Duignan","And just quickly on construction. Any change in mix of the backlog more compact, more large not anything we should consider that would negatively or positively impact mix?","Amy Campbell","Yes. I would say broadly speaking that we're not seeing much significant mix impact across the segments in our outlook. It's not an area that we're focusing on really positively or negatively. It's over the entire portfolio is pretty balanced.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Jerry Revich","Hi, good morning, it's Goldman Sachs. I'm wondering if you could talk about your expectations of period costs over the course of this cycle over your prior recoveries around year two, year three was when we would see period costs really move higher? I'm wondering if you can counsel somehow to think about it given a difference in the approach to CapEx and post restructuring is this level of period cost performance that you put up in the quarter sustainable?","Jim Umpleby","This is Jim. So, Jerry, we are certainly committed to controlling structural cost as we've said many times. We are going to making targeted investments and those are in the areas of expanded offerings and services. And so in the past when we wanted to grow was through either R&D for new products, we build the factories or we make an acquisition. So now we're really looking at in making some investments again in services. We're expanding our digital capabilities and so some of that will involve period cost, period cost but again we're very committed to keeping our structural cost under control. So I think I answered your question but again we'll make some targeted investments, but we're not, just don't let cost creep up the way they have in the past.","Jerry Revich","And Jim the returns profile of those investments over what period do you expect an ROI? Is it a long-term strategic type of investment that we should be thinking about or is it more quick hitting within two years we'll see the earnings benefit of any related period investments?","Jim Umpleby","Yes. There isn't one answer to the question. So for some of them that would be a longer term and for some they will be relatively short. So again as we focus on the aftermarket generally many of those investments should produce relatively short-term returns and some will be more long-term.","Jerry Revich","Okay and then structurally how do you think about your expected level of dealer inventories in this cycle? If I have it right I think your dealer inventories are down half a month to a month from the last cycle. Is that the level that you expect to see in this cycle? Can you just put that into context for us considering how much dealer inventories can move early in the year?","Amy Campbell","Yes. So, Jerry, maybe I'll step back a little bit, dealer inventory levels in terms of months of sales are at the bottom end of our current range that we think about, but keep in mind that dealer inventories are controlled by the dealers or independently owned and operated. So ultimately they have the decision power there. But we have moved I would say from a targeted range for dealer inventories in terms of months of sales from three and a half to four months of sales down to about three to three and a half months of sales. So as you hear us talk about that it probably is lower than where we were in the prior cycle. Right now we're at the bottom end of that range and in some regions most notably in China were actually well below that range, and we expect at some point I guess over the long that won't be sustainable, we'll have to see some dealer inventory come back into or Chinese dealers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Rob Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Rob Wertheimer","It's Melius Research, thank you. The question is just a philosophical one I guess for Jim on margins. How did you think about setting the margin targets that you did at the Investor Day? And I assume that you think you can grow profitably and maybe even gain share at those target levels. How do you think about - is you as you achieve - as you have really exceptional results whether you let them drift above that cyclically or not, we're at low cycle or mid cycle now. And where they'll just above or not and how you think about competitiveness and balancing what margin you take? Thanks.","Jim Umpleby","Yes. So it certainly as a balance. So to answer your first question how do we establish the margins? We looked at the margins that we achieved at similar sales levels in the recent past and we put forward what we thought was a reasonable expectation for our teams to improve margins. Now as we've said, again both this morning and in Investor Day, our goal is to profitably grow and we want to make investments to grow within a healthy range. We're not too concerned about quarterly deviations because we expect quarter to-quarter that there'll be some movement there, but again we're trying to grow the business over the long term in a healthy margin rate.","Rob Wertheimer","And then you - I assume you think you can grow share a little bit in those ranges and would you let margins drift above that if we had cycle volumes at some point. We should have been obviously?","Jim Umpleby","Yes. It is a balance and obviously one of the things trying to do is grow the aftermarket and have aftermarket you need to have market share of new equipment. So it's always a balance that we - there's no one answer to the question but yes we want to increase share we do, and it's always a balance between margins and share, but again our goal here is to grow the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joe O'Dea. Please announcer affiliation then pose your questions.","Joe O'Dea","Hi, it's Vertical Research. First just back on dealer inventory and when you look at the $1.2 billion of build in the quarter and it sounds like that's primarily expected to go to end market demand this year. So are you looking at no net build and dealer inventory? And then if that is the case where would you be on inventory to on months of inventory as you get to the end of the year?","Amy Campbell","Yes. So your assumption is correct, Joe. We expect dealer inventory to end the year about where we are now at the end of the first quarter, maybe up or down a little bit, but I think broadly speaking to end the year pretty close to where we ended the first quarter. We do expect construction industries dealer inventory come down in the second quarter on a strong selling season. And at the same time, we expect resource industries dealer inventory to come up in the second quarter on continued kind of build out and support of strong demand and user demand for resource industries. And then for that inventory to again come down by the end of the year. I don't have an estimate a month of sales for the end of year, and quite frankly as we all know ultimately where we in dealer inventory will have a lot to do with the 2019 outlook is. And we're not giving that today, and so I think kind of estimating what months of sales will be and frankly well I walk through what our outlook includes exactly knowing where dealer inventory will be at the end of the year. It's a lot to do with where dealers are and where an expectation for 2019 for the dealers comes in it.","Joe O'Dea","Okay, thanks. And then on mining equipment and you're talking about seeing demand both on replacement as well as initiated expansions. And I guess specific to the expansions, given the amount of equipment that was sold in 2011 and 2012, so I'm thinking that there's enough equipment on the sidelines that it can come back into service for a while. But where are we there? Are we had a point where through cannibalization and the amount of equipment that's back in service that we're getting to more normalized levels of parked fleet and that from here we're looking at needing OE to serve that demand? Just kind of a status update on un-parked fleet and the drivers of that new equipment demand?","Amy Campbell","Sure. So the parked fleet does continue to come down, rebuilds remain robust. We expect them to be robust throughout the rest of the year. So I would say that there are still trucks that come back online in our estimation. It has - there's a lot of complexities about bringing the parked fleet online versus expansions where's that parked fleet add versus where are the expansions in mines at, and there are so many things driving new equipment demand expansions being one, but also replacing equipment which has been delayed for some time now also being a significant driver of new equipment demand. And so we do - I think in short we do have the parked fleet continuing to come down, rebuild, driving and aftermarket parts sales continues to be robust. And where that new equipment is I guess kind of in short term it's pretty broad around the globe and pretty broad by commodity. So the recovery in mining that's occurring continues to be pretty broad-based.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation then pose your questions","Andrew Casey","Wells Fargo Securities, good morning, everybody. I just want to make sure I'm understanding some of the messaging coming out of this call because during the call the stocks kind of sold off quite a bit. You're kind of pulling back expectations on share repurchase and yet it seems like you're going to be generating quite a bit of cash through the year especially given the implied inventory drawdown. What are you looking to use that cash for? I know you've identified that the deployment options. Are we - should we kind of walk away from this call looking like you're a little concerned about peak or are you looking at an evaluating an active pipeline with an M&A? And if so, could you please share a ballpark average deal size you might be contemplating?","Jim Umpleby","And this is Jim. So it certainly wasn't our intent to express a concern about peak to use your words, really no change here in terms of us continually looking at M&A opportunities. Obviously, our cash position has improved over the last year and that allows us the flexibility to make investments both organically and in M&A. And again, we're not ruling anything out. So I said about share repurchase we didn't have an announcement to make today. And again, we're looking at staying with our strategy to grow our business as we communicated in Investor Day.","Brad Halverson","Yes. This is Brad. So my guess is you guys are modeling and you see potentially some strong cash flow moving forward and want to know what we're going to do with it. And I think what Jim has says we're going to continue to invest in the business, may be different than the past we're going to be in the market in a more continuous basis for stock repurchase to offset dilution. We are continuing to look to grow and do the M&A business. I think what we're saying is that we're not going to answer that question right now that you have potentially on your mind as to what we would do with the excess cash that could happen down the road. We're not saying it wouldn't be a repurchase; we're just not answering it right now.","Andrew Casey","Okay, thank you. And then one last question as this gets to the cycle for a business that's enjoying some really strong demand trends. If we look at construction industries and exclude the China market could you kind of give us kind of a ballpark range maybe percentage or however you want to potentially answer it, where is construction industry unit volume relative to peak if we exclude the China market?","Amy Campbell","So, Andy, I don't have that number off the top of my head. I think if you look - you have to look market by market, North America is doing strong but I think one could argue we're just starting to see healthy new home constructions, infrastructure remains far below potential. LATAM is just starting to recover and is well below the sales levels that it was a few years ago. And you could say the same thing about Europe which has been strong from some time now, but in total is far below where sales were in Europe decades ago. I mean EAME portion, of EAME have seen some weakness in the last few years, and they're starting to see a little bit of turnaround and improvement as well. So I think it is a different story across the different regions of construction industries, region like China we've been pretty clear. We think is quite robust and above where we think normal robust demand, another region like Latin America is still from a historical perspective at very low levels. With that I think that needs to be the last question. Kate?","Operator","Thank you. Do you have any closing comments you'd like to finish with?","Jim Umpleby","Yes.

Ma\u2019am, the floor is yours.","Amy Campbell","Thank you, Kate. Good morning. And welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings call. On the call today, I am pleased to have our CEO, Jim Umpleby; and our CFO, Andrew Bonfield, and our Vice President of finance services Joe Creed.","Remember, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you\u2019d like a copy of today\u2019s call transcript, we\u2019ll be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website.","This morning we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information discussed. Details on the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our filings with the SEC and our forward-looking statements included in today's financial release.","In addition a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this morning's presentation and in our release which is posted at caterpillar.com\/earnings.","With that I'll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Umpleby","Thank you Amy and good morning. First I'd like to introduce Andrew Bonfield our new Chief Financial Officer. Andrew joined Caterpillar on September 1. Andrew has more than three decades of global financial experience. Most recently he was grouped CFO and board member of National Grid PLC, a British multinational electricity and gas utility company. Prior to National Grid Andrew was Chief Financial Officer at Cadbury PLC and also served as executive Vice President and Chief Financial officer at Bristol-Myers Squibb. We are delighted to have Andrew on board. He's a welcome addition to our company and our executive office.","Andrew will walk you through our financial results and after I provide a brief overview of our third quarter performance as well as our outlook. We had an outstanding quarter thanks to both higher sales and excellent operational performance. Many of our mid end markets continue to be strong. Sales and revenue were $13.5 billion and 18% increase over the third quarter of last year.","We also earned profit per share of $2.88 which is the highest third quarter profit per share in Caterpillar's 93-year history. This is the third consecutive quarter our company has delivered record profit per share. Adjusted profit per share was $2.86 up 47% from the third quarter of 2017.","Third quarter operating profit was about $2.1 billion, 41% more than the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 16.6% that's 260 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2017 and consistent with the first half of this year despite input cost headwinds. These profit levels and margins are due to the excellent work of our global team and demonstrate that our strategy for long-term profitable growth and our discipline on structural costs are delivering measurable performance improvements.","We finished the quarter with $8 billion of enterprise cash. That's after paying more than $500 million in dividends, repurchasing $750 million of Caterpillar common stock and making a $1 billion discretionary pension contribution.","In the first nine months of 2018, we've returned $3.4 billion to shareholders. Our solid operational performance gives us the flexibility to invest on growth and to continue returning capital to shareholders. We intend to continue doing both in a sustained and disciplined way.","Using the operating and execution model as our guide we will continue to invest in areas that represents a significant opportunities for profitable organic growth especially in services and new and enhanced offerings which are key components of our strategy. We also continue to look at non-organic growth opportunities, but we will do so in a disciplined way.","Let me walk you through some examples of how we're investing for future growth. We continue to deploy more digital service offerings in autonomy and automation technology for mining. We're collaborating with a gold-mining customer in Nevada supported by our local CAT dealer to automate underground loaders and enable machine operators to work safely and efficiently from a control room on the surface. We're improving existing technology and accelerating deployment of new features.","We're also working with a mining customer in Western Australia where we've secured a deal for the first commercial installation of a retrofit kit to enable autonomous operation of competitor mining trucks using Cat MineStar command for hauling. With this Cat system customers can operate different brands and sizes of trucks, both manned and autonomous in the same space and scale up fleet size to meet the mines' needs.","Our autonomous solutions are demonstrating significant productivity improvements for our customers. We also continue to roll out expanded product offerings to meet the diverse needs of our customers. Last month we expanded the articulated dump truck lineup by reintroducing the 40-ton size class with a new Cat 740 GC model that incorporates proven features and performance including new controls and systems for transmission protection, stability assist, and advanced traction control and a fuel saving eco mode.","Just last week we unveiled several new Cat mini hydraulic excavator models in the 1 to 2 ton and 7 to 10 ton size classes. These mini hexes are part of our next generation excavator roll out up again in 2017. We believe these new models provide the best performance, versatility, safety, operator convenience, and affordability in these size classes. With these machines we're also reaching out to a broader customer base to local and regional contractors who may be in the market for their first yellow iron Cat machine.","These examples of digital technology services and expanded offerings are part of our mission to help our customers both current and future be more successful with Caterpillar than with any of our competitors.","Now for the outlook. Our profit per share outlook for the year is $10.65 to $11.65 and we've maintained the guidance given last quarter for adjusted profit per share in the range of $11 to $12. We expect normal seasonal patterns for sales growth in the fourth quarter and also expect to continue our strong operational performance. As we discussed with you last quarter Caterpillar participates in diverse end markets. Many of our end markets are in the early stages of recovery while others are experiencing robust demand. We feel good about the state of our business. We continue to monitor end market fundamentals, we will provide 2019 guidance in January.","Currently, we believe favorable commodity prices, strong economic growth, and the global need for infrastructure will continue to drive strong and user demand across many of our end markets. More specifically we believe economic fundamentals, attractive oil prices, and the need for oil and gas infrastructure are positive for construction industries in North America. For Asia-Pacific while sales for CI remain strong across the region we continue to monitor China demand to determine the trajectory of future sales.","For the remainder of 2018 we expect normal seasonal trends for China. In EAME, in Latin America we are seeing positive signs for CI in most countries but there have been some recent areas of weakness which we believe will be contained. For resource industries robust economic growth and infrastructure investments are driving strong demand in heavy construction applications which we expect to continue. While our global mining customer sales are improving the recovery is still in the early stages and we expect higher demand for new equipment moving forward.","Energy and transportation is our most diverse segment and serves a wide variety of end markets. Current oil prices are positive for E&T. Sales in the North American compression and while service applications remain very strong. Well, there have been take away capacity issues in the Permian basin we are seeing increased activity across other basins and expect production and the Permian to grow after the capacity issues are addressed.","Demand for new equipment for onshore and offshore drilling as well as offshore oil and gas production remained weak. We continue to see positive momentum and power generation. The North American rail market is also showing signs of recovery. Total car loads improved and stored locomotives are down from a year ago. We are seeing an increase in activity for new locomotives as well as demand increases for rail services and locomotive rebuilds.","In summary, we feel good about the fundamentals of many of our end markets despite the presence of geopolitical risks and global trade tensions. We're focused on a strong finish to 2018 and we'll share more about our 2019 outlook in January.","With that I'll turn it over to Andrew.","Andrew Bonfield","Thank you Jim and good morning every one. First, I just wanted to say how excited I am to join Caterpillar. In particular it's great to be here today to share such an impressive set of results with you.","Let's start by turning to slide three, and I will discuss the third quarter financial results in a bit more detail. Sales and revenues were $13.5 billion, up 18% from last year with continued growth across all three of our primary segments. While many of our end markets continue to improve, North American economic strength and oil price stability drove higher levels of construction activity as well as higher demand for well servicing and gas compression equipment. In addition, resource industries machine sales were up significantly.","Third quarter profit per share of $2.88 and adjusted profit per share of $2.86 are up 63% and 47% from year ago on higher sales, improved operational performance, and disciplined resource allocation. As Jim noted this was a record third quarter profit per share performance and these results demonstrate that our strategy is working.","If you move to slide four, I will walk through what drove the 41% increase in operating profit. As you can see in the chart higher sales volume contributed $793 million, more operating profit compared to last year. Price realization was $155 million or about 1% higher than the third quarter of last year. Manufacturing costs increased by $205 million due to higher material and freight costs. In all, material costs were off about 2% on highest fuel prices and the impacts of tariffs. Freight costs continues to be elevated due to a variety of factors including higher rates, less efficient loads, an expedited freight costs as we ramp up production to meet increased demand. Even though the mid-year price increase had only a partial impact in the quarter the drag of higher input costs and tariffs was just $50 million more than price realization.","We are also continuing to look for operational efficiencies to reduce the impact further. We expect that this effort plus the benefit of mid-year price increase will further moderate the impact of material and freight costs in the fourth quarter.","SG&A and R&D costs were up $77 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 5% compared to an 18% increase in sales and revenues. Jim gave a few examples of how we are investing that money to drive long-term shareholder return but this cost discipline is a key factor in improving our operating margins.","Financial products was favorable by $36 million as the core business continues to perform well with higher financing rates, a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment, and higher average earning assets in North America and Asia-Pacific. [indiscernible]increased this year this is largely isolated to a few customers in Latin America experiencing economic challenges and in the Cat power finance portfolio. Overall we believe the portfolio remains healthy.","The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 16.6% which is on the high end of our Investor Day range and 260 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2017.","Now let's look at the performance of each segment beginning with construction industries on slide five. Sales were $5.7 billion in the third quarter, an increase of $0.8 billion or 16%. CI sales increased across all regions except Latin America. Sales in North America were up almost $0.5 billion and North America drive about 60% of the total third quarter sales growth. Much of this was driven by oil and gas related projects including pipelines and other non residential construction growth.","Asia-Pacific sales were up 19% or $239 million with the most significant increase continuing to be from China. In the quarter our dealers in China were able to restock from very low to more normal levels of inventory. We continue to expect industry sales for 10-ton and above excavators to be up about 40% for the full year. Since there has been some speculation about level of sales in China I wanted to clarify that for construction industries sales in China range from 10% to 15% of total segment sales and China accounts for 5% to 10% of total company sales from revenues. Outside China most of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region had higher sales on broad economic strength.","Overall EMEA sales were up 10% and Latin American sales were down slightly. While higher demand for infrastructure and building construction activities in both of these regions were broadly favorable, isolated economic uncertainties in Turkey, South Africa, and Argentina did have a negative impact on these markets in the quarter.","Turning to profit, CI segments profit increased by 20% over the last year to $1.1 billion. Operating margin was 18.6% which is higher than the investor day range as construction industries continues to demonstrate the power of the operating and execution model to allocate resources to grow profitably and grow control costs.","Let's move to slide six. The resource industries team also turned in another great quarter. RI sales were $2.6 billion, up 35% from the third quarter of 2017. Sales for new equipment increased across all regions and demand for aftermarket parts remained strong to support overhauls and maintenance. In fact this was the highest quarter for sales since the fourth quarter of 2013.","Our mining customers are placing orders for new equipment as commodity prices remain above investment thresholds. However, our customers globally continue to focus on improving the productivity and efficiency of their existing machine assets thereby delaying full fleet replacements.","In addition to the recovery mining, strong global economic growth and infrastructure investment also contributed to higher sales for heavy construction equipment. Segment profit of $414 million was up 81% versus third quarter of last year. Segment operating margin improved 15.7% at the top end of the Investor day range of 12% to 16% and up 400 basis points from 2017.","RI's improved performance and margin expansion is primarily due to higher sales; improved price realization of more than 4% and the operating leverage gained through significant restructuring and the team's disciplined cost management. These gains were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including freight and material costs and higher SG&A and R&D expenses to invest for profitable growth.","Now let's turn to slide 7 where we will discuss energy and transportation. E&T sales in the third quarter were $5.6 billion, 15% higher than the same quarter last year with sales increasing across all applications except industrial. Sales into oil and gas applications were up by $297 million or 28% as we continue to see strength in onshore activity in North America especially for gas compression and well servicing applications.","Power generation sales increased by $204 million or 23% driven primarily by sales of reciprocating engines to support data center and power plant applications as well as higher aftermarket part sales. Industrial application sales were down 2% largely due to economic activity in Turkey. However, sales in North America and Asia-Pacific increased slightly over the third quarter of last year. Transportation sales were up 12%. This sales growth continues to be driven by a recent European and Australian mail service acquisitions and higher North American rail traffic.","Segment profit for energy and transportation was $973 million, up $230 million from the third quarter of last year. The segment margin improved by 210 basis points to 17.5% which is also at the high end of the Investor day range. E&T's profit improvement was mostly due to the higher sales volume but this was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and increased SG&A and R&D expenses.","I want to spend a few moments discussing cash flow which is shown on slide 8. Our ME&T operating cash flow was $848 million for the third quarter and we finished the quarter with $8 billion of enterprise cash on hand. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $237 million higher than last year reflecting the higher profits but after taking into account a $1 billion discretionary pension fund contribution. This pension contribution gave rise to a favorable tax deduction and also provides cash flow flexibility for the next few years. As Jim mentioned we've continued to return capital to shareholders with $511 million of dividends paid and the repurchase of $750 million of Caterpillar stock in the quarter.","We remain committed to investing to profitably grow our business. Our current operational performance has provided the added benefit of strong operating cash flows to a solid balance sheet.","We intend to use this flexibility to both invest for growth and continue returning capital to shareholders in a disciplined way. Resource allocation the long term profitable growth will remain the highest priority. One of the many reasons I came to Caterpillar was my belief that discipline created by the operating and execution model is the right way to evaluate opportunities and lead us to drive long-term profitable growth.","In addition to profitable growth and capital allocation strategy we will remain focus on sustainable dividend growth and being in the market for share repurchases on a more consistent basis. We expect share repurchases in the fourth quarter to be at least $750 million bringing the total buyback to at least $2.75 billion for the year. As we have said in the past we will be more opportunistic and look to go beyond that depending on market conditions and investment priorities.","Let's move to slide 9. Our profit per share outlook for the year is $10.65 to $11.65 and we are maintaining our second quarter guidance of $11 to $12 per adjusted profit per share. We have not updated the adjusted profit per share outlook range because nothing material has changed since we updated the outlook in July. Since our assumptions have not changed and the third quarter came in above where we expected, we believe it makes sense to maintain that outlook for the full year.","Order rates and the backlog remain healthy with the backlog up almost $2 billion from the third quarter of 2017. Construction industries remains our managed distribution and production rates for large machines and large engines continue to increase with demand. We believe the increase in dealer inventory in the quarter reflects current end user demand and in some regions and in some products was necessary to improve availability to the end customer.","As measured by months of sales dealer inventory ended the quarter at the low end of historical averages. So in short we feel good about the state of our business and with that I will turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A portion of the call.","Amy Campbell","Thank you Andrew. Kate it is now time to began the Q&A portion of the call. Participants should limit their questions to one plus a follow up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Joe O\u2019Dea. Please announce your affiliation. Then pose your question.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Hi good morning. It's Vertical Research. First question Jim your comments across end markets were pretty constructive and encouraging and I think we see kind of a disconnect in where we are seeing a stock reaction to what seems like kind of an outlook right now that would continue to support further growth moving forward. I guess one question just on backlog and seeing that nudge down a little bit sequentially, any commentary across segments and whether or not some of this is lead time related, some of this is just general macro uncertainty but seeing a slight softening there versus what sounds like otherwise pretty strong end market conditions. ","Jim Umpleby","Good Morning Joe. Maybe it makes sense just to spend a few minutes expanding upon how we're doing in each of the markets. We talked about construction industries and that we continue to see very strong demand in Asia-Pacific particularly in China but also in North America in the EAME. Again in energy and transportation very strong activity in onshore gas compression while servicing industry is also strong. We don't see, we haven't experienced a slowdown much has been written about the Permian but we have not experienced a slowdown in our business. It's still been quite strong and people have talked a lot about the fact that there are take away capacity issues and of course whenever pipelines are built that's a good thing for our CI business as well. So again we feel bullish about that business.","Heavy construction and resource industry is continues to be strong. In rail, we've seen an increase in locomotive rebuilds and modernization. We've also seen higher service and part sales. Rail traffic in North America is certainly increased and we've seen a year-over-year reduction the number of ideal locomotives and rail cars.","So we expect new locomotive orders continue to improve. We've seen some business from outside the U.S. as well. We have talked about the fact that that Latin America is a bit slow to recover in construction industries and offshore oil and gas production has been slow, but again we feel good about the state of our business. We feel that the business continues to be strong in most of our end markets and we're not frankly concerned about dealer inventories, backlog and I like Andrew coming on that.","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So I mean obviously we did see the backlog go down by about $400 million in the quarter but remind you that for the year-to-date it is still up nearly $2 billion since the third quarter of last year. At the same time obviously we were building inventory into dealers. We still are at the bottom end of normal ranges. So even though the dealer inventory has gone up over $2 billion since the beginning of the year so that's all indicative of dealers having confidence and obviously the 800 million stock build -- inventory build in the quarter was a lot less than the drop in order backlog. So that does mean that strong demand -- overall dealers are still feeling positive about end consumption.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Thank you. Appreciate those details and then just a follow-up related to price cost and general outlook for price cost moving forward whether or not price cost should actually shift more favorably moving forward, looking at pricing announcements next year into dealers material costs stabilizing and whether we see any kind of improvement on some of the constraints with supply chain and materials and whether all that translates to a little bit more favorable price cost situation moving into the end of the year and then into next year?","Jim Umpleby","On pricing we are starting to see the impact of the mid-year price increase and we expect price realization to more than offset material cost and freight expense for the full year. We recently communicated to our dealers a 1% to 4% price increase that will be effective in January of \u201819. We are working our way through supplying constraints and again we feel good about the environment for pricing just as I mentioned moving forward.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Got it. Thanks very much.","Amy Campbell","Thank you Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Gilardi. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Ross Gilardi","Hey good morning guys Bank of America. Jim, how do we think about the retail numbers that came out on last night? I mean you were up 21% in September but your comp I think goes from being up 13% in September to up 34% by the end of the year in December. So as you exit 2018 are we looking at low to mid single retail -- low to mid single digit retail sales growth is that what's implied at the mid-20 of your guide.","Jim Umpleby","No, I'm not going to make a comment and give you a forecast for retail stats, but I've talked about the end state of our markets and the fact that we feel good about those. Based on everything we see today we expect our business to continue to improve in 2019.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. What's the feedback you're getting from the minors on some of the elevated uncertainty in China I mean are there any RFPs out there they've been put on the back burner until things settle down with the trade situation and what are you seeing on large mining equipment demand from non-China emerging markets as well? Thanks.","Jim Umpleby","Again as I mentioned earlier resource industries business continues to improve. Truck levels are now at the lowest level they've been since 2012. There are still more trucks to bring back online but it's contributing to strong after market demand and we're seeing strong parts demand to support increases in machine utilization. So we certainly feel good about the trajectory of our mining business. Commodities such as copper and gold have been strong. RI's experience growth across all regions. So again we do feel good about RI. Market fundamentals seem to be improving and are quite solid.","Ross Gilardi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steven Fisher. Pleas announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Steven Fisher","Great. Thanks. Good morning at the UBS. I know on China you said you expect the normal seasonal pattern for the rest of 2018 but really curious how you're thinking about China in 2019. It seems like we're heading back in infrastructure stimulus mode there. So do you see any evidence of that having a positive impact on sales or quoting yet and does what they have announced so far in this regard sound being full enough to support ongoing growth in the construction equipment business there for you.","Jim Umpleby","Just a few general comments about China. Certainly it's an important market for us. It averages 5% to 10% of total company sales and revenues and for CI it's about 10% to 15%. There's a lot of different scenarios of course forecasting what's going to happen in China. Based on everything that we see we believe that the China market will continue to be healthy. Excavator demand is up significantly this year after it more than doubled last year and again we feel good about China for next year.","Steven Fisher","Okay and in terms of the resource business how should we think about the margin trajectory there going forward as the original equipment sales continue to pick up and you didn't really call out the margin mix on the margin result this quarter, which came in a little bit lower than our expectation. So has that mix shifts even noticeably started yet and if it does can that be offset by any more advantageous price versus cost?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, I'd urge caution both in particularly in RI and E&T and looking at quarter-to-quarter margins both of those businesses tend to be very lumpy. So we expect quarter-to- quarter variations, in margins up and down and so what we really suggest you look at is our year to your improvement which is what we're really focused on doing. We talked about our targets for margin expectations at Investor Day and we are towards the top end of those or above those. So again we feel good about that as well.","Steven Fisher","But have you seen that impact started yet on the mix shift between O&E and aftermarket or is that still mostly ahead of us?","Jim Umpleby","I would say that in terms of the new equipment we expect that to improve moving forward. So we're certainly seeing activity for new equipment but we expect that to continue to improve. If we step back and think about where we've been from an historical perspective we are still below averages and it's not much as comparing to the peak but we have a long way to go to improve on O&E for mining.","Steven Fisher","Okay so the margin mix might change but you're going to still see bigger dollars ahead it sounds like?","Jim Umpleby","Yes and one of the things also that keep in mind is for next year we have a -- we're going to have a stiff tailwind that's going to have a positive impact in all of our segments as we reset step for next year. That's also out there as well. It's another tailwind to keep in mind.","Steven Fisher","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Jamie Cook","Hi good morning and Andrew welcome to the fun world of industrials. I guess two questions one Andrew for you specifically. Can you just talk about sort of what your top priorities are as CFO of Caterpillar and while Cats answered some questions on sort of share repurchase how you guys are thinking about being more opportunistic on share repurchase given where your stock price is today and perhaps the markets view of what's going on in the macro versus yours and your ability to earn a higher trough EPS and then my second question Amy I'll try you guys sound fairly constructive as we think about \u201819 in terms of volume without specifically stating a number but are there any material positives or negatives we should think about whether it's stock comp, repo or structuring benefits dealer inventories as we think about \u201819 versus \u201818? Thank you.","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So thanks Jamie, and yes it's great to be here and yes it is always exciting to see such a good set of results be put out in front of you guys today. Priorities, I think you shouldn't be surprised obviously the things about making sure that we execute the O&E model particularly well as we move forward. Resource allocation in particular obviously needs to be something we keep a focus on to make sure we drive that profitable growth that we're trying to target and achieve. So working with Jim and the other members of the executive office to do that.","Obviously again you mentioned about capital allocation that is something which again obviously is I know a lot of investor have a lot of focus on obviously we have the $10 billion buyback approved by the board. That will obviously be a key focus as we move forward. Obviously we need to think through how we manage the balance sheet through the cycle and that's something which I will work on and look to as we move forward but obviously as we said and we indicated again we will be opportunistic and go above the $750 million if obviously at times where we think. The share prices below in terms of value which is what it is at the moment.","Jim Umpleby","I will jump in Jamie, taking on the question you had for Amy so on \u201819 obviously it\u2019s [truly] for us to provide a lot of specifics as I mentioned earlier we expect our business to continue to improve in \u201819 versus \u201818 is a lot of puts and takes and we take price realization along with the recent of step and continued cost discipline to offset cost headwinds and we have a healthy backlog, good order rates and we are taking orders for some products well in the 2019. We feel good about state of our business and frankly we expect both the top end and the bottom line to improve in 2019 versus 2018.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Ann Duignan","Yes. Good morning. JP Morgan. My question is around dealer inventories, I know you said you're at the low end of month of supplier based on historical metrics, but historical metrics may not be the right way to look at dealer inventories for Caterpillar because in prior cycles dealers double ordered and order just in case and then we will head the lane strategy, etc, etc. So Jim how do you reassure investors that this cycle is different that your dealers are not double ordering or ordering ahead of price increases or ordering because just in case?","Jim Umpleby","Yes. We've worked very hard over the last couple of years on getting more lean internally and also have looked at our supply chain. Obviously our dealers are independent businesses, so they make their own decisions as to what they do but we do feel based on the strength of the markets that we don't have an issue in terms of dealer inventory. I'll let Andrew jump in here as well.","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. And just like give you a comment I mean I'm actually really impressed by the amount of data that the company actually does have on dealer inventory. You may want to go back to look at my background of Bristol-Myers and why I would be very focused on that because that was a wholesalers in that particular point in time, but I do think a) first of all the visibility is important. Actually in absolute dollar terms they look relatively low versus other parts on the cycle and is something that is very well monitored. So I think as best as it can be but as Jim said because obviously the dealers are independent but it does give us confidence that there isn't any excess inventory built. In fact actually what's happened in the last three months is as we've rent our production effectively we are now getting into a situation where dealers actually have enough inventory that they are able to sell through. So that's an important part of what we've been doing.","Jim Umpleby","What CI still ends on managed distribution that you're probably know and much of the CI increase restocking in China for example is off of very low levels. So again we feel comfortable in what we see.","Ann Duignan","Good. That's helpful and then is there any color you could give us if we look at Europe and the Middle East how much of that region is Middle East and any changes that you're seeing due to political unrest in the Middle East that's currently going on? Is that anything we should be concerned about going into 2019?","Jim Umpleby","At this stage, I mean the bit where we did see some impact in the Middle East area is really around Turkey and that was obviously they've had a fair amount of economic uncertainty. Elsewhere actually through the rest of Europe and most of the rest of the Middle East actually things were pretty much okay. So it's really, really been Turkey been the big driver of uncertainty around that region.","Ann Duignan","Okay I'll pass it on in the interest of time. Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation. Then pose your questions.","Andrew Casey","Thanks a lot. Wells Fargo Securities. If I could go back to Ann's last question there and Amy did you see any moderation in any of the EU countries and then separately can you explain why you think that the weakness and it sounds like it may just be Turkey why do you think that will be contained?","Jim Umpleby","Well, firstly I mean obviously Turkey has been obviously going through a fair amount of economic uncertainty, obviously with U.S. sanctions as well being applied that has had some impact on the broader economy in Turkey. I think will sort I hopefully seeing that moderate now as we move forward and hopefully start seeing Turkey recover. Around the rest of Europe if you look around the rest I mean UK sales were sort of flattish in the quarter as will be expected with uncertainties there but generally actually the rest of EAME actually work was pretty good and Europe was actually pretty strong as well.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thank you and then I just wanted to confirm something. So we've had several quarters where construction remains on managed distribution. Can you comment on whether the constraints you may be still encountering are part of Cat's internal suppliers or is it mainly external and really what I'm trying to get to is if there's any change in past comments about CapEx remaining beneath depreciation?","Jim Umpleby","Andy there is no changes. So construction industries has plenty of bricks and mortar capacity to meet demand and the issue has been with suppliers and as I'm sure you know it isn't just Cat and our competitors but manufacturers in many different industries have struggled with just the general increase in economic activity and what that's driven in terms of demand. So, no it's not, it\u2019s not internal and you shouldn't take anything away from a capital investment perspective based on that.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","David Raso","Evercore ISI. Good morning. Basically I'm just trying to figure out the confident comments that you seem to be having about 2019 that you've made, [indiscernible] why we still have a dollar EPS range in the fourth quarter, just trying to understand. You obviously seem fairly comfortable in your production schedules moving forward. If I heard you correctly it seems like the fourth quarter sequential versus third quarter you would expect some normal seasonal patterns in your sales, like it's maybe first if you can confirm that because the dollar range in the fourth quarter, I appreciate the comment nothing's changed since our prior view so we just figure we maintain it but it does at least raise the question your confidence in \u201819 to leave a dollar range for the fourth quarter is interesting. So I guess first can you confirm that you expect normal sequential sales patterns third to fourth?","Jim Umpleby","So David let me be as clear as I can be obviously yes we do expect normal seasonal sales sequential patterns in the fourth quarter. If you look at our margin structure for the year, year-to-date it's 16.6%. In the third quarter it was 16.6%. We expect margins to be broadly similar as well so that very much is, very much in line with where we've been expecting. I think on the range I think changing the range would have sent some [miss sort of] message about something had changed since July. We were very clear in our thought process that we actually just wanted to be very clear to you all and say nothing's changed. Expectations of outlook have not changed and so we just wanted to reflect that through the guidance. Yes, it is a wide range, yes but we expect nothing really much has changed since where we were in July. So narrowing it may have created some noise either at the bottom end or at the top end. So we just thought it'd be better to leave it as is and explain it on the call today.","David Raso","No, I appreciate that I'm just trying to think of a launching pad into \u201819 because if your sales are up their normal 6% to 7% sequentially third or fourth and the margins are the same that means the fourth quarter EPS is above the third quarter and your guidance implies it's not. So I'm just trying to understand is that comfortable because the numbers don't fully back it up and you're just saying it's still within the range it might get to the high end of the range but you decided to keep it as a wide range?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, I mean if you do the math says you've done it then you would see the quarters being up. I think that our view is the range is wide, yes we don't expect to be at the bottom end of the range. So I think that's based on what we're expecting we expect the normal sales pattern and operating margins to be broadly in line with where they've been all year.","David Raso","And lastly on the price increases announced to start 2019, the impact of those can you help us a little bit I mean if there seem to be [they're not price] protected shipments. So I'm trying to get a sense of the price cost as we start 2019. Can you help us a little bit with that on the timing of the cost versus the timing the price as we start \u201819 for a run rate? ","Jim Umpleby","Yes. I mean I think we are obviously we did get quite a long lead time partly so that we can actually put it into effect. We expect a significant proportion. A majority of that portion to stick obviously into 2019 but obviously when we're doing as sort of initial guidance for next year we're taking to account that not all of that will be fully realized in the 2019 time frame. So will give you a bit more an updating a bit more color then and also don't forget we will have the full-year benefit of the mid-year price increase in 2019 as well.","David Raso","Double stack to start the year? Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Jerry Revich","Good morning everyone. It's Goldman Sachs. Can you talk about the M&A pipeline and the relative attractiveness of M&A versus buyback to you folks at this point you mentioned stocks below the intrinsic value but how does that stack up versus your M&A options and as you folks look at the balance sheet today the cleanest has been in over 30 years, what do you think is the right level of leverage for this business longer term?","Jim Umpleby","Yes. This is Jim. I will start it off and let Andrew jump in at the end if you would like but you mentioned M&A and buybacks well the other thing we can also do is invest in organic growth which we are very much doing. So all of our businesses continuously evaluate M&A opportunities. We're continuing to do that. We're not excluding anything. We are not saying that there's a definitive plan for a big M&A either. We are very focused on organic growth particularly in areas of services in digital. We're increasing our capability there and now I will let Andrew take the buyback question.","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. Jerry on the sort of what's the right level of leverage on some [weeks], so I think if you would excuse me to start betting that out for a little bit longer because actually it's one of the things I want to work through and work through how do we think about this through the cycle which is what we do have to do. We do want to maintain the mid-year rating through the cycle. So we have to think through that how that capital allocation works. Obviously at the moment we do have more cash than we inherently need so therefore we are as we've seen accelerating the buyback program and that is obviously the key at the moment.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you and you, folks give us color on new dealer inventories of new equipment. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on the use equipment side I guess we're seeing used inventories inching up in North America construction equipment. Are you seeing that as well? Can you just talk about your comfort level on the use side?","Amy Campbell","Yes Jerry I think if you look at used equipment the inventories are quite tight and we're seeing increases and used equipment prices continue.","Jerry Revich","Any color by region Amy?","Amy Campbell","I don't have any specific color by region. It's certainly the case in North America where I have most of that data.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Stephen Volkmann","Hi, good morning. It's Jefferies. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple quick follow-ups. Just back to the resource if we actually do sell more equipment next year than parts can you still have up margin? ","Jim Umpleby","Yes. I'm not sure we said we'd sell more equipment than part. I think what we said is that term on mining the resource industries correct.","Stephen Volkmann","Yes. Thank you. That's the question.","Jim Umpleby","Yes. So both are improving. So our parts sales are increasing as our opportunities for our new equipment as well. So I'm not going to make a -- we're leveraging obviously leveraging period cost where we're seeing higher volume and that's a good thing. So I'm not going to make any comment on margins new versus parts.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you and then just a couple quick ones on tariffs I know you've been managing that quite well so far. What happens when and if it looks like more than if sorry when the tariffs go to 25% on the section 301. What type of impact would that have and then are you either doing or seeing from your customers any kind of pre-buy activity around that whole issue?","Jim Umpleby","So we previously stated that our \u2013 we would in the last six months of the year we have cost headwinds of $100 million to $200 million we're going to be at the lower end of that range we believe. We haven't seen a big pre-buy but of course we're in a situation where we've had some constraints and so we've been on managed distribution. So we don't expect a major impact as quite frankly we were already hit with the earlier tariffs so we don't think a later change will have an impact on us. It was already baked in for us.","Stephen Volkmann","And are you buying any parts ahead of changes in pricing?","Jim Umpleby","Well, again we're in a situation where as we talked earlier there's a supply constraint challenge not only for Caterpillar, our competitors but for many other manufacturers as well. So I don't think anyone has honestly has the luxury of making a lot of big pre-buys. So no.","Stephen Volkmann","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Rob Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Rob Wertheimer","Thanks. It's Melius Research. And thank you for the prior answer, if I could just get a little bit more specific on it, I mean obviously tariffs are remaining big uncertainty for the market and estimates. Is it what you just said is that meant to suggest that if there is 25% on the additional $200 billion of goods tariffs that that would be at or smaller than the impact you've had this year? We just sort can't see all the different things you and your suppliers buy. So obviously you've got a lot more information on quantifying that than we do.","Jim Umpleby","Yes. The impact would be quite minor in the bigger scheme of things for Cat's results.","Rob Wertheimer","Okay. Perfect. Are you doing any materials for the production mitigation where you produce more in Brazil or elsewhere to offset that or is it just straight minor on a gross basis like the stuff that's tariffs isn't as large in the second round for you?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, we're not making a lot of production shifts. I mean our teams obviously continuously monitor the situation and it can with politics to get together the situation can change dramatically day to day. So we \u2013 we have not made production shift decisions based on this.","Rob Wertheimer","Great. Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","But just expand upon that we have a global footprint, so we have the luxury of unlike some other companies, we manufacture products in Asia, in the Americas, in EAME so that does help us mitigate this somewhat because we do have a global manufacturing base.","Rob Wertheimer","Perfect. Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Sameer Rathod, please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Sameer Rathod","Macquarie Research. Thank you for taking my question. Just one quick question on labor cost. It seems like there's growing political pressure for $15 per hour and we've seen some response to that already. Can you quantify how much of an impact if any it would be a cost in terms of Cat, if Cat paid at least $15 an hour to its manufacturing staff? Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","Yes. For the most part it's not going to have an impact on us and we are above $15 in the vast majority of places are only in the U.S. so I don't see an impact on us.","Sameer Rathod","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joel Tiss. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Joel Tiss","Hi, Bank of Montreal and so just two quick ones. You guys are running now near the top end of your investor day margins and I just wondered if there's more kind of like leaning toward raising those targets or are we kind of passing the maximum point of the internal efficiencies and you're more comfortable just leaving them in place?","Jim Umpleby","So as we as we talked about we're focused on growing our business as well, so while our teams are continuously focused on making our operations more efficient, we're also investing for growth. So it's \u2013 there's always a balance there between those margins and growth but we're pleased that we are ahead of where we said we would be from a time perspective and our team has a laser focus on those margins but again there's a balance between investing for growth. We just don't want to continue to bring out higher margins every year at the expense of growth. However, right if we can both grow and have higher margins then that's fine as well. So again it's a balance.","Joel Tiss","Okay.","Jim Umpleby","Volumes, sorry so one comment I mean if certainly if volumes go up, obviously that gives us an opportunity to have higher margins because we're leveraging that overhead across the higher volume. So that opportunity certainly exists.","Joel Tiss","And then Andrew there there's always been kind of this historic inside a Cat a push and pull between growing market share and having more pins in the map and profitability and I just wondered based on your experience and history and all that if you what would be your initial input into that debate?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. I think let me just say the history is littered and of companies who have either gone for market share the expensive margins and\/or then gone for margins at the expense of market share, ultimately at the end of the day we want to do both and it's all about trying to do profitable growth. I think that is really one of the reasons why I joined, I love the term profitable growth and the fact that it does mean that you actually have to do focus not just on growth and profits but actually sustainable long term profitable growth. So ultimately at the end of the day you want to do both is the simple answer.","Joel Tiss","Okay, I appreciate you guys squeezing me in thank you.","Amy Campbell","And Kate we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chad Dillard. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Chad Dillard","Good morning everyone from Deutsche Bank. So I just want to go back to the $800 million increase in dealer inventory. Can you give a little bit more detail by [segments] region where the entries came from and then where do you expect that to exit 2018?","Jim Umpleby","Yes. I mean I'm not going to break down 800 million for you by region but as we said one of the biggest areas where it was in China and as a result of the selling season second quarter there was a very strong pull in in China. Overall across all the segments we are comfortable that we still remain at the low end of the range and then obviously as with the production ramp ups we are starting to get to a situation where dealers have adequate inventory on hand. So again I think rather than get into the sort of then having to give you an update exactly where the inventory is, the inventory is across all the segments. It was build across all segments in the quarter but generally we are comfortable with where we've ended.","Chad Dillard","That's helpful and then just switching over to the price you mentioned a 1% to 4% increase, I mean 2019, how does it break down across your various segments and then also the thing that jumped out at me was a 4% price increase in resource industries and I was just curious whether it's more like a mix issue or are you actually getting price on apples to apples basis and if so it has a market tight enough so that that's sustainable?","Jim Umpleby","Yes. So at this again the price realization in RI is a lot due to mix and versus a prior year with regards to the 1% to 4% we're not going to break it down by segments but basically it depends geographically and it depends on business segment as to what the price increases were put through.","Chad Dillard","Great. Thank you very much.","Amy Campbell","Kate, that's going to be our last question. Jim do you have a couple of wrap-up comments.","Jim Umpleby","We just thanks everyone for your time this morning. I just wanted to end by saying I'm very, very proud of the Caterpillar global team for a record profit per share for the third consecutive quarter and we continue to deliver record quarterly profits even while many of our end markets are still in their early stages of recovery. We'll continue a relentless execution of our strategy, supporting our customer success, very focused on profitable growth and total shareholder return. Look forward to speaking to all next quarter.

At this time, all lines have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Mike DeWalt","Thank you very much and good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I am Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations. And on the call today, I am pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; Group President and CFO Ed Rapp and Brad Halverson, who will be replacing Ed as Group President and CFO in January as Ed is transitioning over to be the Group President heading our Construction Industry\u2019s business.","This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you would like a copy of today\u2019s call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website, and it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","This morning there is no doubt, we\u2019re going to be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1-A, Risk Factors, of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC back on February 21 of 2012, and it\u2019s also in the forward-looking statements language contained in today\u2019s release.","In addition, we have a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures and that can be found in today\u2019s financial release which has also been posted on our website at cat.com.","Okay. I\u2019ll start this morning with a few top points that summarize this morning\u2019s release. First, we reported a good third quarter. In fact it was the highest sales and highest profit of any third quarter in our history. Sales and revenues were a little over $16.4 billion, an increase of about 5% from the third quarter of 2011. Profit in the quarter was $2.54 a share and that ties the second quarter of this year for the all-time record. Profit was helped in the quarter though by a pretax gain of $273 million on the sale of a majority interest in our third-party logistics business and that happened in the third quarter.","Now, incremental operating profit pull-through was extremely high in the quarter and that was okay if whether or not you adjust the logistics gain. That said the sales increase in the quarter I think was small enough; the incremental margin in a quarter like this is probably not that useful a metric. However, there has been enough of the sales increase I think year-to-date forward to be a more useful metric and year-to-date it\u2019s been over 30% and that\u2019s an indication of good cost control and execution on part of the company.","Now, while we reported a good third quarter, we did lower the full year outlook for 2012 and we provided preliminary sales and revenue guidance for 2013 and I\u2019ll cover both of those in a couple of minutes, but first a little more color on the quarter. And again, let\u2019s start with sales and revenues, up $729 million or about 5% from third quarter of last year. Now, when we look at sales, there are three perspectives that we take. The first perspective is by reason, in other words, was it changed due to volume, price, currency, acquisitions and alike. And from that perspective, sales volume improved $622 million, price realization was favorable $305 million, acquisitions and divestitures and we actually had both, it was a net positive of $36 million and financial products revenues were up $13 million.","Currency was negative on sales and it partially offset the increase by about $247 million, and that\u2019s largely because the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and Brazilian Real than in the third quarter a year ago. The improvement in price realization at $305 million is lower than we reported in the second quarter, but it\u2019s held up pretty well this year and it\u2019s been higher than we have expected most of the year.","The next where we look at are views, the sales changes by geographic region. And from that perspective, North America was up 9% in the quarter. Sales in Asia-Pacific rose 8% and EAME, which is Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin American sales, were about flat. The increase in North America was primarily driven by higher sales of construction equipment in the United States, which has been a relative bright spot all year. With expectations around U.S. housing on demand we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about construction sales in the U.S. going forward. I said a minute ago that it was a relative bright spot and that's because although it\u2019s still improving, it\u2019s still well below the prior peak.","Within Asia-Pacific, it\u2019s a little bit of a different story. Sales are up in the region overall, despite lower construction equipment sales in China and that\u2019s because mining and power system sales have been up throughout the region. And Latin America was about flat and so was EAME, and while EAME was flat overall, Europe was modestly lower and Africa and Middle East and the CIS moderately higher.","The third way that we look at sales is by segment and this quarter most of our sales increase was in the Resource Industries segment, which is mostly mining and that was up 13% from the third quarter last year. Power Systems was up 5% and most of that increase was related to the acquisition of MWM and then Construction Industry sales were about flat in the quarter. ","Financial products revenues were up by about 3% and our all other segment was actually down 31% and most of that was a result of the sale of our third-party logistics business.","All right, let\u2019s shift to third quarter profits, which at $2.54 was a tie for the highest quarter ever. Operating margin was 15.8% of sales and revenues and if you exclude the logistics gain, it was 14.1%.","Cost control was good, material costs were actually slightly favorable in the quarter and variable labor productivities held up pretty well this year. When comparing profit to the third quarter of 2011, acquisition impacts had a pretty significant impact on operating margin and that\u2019s mostly two things. ","The logistics gain was a plus in the third quarter of this year and then last year, we had a lot of the upfront Bucyrus related cost related to that acquisition in the third quarter of last year.","So it's less of that from last year and the logistics gain this year. On the negative side, we had higher taxes all year long. Our estimated annual tax rate for this year is 30.5%, that\u2019s higher than the third quarter of last year and it's higher than the full year of 2011. ","And that\u2019s really because of two things. One is the absence of the R&D tax credit that Congress has not yet renewed and geographic mix change in terms of where our profits are. ","Okay, that\u2019s a quick review of the third quarter. Let\u2019s move on to the 2012 outlook. In this morning\u2019s release, we did lower the outlook for both sales and profit. We\u2019re expecting 2012 sales and revenues of about $66 billion and profit in a range of $9 to $9.25 a share, that\u2019s down from the previous outlook range on the top line of $68 billion to $70 billion and profit at $9.60 a share at the middle of the sales range.","Now, at MINExpo about a month ago, we said we were in the middle of our forecasting process and it was evident that sales estimates were going to come down. Since then, we have completed the forecast and we have another month of actual results under our belt. And the sales outlook is down from July for two primary reasons. ","First, end user demand, while better than a year ago is not growing as fast as we were expecting it would. From a product standpoint, it\u2019s fairly widespread across construction, mining and Power Systems. And from a geographic standpoint, it\u2019s also spread across the globe. ","The second reason for our decline today in the sales outlook is dealer inventory. Based on the finished inventory that we have significant improvements we\u2019ve made in delivery times to dealers and some moderating growth in end user demand, our dealers find themselves with too much inventory. ","In response, they\u2019ve cut order rates to levels that are well below what they\u2019re selling to end customers. As a result, in the fourth quarter we\u2019ll be reducing production levels quite a bit, we\u2019ve already announced a number of temporary plant shutdowns and there\u2019ll be more coming. It means that for the next quarter and into 2013 our production will be below end user demand. ","By segment about two-thirds of the outlook decline is construction and the other third is split about evenly between mining and Power Systems. Based on our new outlook of $66 billion of sales and revenues this year, the fourth quarter will be just slightly below the third quarter of this year.","Now if you look at the decline in our profit outlook range of $9 to $9.25 range, it is primarily result of the lower sales, but partially offset by the gain on our third-party logistics business which happened in the third quarter. ","Now in addition to 2012 and as we usually do at this time of the year, we have provided the preliminary economic and sales outlook for 2013. You can boil down what we are thinking about 2013 to a short statement and that goes both for economic environment and sales and that statement is that here she goes not much change from 2012.","Now as we look forward on the positive side in many countries around the world, monetary and credit policies have eased over the past year and we do expect that to continue into 2013. ","However, economic growth has been slow to respond and we are not expecting any improvement in world economic growth until may be the second half of 2013. And even then for the full year, we are only expecting economic growth for the world of about 2.7% and that\u2019s just a couple of tens of a point above what we are expecting for this year. ","In the developed world, we continue to expect growth at levels that are well below potential at about 1.5% in total for the developed world with about 2% growth in the US and the Eurozone close to zero. ","In the developing world, we are expecting growth of about 5.5% that\u2019s about half a point better than 2012. We think Brazil will continue to improve some and the China\u2019s growth rates will improve to about 8.5%.","Again to summarize of our view of the 2013 economic prospects, we\u2019re not expecting much change from this year. We are not timed for a significant pickup in the world economy, but that said, we are also not expecting a recession. We are expecting a continuation of the slow growth path the world seems to be on. And now I will just repeat that for emphasis, we are seeing, expecting or reflecting the world being in recession in our outlook for 2013.","And based on our study as she goes slow growth economic outlook, we are expecting 2013 sales and revenues to be roughly the same as 2012 and a band of about plus to minus 5%. We are expecting our resource industry segment which is primarily mining to be down somewhat in 2013.","Lower metals and coals prices and the increasing operating cost have hurt the profit margins at many mining companies. That profit pressure combined was economic uncertainty and slow growth has resulted in mining companies delaying some investment. ","Although, metals prices have recently improved, we expect mining companies will reduce capital spending in 2013 and sales of mining equipment will decline.","However, we expect the lower mining sales to be about offset by higher sales of construction equipment. We are expecting some improvement in construction activity in the United States and you are already seeing some of that in housing. Sales of construction equipment in China should also improve somewhat in 2013 after quite significant declines in 2012. Now to be clear, we're not expecting China to make up the ground that was lost in 2012, but we do expect some modest improvement from a very disappointing 2012.","We are seeing Brazil continue to improve and expect that construction equipment sales in the developing world in general will be a little better in \u201913 than 2012.","On the downside in construction, we are not expecting economy recovery in Europe and are planning sales there to be lower.","For our third large segment, Power Systems, we're expecting sales to be roughly flat with 2012.","In terms of timing, how we're thinking about sales first half versus second half. We\u2019re not expecting a major economic pickup in the year and we're not expecting a big demand pick up next year. But, we and our dealers will be continuing to work off inventory early in the year, which will probably cause early sales in 2013 to be a little bit weaker than the usual seasonality.","I am going to finish here this morning with the three main points we're trying to get across today in this call and in this morning in our release. Point number one is, we're doing a very good job of managing costs, margins are good and incremental margins so far in 2012 have been much better than our goal of 25%.","Point two, we recognize we have too much inventory and dealers are telling us they have too much inventory. As a result, we\u2019re lowering production. We've already announced widespread temporary layoffs and rolling factory shutdowns or temporary shutdowns and there is more coming. It will take a little while to work down the inventory and that means that our production levels and sales will be lower than dealer sales to end users in the fourth quarter and into 2013.","The third and final key point that we\u2019re making today is we\u2019re taking a pragmatic steady-as-you-go view of 2013. We\u2019re not saying or predicting a worldwide recession, but if one happens we know what to do. And as I mentioned a minute ago, we\u2019re already taking actions to lower production to deal with the inventory and we\u2019re ready to do more if we need to.","On the flip side of that and this is also an important point, we\u2019re not banking on a big tick-up in the economy and if we get a better economy next year, that\u2019s upside of the outlook.","So that\u2019s it. So, we\u2019re ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Eli Lustgarten. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Longbow Securities, good morning everyone. Can we get a little more into the production cuts and the timing of it, at MINExpo you told us you were basically taking $2 billion out of the fourth quarter, it looks like you took a little bit third and now gave us a little bit distribution. Can you give us some quantification of how much production are you taking out this year and how much will go into next year, so we can get a sense of the size of magnitude of what\u2019s going on?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. When we were at MINExpo we weren\u2019t done with the forecast, because at that it was pretty clear that it was going to come down. Order rates for both mining and construction were lower. For mining, it\u2019s been evident that customers wanted to lower CapEx next year and we were seeing that in our orders and it was becoming pretty clear despite decent sales to end users that dealers were reducing orders to cut inventory in the third and fourth quarter. At MINExpo the sum of all of that looked around $2 billion; it ended up being more like $3 billion and that\u2019s the change that we have in the outlook. So directionally, we were pretty; I mean we knew which direction it was going to go. We can see what was happening, we have another month under our belt, it\u2019s going to be this year and there will probably be some reduction in the first quarter as well.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","So that $3 billion is what you schedule for this year and somewhere on top of that or the $3 billion will spillover?","Mike DeWalt","","Well, I wouldn\u2019t view the $3 billion as entirely inventory reduction; I think this $3 billion is a combination of inventory reduction and demand is not as high as we thought. Just in general, if you look at sales to end users still positive versus year ago and along those lines I would mention that the September number was a little weaker than you might have expected and that\u2019s because we have an extra weekend in September. We\u2019ll have more workdays in October, so workdays were about 10% less than September. But the point is, even though sales to end users are up versus a year ago, well in positive territory, our expectation is that it was actually going to be a bit better than it\u2019s turning out in the fourth quarter. So the decline in the outlook is both inventory and increases in demand are a little less than we thought.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","And a follow-up, can you talk about mining being down next year; can you just give some kind of quantification whether that's double digit or single digit or some magnitude of how we should think about impact on the mining sector?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, I\u2019ll tell you what, we don't the guidance by segment, but if you were to look broadly at generally what mining companies are saying about CapEx, I think the numbers that I have seen are sort of 5% to 10% and I\u2019ll give you some over the magnitude in the overall terms of what they are thinking.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vance Edelson. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Hi, Morgan Stanley, good morning. A follow-up on that last question, with the mining customers delaying some projects and reducing orders, could you give us your feel for just how widespread this has already become; in other words do you have some customers that are taking the early steps perhaps they are acting quite concerned, while others are still taking more of a wait-and-see approach or have the vast majority started to delay already?","Mike DeWalt","Vance, it\u2019s actually been going on some slight in the second quarter; it hasn't really changed too all for much here in the last month or two, it\u2019s a pattern that\u2019s continued. I think basically what happened is mining companies actually have quite a bit in the order book already, we have particularly for the long lead time mining products, like large mining trucks, we have pretty good order cover for next year and I think they are just taking a wait-and-see attitude to see what happens here with China and the U.S. elections and to get some direction on next year before they start ordering again.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Okay, that's helpful. And then in the past, you have referred to a potential inflection point in China. Any update on when you might see that happening; does the first quarter of 2013 now seem too early given the backend weighted overall expectations that you have for next year?","Mike DeWalt","Well, actually China has continued to be pretty weak. In fact, I would say that\u2019s one of the reasons why our finished inventory hasn\u2019t come down. Maybe a little bit faster. You know, we were thinking we would start seeing at least a little bit of a pick up here in the fourth quarter. Within the economy there, they are going to accelerate some infrastructure spend. Now they have taken monetary policy easing sentiment on the ground from the dealers is a bit better but in terms of translating it into sales, I would say hasn\u2019t happened yet. So the selling season is, sort of mid-February on. So, probably not going to see much till then.","Doug Oberhelman","","Mike let me add in here. It\u2019s Doug Oberhelman. I want to just add on China little bit. Mike is exactly right. We don\u2019t see anything concrete differently today than we have over the last few months. However, we were just there two weeks ago. All of us with our Board of Directors were October meeting. We met with all of our distributors in China and most of them in Asia and I would say for the first time that I\u2019ve talked to them in a while.","As Mike said, the attitude is better and their outlook is better without concrete orders in hand however. We heard, I would say, story after story of positive anecdotes from their customers inside China but none of them yet are on the order books that the presidential transition or the leadership transition happens in the first half of November. Unanimously, they all believe that\u2019s a water shedder that we all know that.","They also look for substantial change whatever that means by Chinese New Year which typically is a selling season over there anyway. But, these are anecdotes at this point, but I would note that it\u2019s the first positive anecdotes we\u2019ve had across the board inside China in some time. So, we all are somewhat encouraged without any concrete things to put it in our pocketbook as yet.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","And from the Chinese officials themselves, are you hearing anything either directly or indirectly in terms of what they might focus on to the extent they try to spur growth, do you think infrastructure for example, or anything else that you could benefit from is going to be high on that list?","Doug Oberhelman","Well, they\u2019ve had the easing spec at open or almost all year, we\u2019ve seen increased levels of building permitting this year over last year. We\u2019ve also seen in the last six weeks or so a major infrastructure effort announced. I suspect all of that is aimed after presidential or leadership transition and most of that\u2019s aimed towards spring of next year which is kind of a confluence of events that around Chinese New Year but half of this is going to happen and if it doesn\u2019t we\u2019re in for another kind of slow year in 2013. But right now, the hand, the cards in the hand are looking better than they have for a while. But not, I would emphasize, nothing concrete in terms of orders as yet.","Mike DeWalt","As he said, the only thing I would add to that in terms of the government officials is I think it\u2019s quite clear from the discussions as they\u2019re trying to moderate the stimulus maybe more effectively than they did back in the \u201908, \u201909 timeframe where they felt things really got overheated. And we look at that as a positive, but there will be a point in time when we look back on 2012 and I think, we\u2019ll be pleased with the fact that China slowed and put this thing under more control. I guess it\u2019s going to be better for our business, better for our business model over the long pull.","","Operator","","Our next question today is coming from Steve Volkmann. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies & Company","","I am wondering Mike, can you share, you gave us some data regarding your backlog and I am wondering if you could share your book-to-bill in mining specifically?","","Mike DeWalt","","Well, we don\u2019t, we have never disclosed that, we put out a backlog for the total company. We don\u2019t even; we are not even splitting that by segments. What I would tell you though is the decline in the backlog occurred in all three major segments I mean it wasn\u2019t all mining; it was a combination of mining, construction and Power Systems. And again most would have been construction and Power Systems and its mining companies are taking delivery certainly on products that they have ordered, in fact our sales of mining equipment in the third quarter for Resource Industries were up 13% from a year ago. But they are not ordering much. Again, I think they are taking a wait and see. They have CapEx expectations next year that are a little bit lower than this year.","So we are seeing that in the backlog. For construction, it\u2019s a little more about I think the short-term issue. I mean with construction it\u2019s not long lead time product, no dealers try to keep on hand or have orders that are let\u2019s just say in the ballpark of delivery times from us so kind of a few month sales. It\u2019s been orders on construction have been quite low over the past few months, actually improving a little bit as we have gone through. Well below their sales to end users the order rate.","So what that means is as those orders over the last quarter kind of move into our production schedules for the fourth quarter and the first quarter. It means that there should be fairly significant reductions in the inventory. And then again I think that's a temporary situation. Dealers can't go on for very long time selling or ordering less than they are selling. We\u2019ll see that for probably a couple of quarters, but then it has to move backup in line with selling rates.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies & Company","Okay, that's helpful. I guess where I was trying to get out tough as to think about the mix shift, as we get into 2013. Are you seeing any cancellations, I know you let that, you allowed that at one point in a previous downturn, is it that aftermarket is kind of holding in okay of that, the [OE] side is weaker or is it more broad?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, I think the [OE] side is where, I mean order rates are dropped, I mean for parts we are shipping about 24 hours. So our order backlog for parts is usually limited to about a day. So it that doesn't really play much into the order backlog numbers. The decline would definitely be OE and again, we know we have pretty good visibility in the backlog. We not had massive cancellations but, I wouldn\u2019t say, we haven't had any, but the primary reason, the backlog is come down as they have just eased off ordering. I think it\u2019s only to get a better picture for what next year is going to look like.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Ted Grace. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group","The first thing I was hoping to ask you is on the 2013 revenue guidance. Could you just, may be clarify, is that a top down perspective or is that bottoms up, having gone through their business segments dealer conversations and all the other things that would drive the bottoms up forecast?","Mike DeWalt","It\u2019s a little above. I mean, we do from the top down, we do an economic forecast. We try to translate that into what we think that means, region-by-region sort of product-by-product category around the world. And then we play in to that from a bottoms-up standpoint. The uniqueness that\u2019s going on in individual products, you have new products or you\u2019re having a particular push into a region, do dealers have unique things going on in the territory. So it's a little bit of a combination. It's kind of a top down in economic view coupled with bottoms-up view of the territories and the products and the product dynamics. So it's a little bit of both.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. So just and I realized you haven\u2019t given any kind of formal guidance on or any guidance whatsoever for earnings for next year, but just a little hand holding to think about the key variables; you did walked through sales mix next year and obviously mining you mentioned would be down, which all equals the headwind and you mentioned some of the production issues. But when we think through the key levers of variables, could you just give us maybe some framework of how to think about mix next year and puts and takes?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, I can do a little bit of that. Under the kind of qualification that we [haven\u2019t] really provided profit guidance and to a large degree, we're still working on the details of next year\u2019s plan. But certainly, one of the things for sure you would have to take into consideration is in the third quarter of this year we had the third-party logistics sale gain. That was $273 million pretax in the third quarter. We're not going to sell that thing twice. So that will definitely come out.","Sales mix, as you mentioned, that would lot likely be a little bit negative. We have some decline in mining next year, some increase in construction. We\u2019ll make a little more money in mining and we\u2019ll do construction. So to your point, that would not signal a positive sales mix.","We\u2019ve been investing for the future and our CapEx has been a little up, probably a little bit less than $4 billion this year. So that means the depreciation next year will be a little bit higher. Kind of the flipside of that though is we\u2019ve done a pretty good job on managing the factories; we\u2019ve held our fixed cost growth, so I think in terms of managing costs we\u2019ve done a good job, efficiency in the factories, all-in is held up pretty well, we do have some pricing next year, we announced, not huge, but some price increase for next year that would certainly be positive.","I think those are probably some of the bigger things to think about. I guess the last point that I would make, is that this year even with what we\u2019re expecting to take out in inventory in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll still end up this year with an inventory increase and we would certainly be planning on inventory decrease next year. Order magnitude, we\u2019re still working on, and that will likely be a little bit negative for profit as well.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group","So the last thing I\u2019ll ask Mike is, just the guidance for 2013 revenue. Could you give us a sense of how to think about what the embedded dealer inventory levels would be either year-on-year or versus normal ratios of inventory and sales?","Mike DeWalt","You mean how it would end next or just\u2026\u2026..","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group","Yeah, either where it would end or how we should think about that pattern next year or path?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, I think it depends a little bit on how next year plays out. Dealer inventory, by and large they\u2019ll have somewhere in the, by historic standards around 3.25 months to 3.50 months of inventory. So it will really depend upon what sales are looking like towards the end of next year in terms of how much they will have.","But I think if you look at selling rates today they have more than that, a pretty good size, a chunk of what we took out of not all of it certainly, some of that will come from our inventory, but we would expect to make pretty good reductions in dealer inventory in the fourth quarter, probably again in first quarter, but may be a little bit less than the fourth quarter, not because they don\u2019t have more to do, but because commonly in the first quarter dealers build inventory for the selling season.","So I think the specifics of how it\u2019s going to play out by quarter will probably depend on next year and how confident dealers get in the second quarter, but certainly down $ 1 billion or $2 billion from where they are at now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andy Casey. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Wells Fargo Securities. Good morning, everybody. A couple of questions, but first on CAT corporate cash flow, inventory liquidation benefit from the inventory cut that you kind of forecast. How much of that is coming from purchase material and work-in-process or are you considering rolling back some of the PDC inventory?","Mike DeWalt","","Well it\u2019s actually a little above, in fact if you look at the purchase content and our work-in-process and raw material inventory, we actually took that down several hundred million dollars in the third quarter. So in fact in the cash flow for the third quarter, payables were a little bit less of a help and partly that's because we\u2019ve cut the front end of that inventory pipeline. I think if you look at what will happen in the fourth quarter, it will probably less work-in-process and production stores in a bit more of the finished goods as we try to take that down.","Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thanks Mike. And then if I can go back to the topic of the day that mining equipment CapEx cycle, last month you discussed the longer-term extension of the current mining investment cycle. And then today although short-term, you are talking about the 2013 backlog for orders from your customers are pretty full and you acknowledged 2013 CapEx may decline from 2012.","I am just trying to understand kind of where we are in the potential cycle and whether if nothing changes in 2013 in the macro environment do all the puts and take suggests that in 2013 you would see accelerating declines through the year or is it just kind of, like you said in the overall revenue mix down first half up, second half?","Mike DeWalt","Before I answer the point on mining, this whole first half second half thing, I would just like to clarify, just a little bit. We are not looking for a Hail Mary second half of the year; that is a big increase after a decrease in the first half; that is not what we were predicting, we are not out there expecting a big economic recovery in the second half; it\u2019s going to somehow save the year from a weak first half.","I think what we\u2019re saying is it\u2019s going to be bit of a whole probably is not the right word but a pretty stable year. Our sales will probably be a little bit lower in the first half relative to the normal seasonality just because we're still working on dealer inventory. So I think it's worth noting that we're not backing on a giant second half of the year to somehow bail the year out. I think with regard to mining in general, I would say we couldn't be more positive about the long-term potential for mining. I mean the world\u2019s population is continuing to go up, more and more people are moving into the middle class as standard of livings improve. Those are big commodity drivers. I think long-term we're very comfortable with mining.","In the short-term, there are economic swings. The developed world particularly China are big incremental users of [Technical Difficulty] commodities. In 2012, their growth rates tipped down and it's been negative at least for a while to commodity prices. It's given miners an opportunity to take a breather. And that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s a normal economic situation that happens. That doesn\u2019t I don't think change the longer-term view of mining which in our view is actually quite positive. So, I think that next year should be a fairly steady as she goes year overall, but with us probably selling a little less in the first half of the year because we know dealers are cutting inventory. I don't know if that answered it but. ","Doug Oberhelman","I just want to talk a little bit. It\u2019s Doug Oberhelman here. A little bit about my view of \u201912 and \u201913 and \u201911 for that matter but 2012 for this company will be a record year at top line and bottom line. And what we\u2019re looking at is [Technical Difficulty] the growth between here and \u201815, so maybe that\u2019s a little more long-term perspective on it but, certainly how I see that at this stage today.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Timothy Thein. Please announce your affiliation, and then pose your question.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup","First question just, Mike to come back on segment mix, specifically on Power Systems, there is obviously a couple of different segments within there where the margins and returns can vary quite a bit, but given your, the outlook in the release on your expectations for brand averaging $110 a barrel next year would seem to be supportive for E&P spending, and obviously petroleum. So can you maybe provide a little bit more color in terms of how you\u2019re currently thinking about mix within that, the Power Systems number for 2013 to the extent you have?","Mike DeWalt ","Yeah. If we look at the lower level components, actually we\u2019re not forecasting a very significant change up or down in sort of those different end markets, industrial, marine, oil and gas, the forecast even by account lower level is not dramatically different. So, there is, I would say the mix is probably, maybe just a slight bit negative in that. One of the segments that will probably have some growth after a pretty poor year in 2012 is industrial, that\u2019s been down quite a bit so far this year. I think that\u2019s looking at may be a little bit of improvement next year. But even as I say that the change overall is fairly flat the change even below that level is not very dramatic.","","Timothy Thein - Citigroup","Okay, got you. And just back on mining, is it the outlook [Technical Difficulty] in China clearly you have been working on getting your inventories down for several quarters now. Where do you think the industry is in that regard and from here do you think it\u2019s a six month process to clear the excess inventory for the industry or do you think it\u2019s more of a multi-year process? And what\u2019s happening to pricing in the region, are you seeing any customer trade down in terms of product quality?","","Mike DeWalt","","Well, couple of very good question Ross, couple of things one, just in terms of shifting around customers we tend to be certainly the premium product there and although sales are depressed in China not very good, we\u2019ve tended to do a little bit better than the market overall, so in a down market we are doing okay. In terms of the inventory part of your question, I think the way I would describe is we have made steady inventory reductions in China, both us and dealers have finished inventory. But its not been as fast as we would have thought and its not because we are producing anymore than we were expecting, it\u2019s because the sales have just remained pretty low. We have not really seen a pickup there yet. So a part of the inventory reduction that we were expecting as we march through the year, we were thinking, we would get a little bit of help from sales which isn\u2019t happening. So I think if you look at how weak it is there. My guess is the rest, and I don't know their stuff, our competitors don\u2019t report their inventories to me.","But if they are anything like us, it\u2019s probably a case where it\u2019s going down but not as fast as we would all like. I think it will, it\u2019s probably going to remain elevated until the selling season starts and that would probably begin mid-February that's the first opportunity I think for a more meaningful reduction. ","Ed Rapp","Hey Rose this is Ed, the one I want to add to that you know you asked about pricing side as we talked about before you are seeing a lot of, if you would package merchandising. I think the other thing we have seen happen in China is they try to business model in the way we work with cap finances really played out. You do hear a certain amount of noise that our competition with their [struggles] on the receivable side, but if you look at cap finances reported results for the third quarter very solid, as (inaudible) down and then it just gets back to the discipline at which we run that business, I think its serving us well in place to see [Technical Difficulty] in China.","Doug Oberhelman","Yeah, it\u2019s Oberhelman. I want to pile on again on China and inventory. We have been reluctant to massively lower inventory suddenly and we are doing in a very measured way. Most of our production there today is for export around the world. We need more capacity; we have it today, but frankly I am worried about any kind of recovery in China and not having inventory ready. So we have done this in a very measured fashion, all the way down this year and I would expect that to continue; while we want inventory down, and we\u2019re a bit high, we cannot let us ourselves in to a position where we don\u2019t have inventory to match the market when it that recover and we will be there, I suspect fairly soon and again it comes back to what happens with demand on the ground inside China going into \u201813 and we\u2019ll know this; we\u2019re going to know this likely in the first quarter which way is it going.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup","And just a follow-up on your growth projects at MINExpo, you made it clear that you had temporary delayed several of your projects. Is that\u2019s still the case and in your outlook you mentioned, GDP accelerating at 8.5%, if you see signs of that really unfolding in the first half of the year till those projects come back on very quickly?","Doug Oberhelman","We have slowed the expansion of our China facilities, as I mentioned at MINExpo. In fact we just laid that we\u2019ve not and deferred that we haven\u2019t cancelled it at all, we\u2019re going to look at again what happens in \u201913. But as I said before on many occasions and I\u2019ll say again, having just come back from China; China is under excavated on a per capita basis by any metric to the rest of the world. So we know where that\u2019s going to go overtime and we have to be there with capacity. So right now it\u2019s a juggling act between how much do we lower inventory, how much do we slow capacity expansion knowing full well that and I don't know if it\u2019s six months, one year, two year or five years, we're going to need a lot more than we have today. And your second question, I am sorry was \u2013 I forgot?","Timothy Thein - Citigroup","I think you got most of it there. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","JPMorgan. First, just a clarification on the model, how should we think about modeling the logistics business going forward, it wasn\u2019t really clear in the press release or in any of the Q&A\u2019s?","Mike DeWalt","Ann, with the logistics business, okay, we have actually several things going on with acquisitions and divestitures. We\u2019ve bought Siwei in the quarter that\u2019s a Chinese underground coal company; a year ago we bought MWM or not quite a year ago and then we sold a part of the logistics business, so there are pieces coming in and pieces going out. I think for the logistics piece in and of itself, if you look at our all other segments, most of the sales decline there was logistics, it\u2019s a bit little less than $100 million a month in terms of sales, but then again, we have an add-on for Siwei as well. So we have things that are going in both directions, overall certainly from a topline perspective the net of them isn\u2019t going to be a big difference next year. So in other words when we talk about our expectations then next year is kind of plus or minus the same as this year, we didn\u2019t mention acquisitions, because we have some coming in and some going out.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Yeah. Just to as we know where Siwei goes, we know where MWM goes, but there is just no reference to, so you said logistics is about $100 million in sales per month?","Mike DeWalt","No, it\u2019s less, it\u2019s a bit less than that; you can look at our release today based on when we sold it, we had absence of about two months of sales; it would have been less than $200 million in the quarter impact.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Okay, that\u2019s somewhat helpful. And then my second question is, you had noted that in order to reduce inventories particularly in China that you are going to have to use some marketing programs?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Can you talk both about what kind of marketing efforts you are having to make in China to liquidate the inventories and also are we looking now at very broad based marketing dollars being spent to move products all over the world, both out of dealer inventory and out of your inventory?","Mike DeWalt","","I think the best guy to answer that question is going to be the new Head of our Construction business sitting to my right here?","Brad Halverson","Yeah Ann, yeah I would say in China today you have a fairly broad based portion in terms of the merchandizing programs and kind of as we reported last time a good portion of that is coming through the packaging of different offerings all the way from financing to trade and allowances to those types of things.","And I think that as Doug said earlier, we are seeing some good results relative to our position in that market because it really plays to the strength of our business model. Yeah, we\u2019ve slowed some of the capital as we talked about in China, but we haven\u2019t slowed the build out of that business model, dealer locations, building out our services be it insurance or financing, building out the product support side of it, the things like logistics capability and re-man, so we continue to build out that business model. So going after that complete merchandizing package really does I would say play to our strengths.","I think in terms of how that\u2019s playing out around the world, it\u2019s a bit different in different parts of the world depending on what segment you are operating in. As you have seen year-over-year progress in the States; sales, these are still with a pretty good growth trade. We talked about Europe being weak, but Africa, Middle East and CIS holding, so there is different play out depending on the different geographies around the world. But you have seen third quarter overall price realization was quite positive.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Okay. And just while I have you on the line, curious just what the thinking was and in terms of moving the headquarters for the Construction business out of Hong Kong which is obviously closer to China to Singapore, was there any reason for that in particular?","Brad Halverson","Ann I would say its two-fold. First of all, also included an announcement is the appointment of Qihua Chen as an officer based in Beijing; I\u2019ll tell you, one of our great leaders and I would say a great leader and just happens to be Chinese. And so having an officer on the ground in China is a huge step forward and he will play a great role. The other reason is that if you go back in history, we really moved our Asian operation headquarters to Singapore; it\u2019s where we got a bigger concentration of our people, product managers, to purchasing organizations those kinds of resources. So it puts me right smack in the middle of that. Trust me, I fully understand, it\u2019s a mailbox, because a good portion of the time is being spend on the road, but those of us do thinks really to that decision.","Operator","Thank you. Our next today is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research","It\u2019s Vertical Research and good morning everybody. I just had two quick questions on mining. Have you seen any reduction in hours run on mining equipment and do you expect any forecast on the diminution and how you see the growth or contraction parts whether to a de-stocker or cut hours and second, are you allowing cancellations, I mean, you had been at one point I think kind of sold out for \u201913. I know you allowed push outs. So I am just curious if you allowed any cancellations or whether just that the clients seemed a little bit surprising given how robust the backlog had been. So I just wanted to see if the stuff have been pushed over to \u201914 or cancelled?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, Rob, just comment on the whole hours work question. I think if we use our aftermarket business as probably a reasonable indicator of that. It would tell us that activity levels and actually if you look at mine production levels as well, they look pretty good. I think the one place where that\u2019s not the case where versus a year ago, it's actually down, is eastern coal in the US. So actually that\u2019s the one spot of weakness certainly in the aftermarket a part of it. In terms of your cancellation question, yeah, there have been some cancellations. It's not been usually significant. For the most part, what customers have done, it is two things. ","One; you can see this based on the backlog, there is not a lot of new order activity, for new equipment and of course the aftermarket piece is just cycled through. And two, we had some pushed outs; we had some sales, shipments that we would have thought, would have come in the fourth quarter of this year that our pushed in the \u201913, some from the \u201913 pushed beyond that. So it's a combination of lower orders and some delays, not big cancellations.","Ed Rapp","Rob, this is Ed. You wondered about the cancellations as you mentioned in the past. We\u2019ve openly communicated to our dealers that the order cancellations in the late \u201908 timeframe was an anomaly or an exception. It\u2019s the liquidity crisis, no one was certain, where it was going to end up and so we made some steps there, it\u2019s not part of our ongoing practices with our dealers and we want them to understand the risk that comes with the ordering process to keep good honesty in the order board. And also, as we\u2019ve talked openly, we don\u2019t see a recession coming in 2013, we see things a lot differently than we did in that period. So, like I said, an exception to our standard ordering practice, back in \u201908 and \u201909 you\u2019re seeing us now move back to more of our standard practice. ","Mike DeWalt","Okay. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Mike, maybe I could ask you about the western hemisphere in terms of construction, obviously the US market has held up better than some other markets. Have you seen any order slowdown from dealers in that market? And you talked about growth in the market next year, confidence level around that, I noticed your housing start number was pretty good too?","Mike DeWalt ","Yeah. A couple of things, sales to users in let\u2019s say North America, the rate of growth has slowed down a little bit, now again September, it\u2019s a little bit unusual we had four weekends last year in September, the way the calendar fell this year we had five, so the flipside of that it will happen in October. So, September, I think because of the calendar was probably a little weaker month. But, if you go back to the fourth quarter of last year, North America was up like, close to 50%, I mean it was up a lot, there was, I think a little bit of probably extra buying in the sales to users because of the depreciation rules at the time, probably a little bit of a pull forward if you will under the fourth quarter I think particularly the dealer a dealer level. So I would fully expect that if you are looking at year-over-year growth rates, I expect those growth rates to come down a little bit in North America; that doesn\u2019t mean that sales to users or kind of sequentially seasonally adjusted getting worst, it just means that the fourth quarter of last year was quite a bit better than the second, third quarter a year ago. ","We are reasonably constructive on US in terms of construction activity, housing, really does seem to be on demand I mean it\u2019s not blooming but it really seems to have turned to corner and is getting a little better. So that should help if we can get this election and year end tax and spending cliff dealt with I think there is opportunity for comps even to get a little bit better. So I think we are fairly constructive you said the western hemisphere, so I will move to Latin America. ","In Brazil which is one of our more important countries in Latin America in terms of sales, we\u2019ve had a pretty steady improvement year-over-year in terms of sales to end users. I mean the government there has been constructive I think on monetary and credit policies. We have seen our sales to users or dealers delivers to end users get better. But I think we are, I would say we are reasonably positive on that as we move forward as well. I don\u2019t know Andy that I answered all your questions.","","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","","You did Mike just one America you know your sales were still down sequentially, I mean is the Argentina that sort of run its [close] or you just haven\u2019t been delivering a lot there but I think that stopped sort of in February of this year somewhere that should have easily compares there as you go forward?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, Argentina has been just quite severe declines there. And I think, if you look at our sales in Latin America too, you have a little bit of a different situation. The construction business in Brazil, dealers have actually been cutting inventory there a little bit, actually in the country of Brazil the inventories went down a little bit in the quarter. So our sales there are little bit less then real demand already. And on that as the demand continues to increase there and the dealers get their inventory in line at some point here orders and sales of hours we will start matching and we will get close to that user demand, so that's a temporary thing.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, and then just real quickly. You said as profitability a little lower sequentially looks like less than 5%. Usually they have a strong fourth quarter, so is that kind of what we were anticipating here that one of the reasons why operating cost it was lower?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, I think our view of this [hour], if you look at what happened in the fourth quarter a year ago, just a shift in their both sales and profitability going from third to fourth, there is an up tick, they just historically have made a higher portion of their profit in sales in the fourth quarter, so we would be looking for that to improve in the fourth quarter as well.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Jim?","Jim Umpleby","Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.","We had another great quarter with outstanding performance by our global team. Second quarter sales and revenues were $14 billion, 24% higher than the second quarter of 2017. We saw increased sales in all three of our primary segments and in all geographic regions. Profit per share of $2.82 was the best second quarter performance in our company history.","Operating and profit increased 83% and adjusted profit per share was nearly double what it was in the same quarter last year. For those of you that have followed us through the cycles, you can recognize that our team did an excellent job managing costs, as we significantly increased production, which allowed us to deliver record quarterly profit per share. We are a higher performing company today as a result of our team\u2019s cost discipline, the application of the Operating & Execution Model and restructuring actions we\u2019ve implemented across the Company in recent years.","As the numbers show, we are delivering on the commitments made at our Investor Day, last September. We ended the quarter with $8.7 billion cash on hand and demonstrated our commitment to consistently return capital to shareholders in a disciplined way by increasing the quarterly cash dividend by 10% per share and repurchasing $750 million of the Company\u2019s common stock. We have repurchased $1.25 billion of stock since the first of the year. Sustainable dividend growth and returning capital to shareholders remain high priorities for us.","Now, to our outlook. We\u2019ve had a great start to the year and there\u2019s continued improvement in many of our end markets. So, we\u2019re raising our profit per share outlook for the full-year. We feel good about the state of our business. Most of our markets continue to improve in the second quarter. Our order rates and the backlog remain strong. For certain applications, particularly in oil & gas and mining, we are taking orders for delivery well into 2019. We\u2019re very focused on the products, services and innovation which will fuel future growth. We intend to continue investing in the expanded offerings and services that are core components of our strategy. Digital initiatives like e-commerce connecting assets and autonomous machines as well as new engine technologies and machine programs.","Here are a few examples to showcase what we\u2019re accomplishing. For expanded offerings, we have introduced the 20-ton class of next-generation excavators which offer unique combinations of purpose-built features designed to match customers\u2019 productivity and cost targets. The services component of our strategy has multiple initiatives, and we continue to invest in our digital capabilities. We have about 700,000 connected assets, roughly 30% more than the number of assets we cited at Investor Day.","We have the largest number of autonomous machines in the mining industry, and these autonomous solutions have helped customers experience 20% productivity improvement over best-in-class mine sites. As part of an ongoing pilot, a large customer recently moved the first payload using the fully autonomous CAT 400-ton haul truck in the oil sands. This is the largest autonomous truck ever put into a productive operating environment.","As part of our services strategy, we\u2019ve increased the number of products sold with customer support agreements. We\u2019ve also made two acquisitions in early 2018 to increase our service capabilities for our rail customers. We continue to make strategic investments in engine technologies such as advanced engine controls, high-performance air and fuel systems and new material compositions in our pursuit of improved power density, efficiency and emissions.","On the issue of trade, we urge government leaders to take actions to remove uncertainty. As a global manufacturer, Caterpillar has long advocated for free trade because it enhances global competitiveness and helps U.S. manufacturers grow U.S. jobs and exports. Based on the current situation, we\u2019ve assumed incremental tariff-related costs of $100 million to $200 million for the rest of the year. Even with these new costs, we are raising our 2018 outlook. We are confident that our strategy positions us to capitalize on current market opportunities and manage through dynamic environments.","In summary, this was a great all-round quarter for sales growth, operational performance and capital deployment. We delivered record second quarter profit per share and raised the full-year outlook. Our financial position is strong. We feel good about our markets and will remain focused on structural cost control while investing for profitable growth. These results continue to give us confidence that our strategy with the core components of operational excellence, expanded offerings and services framed by the fundamental discipline of the Operating & Execution Model is delivering value for our customers and our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Joe.","Joe Creed","All right. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone.","Let\u2019s start with a brief overview of the headline numbers on slide four.","As Jim mentioned, the team performed extremely well in the second quarter. Sales and revenues for the second quarter increased to $14 billion, 24% higher than the second quarter of 2017, as we continue to ramp production to meet higher demand. Our end markets remain strong, most notably North America and China construction, as well as North American onshore oil and gas. Mining sales, while still in the early stages of recovery, were also up, as we are seeing increased orders and deliveries for new equipment in addition to aftermarket parts.","Once again, profit per share of $2.82 was the best second quarter performance in our company history. Adjusted profit per share of $2.97 was about double last year, driven primarily by the higher sales volume and continued cost discipline.","We have a strong balance sheet and ended the quarter with $8.7 billion of enterprise cash. ME&T operating cash flow was $2.1 billion in the quarter. Also, we have demonstrated our commitment to return capital to shareholders by increasing the quarterly dividend by 10% per share and repurchasing $750 million of the Company\u2019s common stock. As the numbers reflect, this was a great quarter for sales growth, operational performance and capital deployment. These results continue to give us confidence in our strategy for using the operating execution model to drive profitable growth through operational excellence as well as expanded offerings and services for our customers.","Now, turn to slide five and we\u2019ll discuss operating profit.","Operating profit in the second quarter was almost $2.2 billion, an increase of 83% compared to the second quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 16.3% on the high-end of our Investor Day range, and 440 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2017. While we expect operating margins to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the second quarter represents an impressive improvement and demonstrates the operating leverage, we have across the Company due to our restructuring efforts and ongoing cost discipline. Again, I want to thank our global team for their commitment to operational excellence, which can clearly be seen in this quarter\u2019s results.","As you see in the chart, higher sales volume across all three of our primary segments contributed an additional $1 billion of operating profit, compared to the same quarter last year. Price realization was about $90 million in the second quarter, more than offsetting higher manufacturing costs.","Let\u2019s expand on manufacturing costs for a minute. They increased roughly $80 million compared to last year as higher freight and material costs were partially offset by lower warranty expense. In the quarter, higher freight costs drove the largest increase to manufacturing costs. That\u2019s a result of several factors, including higher freight rates due to strain capacity in the trucking industry, less efficient freight loads and expedited freight as we continue to ramp production to meet increased demand.","Material costs were up about 1%, driven largely by higher steel costs, an increase we anticipated because of higher commodity prices. Freight costs remained well-controlled in the quarter, up less than 3% compared to last year, even with 24% higher sales and revenues. And finally, financial products was unfavorable $56 million. However, the core business is performing well. Higher past-dues and increased write-offs this quarter were primarily limited to a few customers in Cat Power and a review of the recent collection experience of our Latin America portfolio.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at the performance of each segment, beginning with Construction Industries on slide six.","Sales for Construction Industries were $6.2 billion in the second quarter, an increase of $1.2 billion or 24% from 2017. CI sales increased across all regions with the strongest performance in Asia Pacific and North America. Asia Pacific sales were up 43% or about $500 million, driven primarily by China. We are seeing continued investment in building construction and infrastructure.","Sales of excavators in China remained strong in the second quarter with industry sales for the 10-ton and above excavator up more than 70% year-to-date. North America also continued to be a bright spot for CI in the quarter with sales up about $400 million or 18%. Much of the sales increase was driven by investment in non-residential construction and oil & gas-related projects, including pipeline. Segment profit increased 28% over the last year to $1.2 billion, which is a record for CI. And operating margin in the quarter was 18.7%, exceeding the Investor Day range. Higher sales volume was the primary driver of the profit improvement. This was partially offset by unfavorable price realization and higher cost for material, freight, as well as SG&A and R&D. Pricing was competitive in the second quarter, especially in some of our key regions for CI. However, we did announce a mid-year price increase for machines that took effect on July 1st.","Now, let\u2019s move on to slide seven.","The Resource Industries team turned in a second quarter. Sales for RI were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 38% from year ago. In addition to ongoing aftermarket parts demand to support machine activity and rebuild, sales for new equipment increased across all regions. Our mining customers are placing orders on new equipment as commodity prices remain above investment thresholds. However, we believe mining customers have yet to begin full scale fleet replacement. In addition, global economic growth and infrastructure investment contributed to higher sales of heavy construction equipment. Segment profit of $411 million was more than four times higher than the second quarter of 2017 and segment margin improved to 16.3%, which surpasses the Investor Day range of 12% to 16%. RI\u2019s improved performance and margin expansion is primarily due to operating leverage gained through significant restructuring and the team\u2019s disciplined cost management. In fact, RI period costs were about flat with 38% higher sales.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide eight, and we will discuss Energy & Transportation. E&T sales in the second quarter were $5.7 million, 20% higher than the same quarter last year with sales increasing across all applications. Sales in the oil and gas applications were up $400 million or 39%, as we continue to see strength in onshore activities in North America, especially for gas compression and well servicing applications. For power generation, sales increased 13%, driven primarily by sales of gas powered applications in EAME. Our industrial application sales increased 10%, largely driven by improving global economic conditions and higher end user demand across most applications. And finally, transportation, sales were up 14%, driven by our two recent acquisitions in rail services, one in Europe and one in Australia along with increased rail traffic in North America. Marine was also up slightly due to higher sales into the cruise sector.","Segment profit for Energy & Transportation was just over $1 billion, up about $300 million from last year. The segment margin improved over 300 basis points to 17.7%, which is at the high end of the Investor Day range. E&T\u2019s profit improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. This was partially offset by higher freight costs.","Before I move to the outlook, I want to spend a moment talking about capital deployment on slide nine.","As I mentioned earlier, our ME&T operating cash flow was $2.1 billion in the second quarter and we finished the quarter with $8.7 billion of enterprise cash on hand. While we\u2019re committed to investing to profitably grow our business, we also have the benefit of strong operating cash flow and a solid balance sheet, which provide the flexibility to continue returning capital to shareholders. We intend to do this in a disciplined way by focusing on sustainable dividend growth and being in the market for share repurchases on a fairly consistent basis. In line with this strategy, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% per share and repurchased $750 million of common stock in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total repurchases to $1.25 billion. We expect share repurchases in the second half of the year to be in a range similar to the first half, but we could be more opportunistic, depending on market conditions and investing priorities.","Our current share repurchases authorization expires at the end of this year. To ensure continuity of our cash deployment priorities, the Board of Directors approved a new $10 billion share repurchase authorization, which is effective January 1, 2019 with no exploration date. Again, the team delivered an outstanding second quarter.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 10 and look at the details of our updated outlook.","As we said in our release this morning, based on our strong year-to-date performance and our current view of our end markets, we are raising our full-year profit per share outlook to a range of $10.50 to $11.50. Excluding restructuring costs of about $400 million, we now expect adjusted profit per share to be in a range of $11 to $12.","I\u2019ll share some perspective on our various end markets in more detail on the next slide but first ","let\u2019s talk about a few items that are included in this outlook. We feel good about the state of our business. Most of our end markets continued to improve in the second quarter. Order rates and the backlog remained strong. For certain applications, particularly in oil & gas and mining, we continue taking orders for delivery well into 2019. Recently imposed tariffs had minimal impact on the quarter but are expected to impact our second half material costs by approximately $100 million to $200 million. We also expect freight costs to remain elevated as we ramp production to meet higher demand.","However, we intend to offset most of these headwinds through mid-year price increases and continued use of the Operating & Execution Model to drive operational excellence and structural cost discipline. We will also continue to invest in our future, focusing our investments on expanded offerings and services. In addition to new machine and engine programs, we are also investing in digital technologies that are expanding the services and the solutions we offer our customers.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at our end markets in a little more detail on slide 11.","The slide reflects our current view of the end markets we serve. As you can see, our end markets are at various stages. Some are experiencing strong demand, some are in the early stages of recovery and some remain challenged compared to historical levels. For Construction Industries, we are experiencing strong product demand in Asia Pacific, North America, and EAME while sales in Latin America are still depressed. Given the strong selling season, our backlog is down slightly compared to the first quarter. This reflects normal seasonal patterns for CI, and our order rates remain healthy. As you know, North American retail stats just turned positive in May of last year after 24 consecutive months of decline. We believe demand will continue to be strong with investments in nonresidential construction and oil & gas related projects, including pipeline.","For Resource Industries, robust economic growth and infrastructure investments are driving strong demand in heavy construction applications. However, for global mining customers, we believe this recovery is still in the early stages. What started a strong demand for aftermarket parts and rebuild has recently progressed to increased demand for new equipment. Commodity prices continue to be above investment threshold, which is improving the financial health of many mining customers. We are working hard to continue to increase production with our suppliers and at our facilities. In the second quarter, our production and shipping activity kept pace with the increase in order rate, and as a result, the backlog for RI remained flat.","Energy & Transportation is our most diverse segment and serves a wide variety of end markets. Sales in the North America gas compression and well servicing applications remained very strong. The Permian basin contains the most drill rigs and uncompleted wells in the U.S. and we expect growth in the region to continue. We are also continuing to see increased activity across other shale basins in the U.S. as recent market conditions have enabled them to be profitable. While gas compression and well servicing demand is strong in North America, we continue to see weak demand for new equipment for on and offshore drilling as well as offshore oil and gas production. Power generation is experiencing a demand increase, following the multiyear downturn in sales. The improvement is driven mostly by demand for powering datacenters and gas powered applications in EAME. While sales are expected to be up in 2018, we believe this year will still be well below our recent high in 2012.","Sales for industrial applications are strong, largely due to improving global economic conditions and higher end-user demand across most applications. The North American rail market is showing signs of recovery. Total carloads improved and stored locomotives were down for the second quarter. While we have received orders for new locomotives, the demand is low compared to historic levels. We have however seen a significant increase for rail services and locomotive rebuild. For marine sales, we\u2019re seeing improvements for cruise and tugboats but the marine market continues to be challenged, especially for workboats supporting offshore oil platforms.","In summary, we feel good about our end markets, many of which continue to be strong, while others are recovering. And we are confident our corporate strategy positions us well to manage through this dynamic environment.","Now, I\u2019d like to give a quick update on the execution of our strategy on slide 12.","Recall, at Investor Day last September, we provided target operating margin ranges for all three segments and for the Company. Those ranges reflected our expectations for significantly improved performance at achievable sales levels that we had seen in the past.","Slide 12 shows our consolidated sales and revenues and adjusted operating margin history back to 2012, which was our peak for sales and revenues. The column on the far right reflects our consolidated Investor Day range operating margin range of 14% to 17%, at sales levels of about $55 billion. As the numbers show, we are delivering on our commitment. The last 12 months of sales and revenues dating back to July of 2017 were just over $51 billion with an adjusted operating margin of 15% that\u2019s more than 100 basis points higher than our 2012 performance, which was achieved on sales and revenues of almost $66 billion.","Like Jim said, running the business, using the operating execution model, coupled with restructuring actions have made us the higher performing company. We are committed to delivering stronger performance throughout the cycle. We are relentless in control of our structural costs as evidenced by our results, but these results aren\u2019t all about cost control. The real power of the Operating & Execution Model comes from focusing resources on growing our most profitable businesses to maximize returns, like investments in the next-gen excavator, autonomous technologies, connecting assets and expanding our ecommerce platform to name a few. This demonstrated performance along with our current view of key end markets gives us the confidence to raise our full year outlook for 2018.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 13, and I\u2019ll conclude with a quick summary.","We are delivering on our commitments and our strategy is working. We delivered record second-quarter profit per share, raised the full-year outlook, and are returning capital to shareholders. We\u2019re confident in our end markets and will remain focused on structural cost control while investing for profitable growth.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A portion of the call.","Amy Campbell","Thank you, Joe. Kate, we\u2019re ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Andrew Casey","Wells Fargo Securities. Good morning, everybody. Couple questions on margins. First, does the updated guidance still incorporate an expectation that Q1 performance would be the best of the year? And then, second, looking at slide 12, I\u2019m just wondering how to put everything in context. Given your growth initiatives and how quickly the segment margin performance has either exceeded or gone toward the top end of Investor Day ranges, I am just wondering should we expect further upside to margin performance, even with how good it\u2019s been so far?","Jim Umpleby","Andy, this is Jim. I will address the second part of your question first. So, as you indicated, we gave the expected operating margin targets for known, achievable sales levels in the recent past. We -- obviously, if in fact, sales are higher in each of those segments, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect higher margin percentages. However, we also want to grow our business, as we talked about at Investor Day. So, if we\u2019re at the top end of one of those ranges and we have the opportunity to increase sales significantly and hope there is specific opportunity, discrete opportunity that allows us to increase sales but keeps that margin percentage at the end top of that range, that\u2019s something we will do. However, obviously, higher sales, one should expect, in general, higher operating margin percentages.","Joe Creed","This is Joe. From quarter-to-quarter, I would expect, those operating margin ranges could bounce around a little bit, but I don\u2019t think we would expect any -- second half to be significantly different than what we\u2019ve seen through the first half of this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joe O\u2019Dea. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Hi. Good morning. It\u2019s Vertical Research. On tariffs and trade, just in terms of backward looking on the quarter, really doesn\u2019t seem like much of a disruption. As you think about just the customer interactions over the course of the quarter though, and in particular related to China, anything that you seeing relative to your direct exposure with China on utilization levels of equipment over the course of the past couple months, anything on the demand side with excavators? And then, when we think about the indirect exposure, and I guess, in particular as it relate to mining and anything there where you would see a little bit increased customer unease on mining, just as it relates to some of the headlines around trade?","Jim Umpleby","Joe, it\u2019s Jim. To answer the first part of your question. Our business in China continues to be strong. We haven\u2019t seen an impact of the trade tension on our business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. We feel good about our business and our markets continue to look quite good. We also haven\u2019t seen a negative impact from mining either. Obviously, as one looks at global economic conditions and global economic growth, there is a whole variety of factors that feed into what the global economies will be. But as we stand here today, we feel good about our markets and our demand remains strong.","Joe O\u2019Dea","Got it. And then, just on construction pricing, and the midyear increases. Is that something that we start to see in 3Q or just given the backlog, does that take a little bit of time to actually show up in the results that we will see?","Amy Campbell","No. I\u2019m glad you asked, Joe. So, I think you are right on there. Given the backlog and the time it takes for that midyear price action to work through, we would expect some lag. So, we would expect to start to see the favorability for the midyear price increase in Construction Industries to be little later in the year, maybe towards the end of the third quarter into the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Stephen Volkmann","It\u2019s Jefferies. So, I\u2019m wondering Jim, maybe we can go back quickly to something you said I think in response to Andy\u2019s question. Do you have a big backlog or pipeline of things that you would like to fund with respect to growth initiatives that may start to come in at a faster pace going forward?","Jim Umpleby","We are continually evaluating opportunities for investment to fuel future growth. We have talked about what we\u2019re doing in our services. Obviously it\u2019s a big area of focus for us. And we are investing in our digital capabilities. But we do have a list of things we\u2019d like to invest in. We feel comfortable in our ability to do that while continuing to maintain our performance. I mean, there is a whole list of things we could talk about. I think, you\u2019ve read some of our press releases about what we were doing with autonomous vehicles, site solutions, power density, engine emissions. So, yes, we do have a list of things as we always do of items that we are investing in. But again, we are committed to do this in the environment of continuing to perform as a company, financially.","Stephen Volkmann","And then, if I could just focus for one second on slide 11 where you talked about end market assumptions. It looks like one way you could kind of read that as things that are sort of below normal, things that are kind of in line with normal, and things that are stronger than normal. And first of all, if you would like to dissuade me from that interpretation, feel free. But, I\u2019m curious how you think of the overall business with respect to their various cycles? Clearly, the market is worried about where the industrial cycle is and where the things may be kind of mid-cycle or above. And I\u2019m curious if you have an opinion as to sort of where we are overall with CAT cycles?","Jim Umpleby","It is important to keep in mind that Caterpillar is a diverse business. I think a lot of time they look at our business, they will just think of construction, and that\u2019s why we took the time to go through that slide and Joe went through that with you. So, again, Joe laid it out pretty well on this in the slide. There are certain parts of our business that are certainly below what we would consider a normal range, some that -- and have not started to recover. We have some that are still below what we consider normal demand in our recovery; and then we have some that are very strong and we try to lay that out in our slide.","Amy Campbell","I think to further add on to that, those end markets that are in the far right hand column there of strong demand, I mean, if you look at EAME, while we consider it strong and it\u2019s been growing for this last several years, it\u2019s actually still a little below sales levels that we achieved earlier this decade and well below sales levels a decade ago kind of in the middle of the last decade. So, we are seeing consistent growth in the EAME but it\u2019s not above where we were earlier 5, 6 years ago. Say the same thing about industrial. We also see good healthy growth but those sales levels continue to be a little below some highs achieved a few years ago and really the same thing for Resource Industries. So, we look at North America as very strong that\u2019s after several years of below trend sales. We\u2019ve also talked about China also being a very strong region, but we still see -- if we look specifically at the 10-ton and above excavator, we expect sales for that product and the industry to be below the peak that it achieved in 2011. So, it\u2019s a little bit difficult to put these on an exact equilibrium. I think, what we wanted to be very clear about is that the markets are in different phases of the cycle. But, there still is opportunity for growth really probably across most of them.","Joe Creed","And this is Joe. Just exactly what you said, Amy, I agree, it wasn\u2019t intended. You can\u2019t take the far right column and say everything in there is above mid-cycle. That wasn\u2019t the intent. It was just the intent to say we\u2019re getting strong demand on those products, and where we\u2019re seeing demand and that we are diverse and then we have industries that are in various stages of recovery at the moment.","Jim Umpleby","And one of the things we\u2019re pleased with is our record financial performance, even though we have a number of key markets that are quite weak. Offshore oil & gas is when we talked about this is quite weak, new locomotives is weak, mining improving but it\u2019s still well below what we consider a normal levels. So, again, the fact that we\u2019re trending a record performance with those key markets, where they are we feel good about.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Ann Duignan","Good morning. JP Morgan. I\u2019ve got a quick clarification question and then my real question. So, the clarification question is just on your revised guidance, what\u2019s embedded in that for share repurchases because originally you did not have any share repurchases in your guidance. So, if you could just tell us, is it the first half that\u2019s done and over or have you embedded any share repurchases into the back half?","Amy Campbell","You are correct, Ann. We typically have not forecasted share repurchase and our -- the guide that we put out there, the adjusted profit per share of $11 to $12, we have assumed, as Joe said that we would be fairly consistent in the second half with share repurchases as we were in the first half. And so, it can be 1.25 in the first half, call it 2 to 2.5 in the second half or 2.5 I guess would be.","[Multiple Speakers]","Joe Creed","2.5ish, in that range, for the full year.","Amy Campbell","I will say Ann, I\u2019m going to step back. I mean, that is a broad range. And so, we have played that in, but there is no a number of variables we\u2019ve got played into that range of $11 to $12 of adjusted profit per share.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And then, I appreciate the clarification. My question then is turning to China and your outlook for excavator sales. You had guided plus 30% and you had called that the cycle was above normal this year and that\u2019s how you were being cautious. Now we\u2019re up 70% year-to-date. What\u2019s your recent thinking on excavator sales in China going forward, particularly in light of some of the policy easing that the government is doing to help support PPPs and things like that? What\u2019s your latest thoughts on the markets there?","Amy Campbell","Yes. So, for China in the first quarter, we talked about the 10-ton and above excavator demand for the industry being up about 30%. We now have that forecast up about 40%. So, we\u2019ve raised that expectation for the rest of the year. That industry class is up 70% year-to-date. So, that does imply that there will be slowing growth in the back half of the year. If you recall, the back half of 2017 saw some pretty significant growth levels. And so, the comps gets to be quite difficult. We do expect this year for China sales to have more normal seasonal pattern. So, while in the second half of last year, China sales were higher than the first half, that\u2019s a bit unusual, we expect more of the 60-40, 60% of sales in the first half of the year, 40% in the back half of the year, Ann.","Ann Duignan","And your thoughts on the ongoing -- just based on what you\u2019re seeing infrastructure wise in China?","Amy Campbell","Yes. They continue to be active. We continue to feel good about our end markets. We do have some dealer inventory to grow in China. I think, we continue to keep an eye on what\u2019s the pretty dynamic environment.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","David Raso","Evercore ISI. Thank you. Back to slide 11 on the end market outlook. And I know you feel very confidently about the categories that are in the strong demand area, which is all well and good. But, if you could maybe bless these numbers, I\u2019m just curious. Even the businesses that are in the strong demand area, I\u2019m coming up with at most 45% to 50% of revenues and probably a little bit lower than that on operating profit, call 40 to 45 on a normalized basis. So, I\u2019m just trying understand, is that the right way to look at it? Yes. The strong demand businesses are areas that you still feel good about and they can grow. But even without that, you have the first two categories in the left that are the majority of sales and earnings. Is that a fair way to assume how we are supposed to read that breakdown? I know, you don\u2019t give all those businesses exactly by sales and revenues, but obviously I try to take a stab at it. Can you help with that question and sanity check that thought.","Amy Campbell","Yes.","Joe Creed","This is Joe. I would say -- I don\u2019t have those figures in front of me and we don\u2019t normally disclose in that way. And keep in mind, they\u2019ll vary depending on where these businesses move around on this chart right. But, I think you\u2019re thinking about it in a correct way. Our point is, as Jim mentioned earlier, if you think about record performance that we\u2019re turning in from how we\u2019re operating and running the company and we feel good about that relative to a significant portion of our business is but still recovering or early stages of recovery or still operating at pretty low level. So, we feel like not all of our markets are synchronized at this point and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.","David Raso","Again, just to make sure. So, the majority of your sales and EBIT are in those first two categories called slow to recover and recovering, and less than 50% of strong demand. I know you\u2019re saying those can grow beyond but just making sure we roughly frame it, is that a fair generalization?","Joe Creed","Yes. I don\u2019t know, Amy, if you have that. I wouldn\u2019t frame it that way. But...","Jim Umpleby","Yes. David, I don\u2019t have those numbers in front of me. So, I would be hesitant to frame it that way. I mean, I think we could go back and look at that. It should be relatively easy to calculate. But, sitting here, while you\u2019re talking I just -- I don\u2019t have that number in front of me. So, I\u2019m cautious to confirm it. It doesn\u2019t\u2026","David Raso","That\u2019s fine. We can go into detail offline. And lastly, the comment you had about second half operating margins being similar to the first quarter. To hit your EPS number, it seems to be implying the back half of the year, the sales growth is roughly 13%. And just given the order book is up 27%, at least the implied order book, the I want count, up over 27%, the backlog is up over 20%. A, is there something about your ability to take these orders in backlog and execute on them in the back half of the year that would suggest you want to be able to grow really anywhere close to the order book strength in the backlog, or is it just, we will obviously discuss future guidance when it comes up in the next quarter or two? I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand why would the sales growth be that much slower in the second half than your backlog and order growth.","Amy Campbell","Yes. So, keep in mind David that one of the things that we did this quarter is put the outlook out there, adjusted profit per share of $11 to $12, which reflects several variables that we think could be more or less favorable. We wanted to reflect a reasonable range that we think we can fall within. I do want to clarify one of your comments, which is we expect second half operating margin to be pretty similar to the first half, not necessarily the first quarter but pretty similar to the first half.","David Raso","Yes. I misspoke, I apologize. [multiple speakers]","Amy Campbell","I just wanted to clarify hat.","David Raso","I meant to say second half similar to -- first half was 17 too, [ph] second half if you assume 17 too, [ph] that\u2019s roughly the implied sales growth. That\u2019s all I wanted.","Amy Campbell","Yes. I think if you walk through the segments and if we are talking about volume specifically and again I think as we continue to work through supply chain challenges, we will get some more clarity as the rest of the year plays itself out. But, as we see it today, Resource Industries does continue to ramp production across many of their product lines and we would expect that. Energy & Transportation, we would expect to have really more we are seeing strength in the onshore oil and gas application, which is a piece of their portfolio. But, we would expect more normal seasonality first half, second half for Energy & Transportation. And with that expected seasonality in Construction Industries with China kind of 60-40 split. Even though we continue to see growing demand in some of other regions, we would I think expect Construction Industries to be more or less pretty even on sales first half over second half. And again, to clarify, there is still some runway to play out for the rest of the year. We do continue to work through supply chain challenges. But on a broader perspective, that\u2019s kind of how we are thinking about volumes for the rest of the year.","David Raso","Just to be clear, the supply chain isn\u2019t the reason if that math is correct to suggest why the growth should be that much lower than order books and backlogs? I\u2019m just making sure we\u2019re not trying to quietly highlight that much of the strength on the backlog and orders turning into sales in the back half. And you\u2019re saying some constraint but that\u2019s not what you are trying to say.","Amy Campbell","Yes. That\u2019s correct. That would be the correct assumption, David.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Joel Tiss. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Joel Tiss","Hi. It\u2019s BMO. So, I just wondered if there\u2019s any signaling at all from increasing the share repurchase that acquisitions are less of a priority or maybe they are expensive or just any color you can help us with there. ","Jim Umpleby","Yes. Won\u2019t try to apply anything there. So, we continue to evaluate M&A opportunities. But we have also talked about our desire to return cash to shareholders. So, we\u2019re not trying to imply anything there.","Joe Creed","Yes. I mean, as we said in our prepared remarks, our results are strong. We\u2019re in a strong financial position and we think we\u2019re in a position to be above.","Joel Tiss","And I just wonder, following up on that, can you give us just kind of a range for the free cash flow for the full year? And what was behind this accrued wages and salaries and employee benefits that it had a negative swing of about 1.4 billion year-over-year and I just wondered if there\u2019s any big chunks in there that we should be aware of.","Amy Campbell","Yes, sure. Joel, as you know, we don\u2019t provide a free cash flow outlook. But, you are correct, we did have the accrued wages increase. And that has to do with 2017 short-term incentive compensation, which we pay a quarter in arrears. And so, the 2017 short-term incentive compensation which I think was about 1.4 billion we paid in March of 2018, and that\u2019s compared to 200 to $300 million, I think it was about $250 million for 2016 short-term incentive compensation that we paid in the first quarter of 2017. So, that $1.2 billion, a difference will explain most of that change.","Joel Tiss","And that\u2019s not going to mean that the free cash flow in 2018 is somewhat a little bit below 2017 levels?","Amy Campbell","Well, I think, we would expect. Again, we don\u2019t have a free cash flow forecast, but we do expect operating profit at $11 to $12 versus $6.88 last year. We would have significantly higher operating profit. And that one issue around the payment of short-term incentive compensation expense won\u2019t repeat itself. That was a first quarter issue.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Jamie Cook","I guess, two questions. One, can you just talk about the level of visibility you have in 2019 relative to, as we were sitting here last year, you noted a couple times, good visibility in oil & gas and mining. So, I was hoping that you could just put some color around that maybe in terms of lead times. And then, my second question, what is your approach to pricing with some of these longer lead time products, in particular when we have the material cost headwinds, I\u2019m just -- don\u2019t want to get concerned that price in that cost could be a headwind in \u201819, without getting to far out?","Jim Umpleby","So, as we mentioned earlier, we are building some backlog in \u201819 for oil and gas and mining. To answer your specific question, one of the -- then back to the slide 11, one of the areas that has been slow certainly this year is offshore oil and gas. And so, for example, we are seeing increased quoting activity which is a positive sign, and that has to translate into specific orders. But, in fact oil prices stay strong and CapEx increases for the IOCs and NOCs, it wouldn\u2019t be any unreasonable for us to see increased sales in 2019 in offshore oil & gas for solar. Again, mining, we are seeing increased activity, increased quotation activity, and that\u2019s all positive thing. A lot of -- on the pricing question, obviously a lot of variables go into pricing. It\u2019s a competitive market. We make decisions based on using the O&E Model based on the specific market and the specific geographic area. But, I wouldn\u2019t be overly concerned, in 2019, with the price cost equation.","Joe Creed","Yes. And just to add a little bit there, Jamie. I think -- this is the Joe. Input cost is one of many factors that goes into the pricing decision as Jim said. And keep in mind, as we look at our input costs, we have a lot of levers to try to offset those, as we said, this year even continuing to use the operating execution model, executing our strategy, staying discipline on cost control operational excellence. So, I want -- while it\u2019s one factor, I want to make sure we\u2019re not just sort of ring fencing price, input cost, ratio, I know it\u2019s something that we look at. But we will use that as we look at pricing in 2019, input cost will be a big factor and what we\u2019re looking at adding into next year.","Jim Umpleby","And there is various elements that go into our cost of course. And if in fact, the costs are being driven by higher commodity prices, generally for Caterpillar that\u2019s a good thing, not a bad thing. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Rob Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Rob Wertheimer","It\u2019s Melius Research, and thank you. I had the questions really on dealer inventory. And the ","simple question is just, do you feel like dealers have the right inventory? Is it too high overall, is it to lower overall? And maybe a structural question, if you would, just give us a look under the hood. I mean, a year or so ago, your dealers probably didn\u2019t know that you could execute as well as you have into to a sharp up-cycle in lot of end markets. And so, I wonder how your dealers are feeling about the responsiveness of your production system and you know what that kind means for smoothness in the system overall?","Amy Campbell","Rob, I will start that. When you look at dealer inventory, we have been able to add a little over of $1 billion in dealer inventory, most of that in Construction Industries through the first half of the year to support what are higher demand levels. Even with that where we target with the dealers for dealer inventory, we\u2019re at the low end of our month of sales range. So, I\u2019m sure that there are pockets where dealers would like to have some more inventory. We continue to work with them there. But, I think broadly we\u2019re within that range. We feel good about that. Ultimately that is the dealer\u2019s decision. We\u2019re seeing as we continue to talk about really strong demand, our facilities continue to ramp production to keep up with customer demand. But overall, I\u2019d say, when we look at where dealer inventory is, we\u2019re very pleased with our ability to increase it through o the first half of this year and at the level it is, in terms of total months of sales. Does that answer your question?","Rob Wertheimer","It does. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Mike Shlisky. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Mike Shlisky","Good morning. It\u2019s Seaport Global. So, I want to ask about rail. I know you said in your slide that that market on the new site is still pretty slow to recover but you did also know in your comments that there were some strong order trends. So, can you give us a sense as to whether you already see, given the order trends, a clear path towards locomotive recovery over the next couple of quarters or any kind of timing as to when that might get better?","Jim Umpleby","I think what we\u2019ve talked about is we\u2019ve seen certain indicators, certainly on our services end that is improved. New locomotives in North America has been slow but some of the leading indicators, there are a number of stored locomotives is reducing which it is that tends to be a positive sign, a leading indicator. So, again, we think that the signs are positive.","Joe Creed","And we are seeing, as I mentioned also in prepared remarks, we are seeing orders for locomotive rebuild. So, that was also another positive sign and activity is picking up.","Mike Shlisky","And then, just secondly, as a follow-up on that. If you do start to see some more new builds of locomotives, is there any kind of major mix shift we should be thinking about? Is that what happens as far as the overall E&T margins?","Amy Campbell","Yes. I think when you look at that E&T business, it is such a diversified business, but there are always lots of puts and takes. And if you look at where their operating margins have been delivering, they tend to be pretty consistent, sometimes a little lumpy based on some significant deliveries. But that is a very diversified portfolio I think which I don\u2019t think is really all that significant to put any too much focus on a particular piece of it. You will see lots of movements in any quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Jerry Revich","It\u2019s Goldman Sachs. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about why pricing turned negative in Construction Industries for you folks this quarter? Given where lead times are, input cost inflation, it\u2019s just surprising to see the negative price realization. Maybe you could give us some context on what drove that? And earlier, you folks mentioned that price cost for the company should be neutral to positive in \u201819. Does that imply for Construction Industries specifically?","Amy Campbell","So, for the first, Jerry, as said, Construction Industries is competing in a very competitive market. That said, we are very pleased with their operating margin. In the quarter, they had record quarterly operating profit, and they continue to be focused on growth. Some of the confusion, I think if we step back and clarify it a little bit, and I talked about this a little bit with Joe O\u2019Dea is there is a bit of time lag. So, Construction Industries sales variances are often given at the time -- or given after of the time of sale to customer. They are post-sale sales variances. So, there can be a delay from when we ship a product to the dealer and then when we true up all of those sales variances to the customer. So, that\u2019s a piece of it and that the process of that working through the systems will give us some lag into the back half of the year, we will start to see price realizations from positive in the fourth quarter. I also think if you step back and you look at where second and third quarter price realization was for Construction Industries last year, was very, very favorable and so they are coming off of extremely favorable comps from a year ago.","On the price costs, I think you said we said price cost would be favorable in the 2019. I think to clarify that, we haven\u2019t given any 2019 guidance. But as we step back and look at price assumptions and material cost assumptions, we do expect them to be favorable, both for the full year and in the second half. I think that answers your question.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Thank you, Amy. And then, as you folks laid out on slide 12, your margin performance has been really strong early in the cycle. As we think about the operating and execute plan across the enterprise, how much of the benefit is in the run rate results that we\u2019re seeing now versus what\u2019s in front of us, can we just discuss that conceptually?","Joe Creed","So, I just want to make sure I understand the question. So slide 12 is all historic performance. So, the column in there is trailing 12 months back to July of last year. So, can you clarify your question on\u2026","Jerry Revich","Sure. Yes. So, you are at the high-end or above your mid-cycle margin targets across the segments at sales levels that are in line to below mid-cycle. So, clearly, the margin performance has been really strong so far in the cycle. So, as we think about the operating and execute plan, clearly a big driver of the benefit so far, how big is the opportunity that\u2019s in front of us, as you folks look at those plans across the enterprise?","Joe Creed","Like Jim said, I think the way we would think about that is we\u2019re always trying to improve part of the strategy as operational excellence. And if the sales were to continue to go higher, we would also look to try to have a little more operating leverage. But the heart of the O&E Model is trying to grow our business profitably. So, we\u2019re really focused on also growing. At the same time, there is no one answer; there is a balance that we try to keep in check of growth versus the margin side of things. But, we are really happy with where we\u2019re at right now and feel good about where we\u2019re heading. ","Amy Campbell","And just to clarify, Jerry, because I think there is a fair bit of confusion sometimes about those Investor Day sales ranges. We did not call those mid-cycle sales ranges, we called those achievable sales levels. And so weren\u2019t calling or declaring the cycle. And I think that is causing some confusion about where we are today, and we wanted to talk to you that on slide 11. But I do want to just kind of reiterate that Investor Day was not intended to be operating margins at mid-cycle. It was just to reference an achievable sales level that we\u2019d achieved in the past that we thought would -- could reasonably achieve in the future. So, I just wanted to clarify that point.","All right. And with that, I think that\u2019s going to have to be our last question.","Jim Umpleby","Well, thanks Joe and Amy and thanks to all of you for all your questions. Just to summarize quickly here. We had a great quarter and we\u2019re implementing our strategy and it is working. We\u2019re very proud of our global team\u2019s performance. We feel good about our business and state of our markets. And we\u2019re very pleased to have been able to raise the outlook. And we look forward to talking to all of you next quarter. Thank you for your time.","Joe Creed","Thank you.","Amy Campbell","With that, Kate, I think we\u2019ll end the call.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we'll open the floor for your questions and comments for after the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Thank you very much and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services, and as usual on the call with me this morning we have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman, and our group President and CFO, Brad Halverson. Today I'll start by walking you through a short slide deck similar to what we've done over the past couple of quarters and then we'll move on to the Q&A after that. So if you don't have the slide deck in front of you right now, it's available on our website, caterpillar.com in the Investor section and it's where the webcast link was.","This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Incorporated and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the express written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investor section of our caterpillar.com website and it'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","If you go to page two of this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. In addition to page two of the slide deck, a discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially can also be found in cautionary statements under Item 1A of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release.","In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both the financial release and this presentation can be also be found in the financial release on our website and is also the back page of today's slide deck.","So with that, let's get started on the slide deck and I would ask you to flip over to page four. It's the comparison of second quarter 2016 with the second quarter of 2015. It has the key lines for the second quarter versus last year. Sales and revenues down about $2 billion. About half of that was Energy & Transportation and the other half was split close to evenly between Resource Industries and Construction Industries and I'll talk a little bit more about sales than a minute.","And profit, the primary drivers of the decline in profit from $1.31 to $0.93 a share this quarter, and excluding restructuring, $1.09, down from $1.40, so a $0.31 decline. By far the biggest negative in the quarter was the decline in sales volume and that included negative sales mix as more of the decline was in higher-margin products like oil and gas. Price realization was also a pretty substantial negative in the quarter and that was off $233 million. Now, on the favorable side, below operating profit, other income and expense was a positive $156 million and that was mostly all due to the absence of below operating profit exchange losses from a year ago. An important point I think to note about this second quarter was exchange had actually little impact on the quarter itself.","And then the bottom, the most substantial positive in the quarter from a profit standpoint was cost reduction. Period and variable costs were favorable $670 million versus a year ago. And that just brings up the point here that we've been really focused on execution. That includes the cost reduction but is not exclusively cost reduction. We've improved our market position as well around the world and in particular in China as well.","So let's switch onto the next page, page five. It's a discussion of the sales and revenues. Again, the biggest sales decline in the quarter was in Energy & Transportation, just shy of $1 billion. We've been talking about this for the last, oh, year or so. The decline really started about midyear last year. So this second quarter is kind of the last I think of the big declines that we're going to see particularly related to oil. First to first, second to second, by the time we got to the third quarter and certainly by the time we got to the fourth quarter of last year, it was pretty much all baked in. In fact, I think by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, the comps will be a lot more like the prior year. So this should be the last quarter of declines, at least in this size.","Resource Industries, down about $600 million and most of that decline was lower end user demand and a little bit from pricing. Mining has just continued to be a very challenged industry. Customers are pushing out replacement purchases. They're delaying as much repair as they can and we see that in our sales. Now, relative to the trend, it's about flat with where we were in the first quarter so no continuing deterioration from where we were last quarter, but down from a year ago.","And then finally, Construction Industries down just under $400 million. A little more than half of the decline was price realization and it is a pretty tough pricing environment out there today in construction and we see it everywhere. We see it in the U.S. We see it outside the U.S. Now, a word about this, because I know it may seem to you like it's accelerating but it's kind of not. It started going up about midyear last year, the sales variance, the discounting. And so we had negatives in the second half of last year. The first half of this year is comparing with a better period a year ago so it looks like it's quite a bit of an increase but it's not much of an increase actually from where we've been over the last two or three quarters. And I think as we go on and talk about this in the outlook, we see it starting to flatten out.","Sales were down in North America, Latin America. Europe, Africa, Middle East was pretty flat year-over-year. Europe up, Africa, Middle East down, and sales in Asia were actually up year-over-year despite price pressure.","So that's a quick run through of sales. I know related to Energy & Transportation, there's a lot of concern around the turbine business because it's been pretty strong for quite some time. Just a couple of facts about that. We reported on the backlog last quarter, said it was up slightly from year-end. Second quarter of this year is about spot on where we were at the end of the quarter so we're not seeing any deterioration there. It's a little early to talk about 2017 but all indications are the year is progressing pretty well. Oil is lower, work, backlog, sales around natural gas and natural gas pipelines are still pretty strong. Okay, so that's sales. Let's flip over to page six and talk a little bit about the operating profit change and cost in particular.","This is the waterfall chart that we have actually in the release. No big, new information on here outside of the release. It just highlights how well we've done on cost reduction. So in total between variable and period, or you might call it relatively fixed cost, we're down about $670 million. And that's gone a long way to offset the impact of lower volume and product mix. And you can see on here, price realization, the negative $233 million. And actually, we've had more variable cost reduction if you think material costs and efficiency and that type of thing. We've about offset the impact on price realization with that.","So year-to-date, if we turn to the next page, just talk a little bit about what we've done on costs. So on the first quarter between period costs and variable costs, we were down just under $0.5 billion. This quarter again was $670 million. So through the first half of the year, we've taken over $1.1 billion of cost out. If you look up at the top of this page in the yellow bubble up there, what we're saying is we're on track. Our expectations are that we'll end this year with well over $2 billion of cost reduction.","That's coming really in three sort of general buckets. The most significant is restructuring and that is everything from combining office functions and reducing people to taking out manufacturing floor space and related costs. Material costs have also been favorable and we've had a good track record on material costs over the past few years. We're down over $1 billion over the last few years and it really comes from mostly design and sourcing-related cost reduction and then important, but to a lesser degree, commodity-related cost reduction.","And then everything else. It's everything from a bit lower short-term incentive pay based on lower results and then cost reductions throughout the company, everyplace we can find it, from everything from travel and entertainment expense to consulting spend. So wherever we can take money out, we're working really hard to do that.","So, bottom line, we're investing in the things we need to for the future, things like digital and really important product programs. Everything else, we're really trying to put a lid on and cut where we can, and the results have actually been pretty good.","Let's flip over to the next page. That would be page eight. Talk a little bit about the outlook for the year. When we were sitting here a quarter ago, we were expecting sales in a range of $40 billion to $42 billion, so $41 billion as a midpoint. We've taken that down, from midpoint to midpoint, about $0.75 billion. And the gist of that is just everything that we're seeing in the economy today around the world. Additional risk; everything from the results of the Brexit vote and the short-term uncertainty that that causes, the trouble we've seen in Turkey, all the negative rhetoric around the U.S. elections. Oil prices have come off a little over the last couple of months. It's not any one thing, I would say. And we said this in the outlook. You know, we have sluggish economic growth throughout the world in general, but not enough to drive growth in our end markets. And the news we've seen over the last few months is definitely not giving us more confidence.","So the outlook for profit is $2.75 a share and that's all-in, excluding restructuring costs, which are going to be about $700 million now this year. Net of that, we're at about $3.55 a share. Both on the top line and the bottom line, our estimate is actually pretty close to the last consensus analyst estimates that we've seen. So we're pretty close to we think where the market is.","Now, one point about this outlook, and this is in Q&A 11 in our release on page 15, it has been negatively affected about $0.08 a share by taxes. So if we hadn't made the change in how we're looking at taxes on our profit excluding restructuring costs, the outlook would've been $0.08 higher, which isn't too bad a performance considering a $750 million decline in the top line. And I think it just goes back to the main theme of execution, cost reduction, doing everything we possibly can to keep the company strong and give us the ability to invest in the future.","One last point I'll make about sales, and this might well be on your minds as well, and that's status of dealer inventory. We're pretty flat right now in dealer inventory with year-end last year but we think it's going to come down quite a bit over the next two quarters, and that's not entirely unusual. Last year we had a reduction as well. Full-year reduction in dealer inventory this year is probably going to be not quite but close to double what we did last year.","And it's not so much \u2013 and you've asked this question before: do we have a glut of inventory? And I certainly would not describe it as that. I think one of the things that's happening out there is a little bit of our own doing and it's around lean. If you look at our delivery performance and the stability of our delivery performance to dealers, it's actually improved quite a bit over the last five years. We're to the point now where dealers, we think, have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver what they need and when they need it. And we think that's causing them to both order less, so as our delivery times have come down in Construction, our backlog comes down a little. Think of it this way. This is an oversimplified example, but if we had delivery times that were one day, we wouldn't have much backlog. Dealers would order and we would ship it.","So I think one of the reason the Construction backlog is a little lower and one of the reason that we're getting probably more aggressive dealer inventory declines is how well we're performing on lean relative to delivery performance. We knew that was likely to happen, and in the scheme of things, it's a good thing.","So, let's move on to the outlook. Let's move onto the next page and that's \u2013 I think it's probably a good time to talk about first half versus second half. You know, we're through half of the year. Probably time to reflect a little bit on how the second half of the year is likely to shape up.","End user demand should be a fair bit higher than the first half of the year. We have our sales, which we think are going to be $600 million to $700 million higher than the first half, and that does include some substantial dealer inventory reduction. And we have profit per share excluding restructuring costs up $0.09. With restructuring, it's down a little and that's because of the extra cost for restructuring in the back half.","So if you look at how the sales shape up, that $0.65 billion increase in sales, Construction Industries is likely to be down a little bit. End user demand pretty flat, but because of dealer inventory reductions, their sales are likely to be a bit down. That's our forecast anyway. Resource Industries just slightly up from the first half run rate, and not a lot, no big changes there in terms of trends. And then Energy & Transportation is responsible essentially for the increase in sales and that is mostly seasonal pattern on some of the big project kind of sales that we have, turbines for example. And we expect a bit more sales out of rail in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.","In terms of profit, we have the $0.09 a share better profit in the second half of the year than the first half and the higher sales volume is the most significant reason for that. Pricing, let's talk about this, and I touched on it a minute ago. On a year-over-year basis, the negative impact of pricing ought to start easing a little bit and that's because we really saw it kick up midyear last year. And first half versus second half though, forget about last year, we don't see much change in the pricing environment.","Inventory cost absorption will be a modest negative in the back half of the year. We're looking at taking inventory down $500 million or $600 million \u2013 our own inventory not dealer inventory \u2013 down $500 million or $600 million in the back half of the year. Be a little hit to profit, but positive for cash flow. We also had some sale of security gains in the second quarter for Financial Services (sic) [Products] division and for the insurance portion of that and we're not expecting that to repeat in the second half.","Cost overall we think will be fairly neutral first half to second half. We do have additional period cost reduction that we're looking at in the second half of the year, but with low seasonal cost in the first quarter, and probably a little bit of efficiency negatives, production is going to come down because of the decline in dealer inventory. We think those will come close to offsetting during the second half of the year.","Now, we don't actually have an outlook for the third quarter but if you think about the second half of the year, in a lot of ways I think it'll look similar to the first half of the year. And if you think to the first half of the year, we had a low first quarter and a pretty good second quarter. And I think as we look at the rest of the year, the third and fourth quarter will play out similarly. We'll have probably a weak third quarter and a much better fourth quarter. And again, a lot of that is the timing of some of this E&T sales around larger projects.","So we're thinking that third quarter will probably be $400 million or $500 million in sales better than the first quarter and profit will be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 a share better than the first quarter. And then the fourth quarter will look a lot like second quarter. Sales slightly higher, profit about the same as Q2. So that's how we think the rest of the year will shape up.","So let's move on to the last slide that I'm going to cover today. That's slide 10 and that's key discussion points. Just a little quick recap of much of what I've talked about. On balance, there's not much change in demand from the industries that we're serving. Construction demand is relatively steady but with continuing price pressure. We have no clear signs of recovery in mining or oil and gas or rail for that matter.","Good operational performance continues. Overall, our market position has improved. And that's been a continuing story for most of the last five years. Our decremental margins are pretty good and better than our target range, and that's despite a pretty negative sales mix second quarter to second quarter.","Cost reduction, a substantial $1.1 billion year to date, and we're thinking over $2 billion for the full year. We're on track with our restructuring actions. They've contributed to cost reduction this year, and that'll contribute to more in 2017.","And then finally, our balance sheet's strong and that's very important to us because maintaining our credit rating and the dividend are very high priorities for us. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $1.2 billion. Our debt to cap ratio for machinery, Energy & Transportation business was 39%. About 21% net of about $6.8 billion of cash that we had on hand at the end of the quarter.","So that's a wrap-up. We're now ready to move into the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question is coming from Ross Gilardi. Ross, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and post your question.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hi. Bank of America. Thank you. Mike, some of your competitors sound maybe a little bit more sanguine on stabilization in the mining markets, at least in the aftermarket. And there just seems to be some scattered new project activity around the world. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing? Is there any chance you're losing any share right now?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yeah. I would say there's some improvement in mining on the horizon around aftermarket. We are seeing a little more activity on dealer rebuilds and we would hope that that would translate into higher sales for us. I think one of the things that might distinguish us a little bit from competitors is that we sell through dealers. So a lot of these projects might hit them quicker than they hit us. We're still expecting a decline in dealer inventory this year and particularly in the second half of the year. So if we were just selling to end user demand, sales would be a bit better than they are right now.","So yeah, I don't want to sound totally negative. It doesn't look to us like it's continuing to go down and there are a few small signs like that, particularly like the rebuild activity that's a little positive. But we track share of what's being sold and we're not seeing deterioration there. So it'd be nice if it would improve a lot quicker and hopefully somewhere down the road, it will.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And can you just comment on the impact of lower interest rates on your pension and provide any preliminary thoughts on cash outflows into the pension next year to the extent you can?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yeah. I'll try not to get too far in front of myself, but I think, based on where we sit now, we don't see the requirement for substantial increases in contributions next year. The number I think is less than $0.5 billion, if memory serves me.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Seth Weber. Seth, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning. It's RBC. Mike, you mentioned a couple times in the release, there were comments about the U.S. construction equipment supply demand imbalance. Can you comment on where you think we are in the process of that smoothing out? Does equipment continue to need to be moved out of the energy markets? Where are we from an absorption perspective? Thank you.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yeah, so as we sit now, the thing that's been pretty good is sales that go directly to end users rather than through a rental fleet. So the weakness right now is, mostly what we've seen is in and around our dealers loading rental fleets. And I think that's where this sort of hangover of equipment that was being used for oil and gas, a lot of it resides right now. They're pretty stocked up on rental fleets. Used prices are down a bit, so that's not encouraging them to sell used equipment out of a rental fleet and replace it with new. I think that's, right now, the reason that we're not seeing a more positive construction number in the U.S. You know, you would hope \u2013 time heals all things and you would hope here sometime over the next couple of quarters that we'd be through that.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the Chinese construction equipment market. The numbers there have been probably \u2013 I think you talked a little bit more positively there last quarter. Any updated thoughts on what you're seeing in that market?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yeah. Thankfully it's not another down year there. It's sort of flattish there for the full year, up for the industry. We're doing a little better than the industry. That's continuing a trend that's been going on now for a couple of years. We've got great product, great dealer distribution there. I think customers are coming around to the quality business model. So again, hopefully next year can build on this. We'll have to wait and see. But at least for this year, we're looking for, from an industry standpoint, a flattish industry.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Adam Uhlman. Adam, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. It's Cleveland Research. I guess, back to the second half outlook for the year, I'm a little surprised that the profits aren't going to be up more than the forecast sales increase. So I guess, Mike, you touched on some of the factors that are behind that. Could you talk to what you're seeing in material costs? And how do you expect that to play out as we go into 2017 with steel prices moving higher?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yeah. That's actually a great question and I'm remiss for not having mentioned that when I talked about the second half. So we've had good cost reduction during the first half of the year for material. And our view is we'll continue to have cost reduction in the second half of the year versus 2015. But commodity prices have come up a little, so we're probably going to have less than the first half of the year. So in other words, full year, even second half versus the second half of last year positive, but the positiveness has probably peaked and it'll probably go down a little bit in the second half of the year. So that is one of the reasons, I think, that second half profitability, that plus the inventory declines plus the absence of the $0.04 we got on the securities sale in the second quarter all make it look like it doesn't hang together first half, second half with sales.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Got you. And related to the mining business, I was wondering if you could just talk about high level, how you folks see the industry changing, if at all, related to the Komatsu and Joy Global merger?","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll take that one. It's Doug Oberhelman here. I don't think it was any surprise that Joy was acquired with what's happened to them and the mining industry in general and all the mining customers, particularly coal customers, that are out there around the world. Obviously, we've known Komatsu for decades. We've known Joy intimately as well the last decade or so since they emerged from bankruptcy and we entered mining in a bigger way. So neither one of these are new players. Certainly it's a consolidation that makes sense in the mining world. It's going to be smaller for at least a period of time. And, again, we know them, they know us, and I think going forward, we'll continue the competition just as we have in the past and I expect us to continue winning where we win.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from David Raso. David, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Evercore ISI. Just trying to think about the carryover cost savings of 2016 to 2017. And then second question about the orders continue to fall sequentially, and I can appreciate some of the seasonality in rail for second half versus first half, but just thinking about the exit rate exiting 2016 to 2017. Can you help us a bit where you see orders playing out from here? Have orders stabilized? Because obviously they continue to fall sequentially.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yeah, I think no doubt about that and it's particularly in construction. Part of that, as you mentioned, is seasonal. And I think part of that again is related to dealers taking inventory down during the second half of this year. Again, partly seasonal. I think partly delivery performance. We're doing a much better job of delivering on time, stably to customers. So I think both of those things are contributing to lower orders. If you look at end user demand, I'm talking construction here, for the second half of the year, our sales to users, that's going to be pretty steady in the second half of the year. So it's not as though we're seeing a deterioration in demand from end users. It's more dealers have lowered orders to take out some more inventory.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","So if you exit the year with an order run rate annualized below 2016, you're saying don't necessarily imply down revenues in 2017. You just feel your shipping capabilities are allowing a lower order rate, so to speak.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yes. Yes. Yes.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Like a quicker turn of the backlog and the revenues?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yeah, I think that is exactly what we're saying.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think that's a fair assumption. The retail sales numbers are the one to watch and really drive this whole supply chain. And as long as they're steady, the chain will work itself out. And as Mike said, second half will look different than the first, but that's the one that really drives us. Of course, that gets back to market share and a lot of other things as well, David.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Well, do you expect to see the retail sales get flat by the end of the year so we feel more comfortable about that assumption for 2017?","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know if they'll be flat flat, but they should be closer than they are right now, yeah.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","And then the carryover cost, the slide number seven, when you say on track for over $2 billion. I'm not sure if that's an annualized number but assuming it's a $2 billion run rate exiting the year, looking how the quarters play out, or really first quarter, second quarter, second half, are you implying a carryover cost savings of $1 billion?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","So that's 2016 versus 2015 costs. And we start \u2013 a lot of that started coming out very early in 2016. Our first quarter was quite favorable. Our second quarter was even more favorable. So I think we will probably end the year with, as you look forward based on the timing of the cost reduction, a tailwind, but I don't think it would be $1 billion.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jamie Cook. Jamie, please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Credit Suisse. Couple clarifications. One, Mike, in the press release and I think in your commentary you implied Solar was flat with the first quarter, up from the beginning of the year, but you also talked about some customers pushing out orders into 2017. So I'm just wondering, is the backlog flat because of push-outs, or are you actually seeing order activity? And then my second question is for Doug. Doug, you've talked historically about managing to a targeted $3.50 trough-ish EPS. As we sit here today, given the markets don't seem to be getting better, we're already at the $3.55 this year. Is that off the table? Or do you think there are incremental levers that you could pull to manage profitability as we think out over the next 12 months?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","I'll start with that on the Solar piece and then I'll turn it over to Doug. On Solar, what we see customers pushing out a little bit is the timing of some maintenance and that doesn't have usually as long a backlog as the new product. So probably impacts this year's sales a little quicker than it does backlog just by the nature of it. I think the reason that we made a comment on Solar backlog is because everybody's concerned about it and we're just trying to reassure everyone that what they're selling, they're replacing with new orders. That's not fallen off a cliff or off the table, and the gas business just keeps on chunking along. So I'll turn it over to Doug.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks. In terms of your trough earnings question, I think your questions are reasonable one to assume. As you say, without all the restructuring costs, we're at $3.55 and, as Mike said, you take $0.08 back, we're a little bit above that even but certainly around $40 billion, where we are now. That's a reasonable assumption to go after and that's where we're going to fight to try and find a bottom if that's what we're fighting in the future.","Bradley M. Halverson - Chief Financial Officer & Group President","This is Brad Halverson. I might just add a quick point, Doug. The trough earnings number has been stated between $2.50 and $3.50. I'd say if you look at how \u2013 and I would say the sales decline modeled in those scenarios would not have been as severe as what we've experienced in the four-year trend. Going from above $60 billion down to $40 billion, we've been absolutely trying to stay ahead of the process to be prepared if things did not get better. If we were not staying ahead, quite frankly, there was no way we could have done $2 billion of cost reduction this year to offset some of the price pressures and the drop in volume.","And we really like our midcycle numbers. Everybody wants to know when we're going to start recovering in that trend towards midcycle. But we still need to be prepared for what could happen in the short term on the downside. And so we've talked about a 25% to 30% decrementals. I would say we're still committed to that. I would also say that we're being extremely directive in the things that we fund, things like digital which will be up significantly this year over last year. Things like funding the businesses that we believe have the highest opportunity to improve the value of the company and our operating profit after capital charge, which we call OPACC, in the medium term. So we want to fund those industries which we think are attractive for us and where we play well. And things that are not as attractive are the places that we look first to cut. So we're still in that process and we're still preparing to stay ahead of the game and I would say that, if required, we would be ready.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's right, Brad, and I would just come back to the incremental\/decrement pull-throughs on the way up and the way down that have served us pretty well going back to 2009 on the way up from $30 billion to $66 billion, and then on the way down from $66 billion to $40.25 billion this year. We've managed to stay inside of those targets all the way up and down. And I think that's probably one of the single biggest differences we've been able to accomplish from prior deep slowdowns in the 40% range top line is we've got everybody targeting those and that's where we go after with our cost reductions. And, as Brad said, our capital allocations then in those businesses we really want to stay in and thrive in long term.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jerry Revich. Jerry, please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, everyone. It's Goldman Sachs. Mike, you spoke about roughly $2 billion or so in implied dealer inventory reductions, which I think is mostly in the back half of this year. Could you just give us a flavor for the mix between Construction and Resources and any regional color that you can give us where you expect inventories to come down? And as we enter 2017, do you think we're at normalized dealer inventory levels for the current demand environment?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","So, couple of things. One, $2 billion is a little too high a number. It's probably more like year-over-year $1.5 billion and it's probably split two-thirds Construction, one-third Resource, and that's sort of ballpark. And in terms of adequate levels, I tried to address this point. I think adequate levels is a little bit of a moving target around delivery performance. So again, if we were able to cut delivery performance in half from where it's at now, dealers would feel comfortable holding less inventory.","If our delivery \u2013 let's say things ticked up, orders ticked up, the markets heated up, and let's say we had trouble keeping up, that would concern dealers and they would order even more. They would want to hold even more. But just the opposite is happening right now. We have excellent delivery performance. They can get pretty much what they need when their customers need it. And so that's causing them to hold, or want to hold less. And the more \u2013 the better we do with lean, the more that'll probably be the case. So I'm trying to stress the point I don't think dealer inventories are excessive. I mean, there's a reasonable range but I think they will come down over the second half of the year.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And you was talking about the major restructuring changes as we think about the eventual recovery. Can you update us on how you're thinking about incremental margins and recovery given the change in the manufacturing footprint?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Well, it should be \u2013 and Doug has talked about this quite a bit \u2013 on the way up. We previously had a 25% incremental target but I think, while we've not quantified it, certainly our expectation is that the first chunk of what goes up would certainly be at a higher rate than that.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Robert, please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","It's Barclays Bank. Thank you. Construction margins are really quite impressive given negative pricing and given volumes that are troughing in LatAm and maybe low cycle elsewhere. Can you see steep falls from here or do you think that's bottoming? And I'm curious if you have any view or are willing to share any view rather on structural margin upside, if you actually get a healthy market given what you're doing at low cycle.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yeah, that's a good question. I think our Construction business is a great example of how our managing for maximum OPACC, operating profit less a capital charge, can work. They've been on this path to maximize OPACC for last few years, which is fundamentally around figuring out where you make the most money and where you don't, fixing where you don't and reinvesting in where you do to increase sales. So, that's oversimplification of it. But that's worked.","They've also taken out \u2013 they're very cost-conscious. They've taken out costs. But relative to where we think a trough, a midcycle, a peak would be, they're not as bad off as, say, oil or rail or mining. But I think there's plenty of upside for them. North America is still well below the peak. Brazil is \u2013 wow \u2013 so far down you can hardly see it. So, I think there's plenty of scope for improvement and based on the work that these guys have done to figure out where to invest to drive OPACC, I think there's still plenty of upside left for them.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Do you see signs of stabilization in North American Construction? As you said, we're well below the prior peak and some of the fleet's older. Do you think there's material downside chances there? Or are you seeing stable?","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't see material downside at the moment, frankly. We've seen so many states step up with bond issues. We've seen many states step up with tax increases for infrastructure spending. Anecdotally, a lot of our customers are busy across the country. A 2% growth rate of the 1.5% to 2% does not spur a lot of investment but there's enough going on to tell me that we're not facing a cliff here unless there's some outside event of some kind that occurs. So I don't see it collapsing or, as you said, a big falloff. I would sure like to see the growth increase based on increased economic negative activity.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Doug and Mike.","Bradley M. Halverson - Chief Financial Officer & Group President","This is Brad. I'll just make one other comment. And we're not going to give you an incremental number this year to plot in. We've talked about it being fairly high. One thing I would say for reference is that the vast majority of costs we've taken out we would not add back. An so, as we've restructured, as we've changed things, if you think that there are costs that we're ready to add back that we've taken out, I would say outside of some very minor amounts, most of those costs we're not going to add back. So as we add period cost in an upturn relative to our incrementals, it would be focused really around our OPACC improvement agendas, those places we want to invest more because we think there's a significant amount of value. And so that'll probably drive that incremental discussion when we get to that point.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Brad.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Timothy Thein. Timothy, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Citigroup. So the first is on the energy part of E&T and I guess specifically in well servicing where I'd think you would see a recovery first in a more stable oil price environment. So the question just revolves around where the service companies that you and your dealers speak to, where they sit from a sentiment standpoint on CapEx. There's been some comments of some restocking of consumables. But just curious what you're seeing out there.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yeah, I think probably the best way to say that is where oil prices are today is probably not enough to drive a lot of incremental investment there. I think the thing you'll see first is the idle fleets being put back to work, particularly around drilling, before we see some investment. So oil prices this morning, I guess, were in the $42-plus range. We're probably still a ways away from that.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And maybe a second one on Cat Financial. I don't know if Brad's still around. But the question relates to the penetration rate in the quarter. I think new retail financing has now eclipsed 30%. It hasn't been there, I don't think, post the financial crisis. So I'm wondering is that a shift in the underlying business mix that's driving that, or is that perhaps more of a strategy shift for Cat? Or maybe you could just speak to that. Thank you.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yeah. This is Mike. So Cat Financial is always trying to increase their share. Just like every other part of our business, they're trying to increase their market share, if you will, the percentage of deals that they do versus their competitors. And they've actually done a very good job over the last couple of years in increasing that, and I think that's what you're seeing. The limit on that is you certainly don't want to do shaky deals. You don't want to sacrifice credit quality to do it, but you want to work very closely with the dealers, with the customers, and capture as much market share as you can.","Bradley M. Halverson - Chief Financial Officer & Group President","Yeah, and this is Brad. I'll add onto that. We're very proud of the people at Cat Financial and how they run that business very independently in partnership with our product groups, but very independently. And so you'll see our allowance being very well maintained at around 1.25%. Our past dues, similar trend at 2.93%, fairly close to previous quarter and below historical average. And we have grown our share there.","But one thing I want to comment on, which we had a few questions come in on, there is pressure in the used equipment market. It's probably down 2% or 3% from the last quarter. It's probably down 5% to 10% if you look from a year ago. We carry a little over $600 million of used equipment, both from repossessions and residuals. Still pretty well behaved. We had a gain last year and we had a very small loss this quarter, and so we don't see any big issues in that regard. But I would tell you that that is an area that does have some pressure and that we're watching, but it's, at this point, very well maintained.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Steven Fisher. Steven, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. It's UBS. Just a question on the restructuring. How anticipatory would you say is the incremental $150 million in the quarter versus just reflecting what current conditions warrant? In other words, you talked in your question eight in the back about too early to really say what impact Brexit would have, but would this incremental restructuring be intended to mitigate a potential slowdown from the UK Brexit and a potential slowing in U.S. non-res construction activity? Or would you might want to do more restructuring if those things play out?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","So that's a good question. I wouldn't relate it specifically to any one of those. I think you have to look at it in the aggregate. And Brad made actually a really important point a couple of minutes ago and that's that we are trying to get \u2013 we don't have a crystal ball. We don't know what's going to happen in the marketplace. But we want to be positioned to deal with it if it does happen. So I would say that over the course of the past quarter, we're a little more negative on the world economy and the Brexit, the Turkey, the elections, oil price, you name it, all of that contributes. And we're less bullish on second half sales because of that. And whatever impact that would have in the future, we're trying to get ahead of that with additional cost reduction. So I would say it's us trying to get ahead of the potential, not what we actually know, and not specifically related to any one of those items.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful, Mike. And then in terms of mining profitability, the $163 million loss was a step down in the quarter compared to Q1. How are you thinking about where that goes from here? How contained can your restructuring actions keep those losses going forward?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Yeah. Hopefully, this is the worst quarter we'll see. I think embedded within our outlook we see it getting a little bit better. Second quarter pricewise was deteriorated a little bit from the first quarter. And when you get to numbers as we're talking a change quarter to quarter of a couple hundred million, not for pricing but in total for them. Costs were a little higher because of some inventory adjustments. Just normal surplus and excess inventory.","And then we had a little negative inventory absorption for RI. They took out inventory in the second quarter. That hurt a little bit. They are certainly a part of the extra cost reduction that we're going after in the second half of the year. When I talked a little bit about first half\/second half, we think their sales are going to be up a little bit in the second half of the year. So I think the combination of extra cost reduction and a few more sales hopefully will make the second quarter the worst of the year.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Please note your affiliation and pose your question.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. It's Jefferies. Hey, Doug, I'm going to take you up on this since you mentioned infrastructure trends getting a little bit better. How big of an opportunity is that for Cat? How much of revenue might that be? Or how should we think about sizing that going forward?","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's hard to tell, actually. The highway bill, the Federal Transportation Act that was passed last year in itself did not increase overall funding an awful lot in this country. It held it at inflation plus a little bit, but it did give it five years. I think as most states have recovered from their fiscal problems the last few years, they're starting to recognize the needs for infrastructure and we're seeing that. If there's any impact \u2013 and I've said this all year long \u2013 from that transportation act of last year, it's going to be a 2017 event. We might feel it. I don't think it would move the needle a great deal, but we would certainly feel it. And it's hard to quantify until states start lining up for their matching funds. So there's quite a big effort underway to get that done as well. We'll just have to see it play out. It's certainly going to be a positive, but I would doubt we'd see it move the needle in a big way in 2017 but we'd feel it.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then Mike, maybe just a couple quick modeling questions. How do we think about taxes going forward with the various changes you've had? And then, what's a normal level of short-term incentive compensation if we're thinking into the out years?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Two good questions, Steve. First on taxes, all-in, we're looking at a 25% tax rate this year but that is a little lower because of all the restructuring, which has tended to be in a little higher tax jurisdictions. So the restructuring is attracting somewhere around I think low 30%s, 34% I think. So excluding restructuring, it'll vary a little bit by quarter depending upon how much restructuring there is, but probably around 27% excluding restructuring. And then, what's normal on incentive pay, I'm going to qualify it a little bit here. It depends on how many employees we have because it scales, if you look at it in terms of dollars. But based on the number of employees we have right now, if we were to pay everyone at a 1.0 payout, which we would consider to be normal in a normal year, you're looking at something in the order of magnitude of, let's say, rough number $850 million.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Super. That's great. Thanks.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Joe O'Dea. Joe, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. It's Vertical Research. First question, just on the rail side. It sounded like from a geographic standpoint that the softness that you would've seen year-over-year was more international. But could you just give a little bit of commentary on what the North America trends are like for you? Incremental softness, with North America rail flat year-over-year, just how stable you think that is when you start to think about more downside risk, upside risk, and how stable those North America trends are.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Joe, I feel little bad here. I tried to prep a little on rail but I didn't do it by region. So can't talk too much about North America specific. Sorry I'm just not further up to speed. But what I would say is we're looking for a better rail sales in the back half of this year. Remember, we've just introduced our new locomotive at midyear and while sales aren't huge for that right now given the state of the overall industry, we certainly are going to sell some. So that's part of the increase in the back half of the year.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then on Resources, it seemed like in the first quarter one of the challenges was aftermarket came in a little lighter than we would've expected to start off the year, with the expectation that moving deeper into 2016, that would improve. From a margin standpoint, it didn't look like there was a mix benefit in the second quarter. Could you just talk about sequential trends, what you're hearing from dealers to scheduled rebuilds? It sounds like that's a little bit better. Did you see some improvement in aftermarket from first quarter to second quarter?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","Well, we're hearing that dealers are booking a little bit more. In fact, I verified that with our mining group last night. They are seeing \u2013 dealers are seeing an uptick of bookings around rebuild. It hasn't really hit our parts business quite yet but hopefully it will. And your synopsis of no big upturn in part sales around mining is actually correct. At least so far.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division","All righty. Well, I think we're at the top of the hour here, actually a minute or so over, so we'll conclude the call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation."],"4523":["Caterpillar Inc.

And welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Result Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. The floor will be open for your questions and comments following the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Mike DeWalt","Thank you very much, Dana, and good morning, and welcome everyone to our first quarter earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services. And on the call today, I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.","Remember this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website, it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","This morning we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information.","A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2015 and it\u2019s also in our forward-looking statements language in today\u2019s financial release.","In addition, there is a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can also be found in this morning\u2019s release and again, it\u2019s posted at caterpillar.com.","Okay, with that let's get started. This morning we'll be reviewing financial results for the first and our revised outlook for 2015. Then there about three points that I\u2019d like to start with actually before we get into the details.","And the first is that from a macro standpoint, in our view not much has changed since our last earnings conference call in January. So we are staying pretty focused on the things that we do have some control of and that\u2019s execution and operational improvement, things like safety, quality, market share, efficiency, cost control, inventory turns and cash flow, and we continue to make progress.","And that brings me to my second point. Given the environment we are in we were pleased with our first quarter results. Sales in the quarter were pretty close to what we expected and we were pleased with the bottomline.","And that brings me to my third point, and that\u2019s a reminder of what we said in our year end conference call back in January. We said that, we expected the year to start out stronger than it would end and that\u2019s still what we expect, and that\u2019s probably evident to you if you consider our first quarter actual results and what we are expecting for the first year.","Okay, with those three points, let\u2019s get into the quarter. Sales and revenues were $12.7 billion and that was about 4% less than the $13.2 billion that we had in the first quarter last year, $342 million of that decline in sales was a result of the stronger dollar, and sales volume was unfavorable $295 million. Those two items were partially offset by a small improvement in price realization that was $105 million, definitely in the right direction but less than 1%.","Now the only region in the world that was up was North America and that was up 9%. The North American improvement was pretty much across the Board in each of our -- with each of our segment being in positive territory.","Outside of North America that wasn't the case and sales in each of our segments were down in Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East and in the Asia-Pacific region. In total sales and revenues were off 18% in Latin America and sales of all of our Equipment segments that\u2019s resource industries, construction industries, and energy and transportation were down double digits.","Construction was off 23% and a sizable portion of that with the absence of a large order from the Brazilian Government that we had in the first quarter last year and weaker construction activity in general in the region particular, Brazil.","Resource industries was also down 23% in Latin America, reflecting continuing weakness in mining and that's pretty much the case in every region. And energy and transportation was down 11%.","Sales and revenues in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region were down 12%. Construction industries was off 14% and most of that was from less favorable dealer inventory changes and the impact of currency on our sales. Resource industries was also up 14%, again weak mining and energy and transportation was down 8%.","Sales and revenues in Asia Pacific were down 13% with the most significant decline in construction industries at 21%. Construction industries were down substantially in China and lower in Japan as a result of the stronger dollar versus the yen. Our sales in Japan which are in yen essentially translated into fewer dollars.","Okay, that's a recap of sales. Profit per share though was higher in the first quarter than it was in the first quarter a year ago. This year it was $1.81 per share, a year ago in the first quarter it was a $1.44 a share.","Now we had restructuring costs in both quarters, in the first quarter of last year, we had $0.17 per share of restructure costs and that was mostly from the actions that we took in our European operations. This year we had $0.05 per share of restructuring costs in the first quarter.","So excluding restructuring profit per share improved from a $1.61 a year ago to a $1.86 in the current quarter -- the first quarter. Now the primary reasons profit per share was up, number one was the $120 million gain that we had from the sale of our remaining ownership in what was our third-party logistics business.","We also had, as I mentioned a minute ago, $105 million of positive price realization and we had $77 million of favorable currency impacts that helped operating profit. I am just going to stop there for a minute and chat about currency.","It's a subject that for us seems to be frequently misunderstood not just like to clarify things again. We do have substantial sales that are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. And where the dollar strengthened that causes those sales to translate into fewer dollars not the negative for our topline.","That said, we also have substantial manufacturing operations and we saw substantial purchase materials outside the U.S., so lot of factories outside the U.S. and lot of sourcing outside the U.S.","That results in lower costs when translated to U.S. dollars. That's exactly what happened this quarter. Sales translated into fewer dollars, as I mentioned a little bit ago, $342 million fewer. However, the impact on costs was favorable $419 million and the net to operating profit was positive $77 million.","While we are not 100% exactly balanced in our currency exposures, we do have reasonably offsetting sales and cost positions that usually keep the profit impact of exchange rate swings to a reasonably manageable level.","Okay, that's the story on currency I will kind of get back to profit now. I'd already talked about the positive items and offsetting those positives for the quarter, we did have lower sales volume and that was negative to our operating profit about $83 million and we had higher costs.","The most significant cost factor was a change in the timing of expense related to the vesting of stock-based compensation. The timing change won't have an impact on the full-year versus 2014, but it did add to cost in the first quarter.","Okay, that's a quick run through of profit versus the first quarter last year. Let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Machinery, energy and transportation operating cash flow was a little over a $1 billion in the quarter, but that was about $800 million lower than the first quarter last year, and most of that decline came from higher incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of this year and they are based on performance in 2014.","We used about $400 million of cash in the quarter to repurchase shares and with relatively modest needs for CapEx this year. We currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in 2015.","And as you might expect, the timing and the amount that we ultimately repurchase, well that will be subject to business and market conditions as we progress through the year and on our cash deployment priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 37.1%. That's about right in the middle of our targeted 30% to 45% range and it was slightly favorable versus year-end 2014. If you net cash with the debt, our net debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 18.3%.","Now before we get into the revised outlook, I\u2019ll just recap changes in the order backlog over the last quarter because I suspect many of you are interested in that. We ended the first quarter with an order backlog of $16.5 billion, that's about $800 million lower than the year end 2014. The decline was split between construction industries and resource industries. You might have expected that energy and transportation would've also declined from year-end as a result of weakness in the oil industry. It was in total however about flat. We did have a decline in the backlog because of weakness in oil but that was about offset by the increase in the backlog for locomotives.","Okay, with that let me go through the 2015 outlook. As I started out in terms of overall world economic growth, we don't expect much change from the outlook that we provided with our year-end results in January and the same goes for our sales and revenues. We\u2019re holding it at about $50 billion for 2015.","Now while we\u2019re not changing the sales outlook, just as a reminder, we do expect 2015 to be over $5 billion lower than 2014. And as we said last January and I'll reiterate today, the impact of substantially lower oil prices is the most significant reason for the decline. And we still think the most significant impact from oil will be from engines and other equipment that we sell for drilling and well servicing and that\u2019s a spot where we expect a large drop in demand this year.","We've already started to see the impact of that in our order backlog as new orders have not kept pace with sales and the backlog has declined and we\u2019ll start seeing that hit sales over the course of 2015. We also expect that indirect expense -- FX from substantially lower oil prices will be negative in 2015 versus 2014.","In countries and in some regions of the U.S. where oil production is significant for either government receipts or for the local economies, it will likely be negative for sales of construction equipment and for electric power generation business. In some cases, it can be fairly direct like building the road to service the new well or it can be very indirect like construction spending in the country where the government relies on oil revenue to fund spending.","Because many of those construction-related impacts are indirect, it does make it tough to measure. But anecdotally, we believe we are already starting to see the impacts of that in our construction business. In addition to oil, there are several other factors that are contributing to the year-over-year decline in sales. The stronger dollar is a headwind to sales but again not profit. Commodity prices in mining are generally weak particularly iron ore and coal and that's negative for mining in our resource industry segment.","If weaknesses in agriculture, we\u2019re expecting lower sales of industrial engines and we expect our rail business to be down in 2015, after a great year in 2014. And we expect weakness in the construction industries of key developing countries like China and Brazil and that was certainly evident in our first quarter.","So that's a recap of our year-over-year changes, down from 2014 but no change in the topline outlook for 2015. We did raise the profit outlook again this morning. Our previous outlook was $4.60 per share, all in and $4.75 excluding restructuring costs. This morning we raise the profit outlook to $4.70 per share, all in and $5 per share excluding restructuring costs.","Now the changes from the previous outlook include more restructuring activity. We've increased our restructuring cost estimate from about $150 million expected for this year, up $100 million to about $250 million, with almost all the increase related to facilities that produce mining products.","We added the $120 million gain in the first quarter on the sale of our remaining ownership of the third-party logistics business that wasn't in our previous outlook. And based on our first quarter actual results, we made some additional improvements to the profit outlook. While we held the topline and made a modest improvement to the bottom line of our outlook, 2015 is still shaping up to be uncertain and challenging year.","There continues to be softness in Latin America, particularly Brazil. China growth is concerning. There is a bit stability in the scale of economic recovery in the United States remains concerning. Europe is still a question mark. Mining hasn\u2019t shown improvement yet and while we\u2019re still planning a sharp decline in our oil related sales in 2015, we are still a concern around that.","So to wrap up and move on the Q&A portion of the call, sales and revenues in the first quarter were about as we expected and we had a solid profit quarter. We repurchased 400 million of shares in the quarter, the balance sheet remains strong and we\u2019re very focused on operational performance and cost control. But it still looks like a tough year and we've not seen meaningful signs of recovery in many of our cyclical businesses.","So with that, we\u2019re ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I'm showing our first question coming from Ted Grace. Sir, your line is live.","Ted Grace","Hey guys, congratulations on the quarter.","Doug Oberhelman","Thank you.","Ted Grace","Two questions on guidance. The first on revenue. Mike, I know you said you're reaffirming at $50 billion. Last quarter you walked through expectations for Construction Industries and Resource Industries and E&T. I was just wondering if you're reaffirming each of those or have there been any tweaks across the business segment at the revenue level?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. No, I would say by and large, it looks pretty close to what we said at the end of the year.","Ted Grace","Okay, that's helpful. And the related question would be on the EPS side, you raised guidance $0.25. I know you mentioned $0.14 is from Cat Logistics. I'm just wondering if you could walk through the other puts and takes. It looked like incentive comp would have been about $0.05 tailwind if I read that correctly.","Brad Halverson","I would say that\u2019s our fault. We rounded to the nearest $100 million last time and we rounded to the nearest $10 million this time. There was by and large little change in our forecast for incentive comp. We did raise guidance this $0.25, and you would normally think that would add to incentive comp.","But most of the add was for the gain that we had on the sale of the logistics business. And our comp is based on OPACC, operating profit after capital charge and that gain was below operating profit, so it\u2019s really not having any impact on the incentive comp.","Ted Grace","Okay. Was there any incremental benefit from restructuring that you would realize in 2015 that was not previously anticipated?","Brad Halverson","I would say not that was not previously anticipated. I mean, we did expect benefits from restructuring to be better this year. So no, I wouldn\u2019t say we added anything for that. Now we did add to restructuring cost. And down the road after those are complete, those should definitely lead to more benefits. But actually in the short-term, there are related costs for things like rearrangement that aren\u2019t included in the number that contend to be a little bit negative around the time you are actually doing it.","So I would say on balance that is relative to our original outlook not a big reason for change. We took the profit outlook up, mostly because of very good cost control in the first quarter. We don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but we were a little better than we thought we were going to be in the quarter. And some of that of course was timing, but some of it is spending that we don\u2019t think we will have to make as the year goes on.","Ted Grace","Okay. And FX, was that any dynamic in the revision?","Brad Halverson","No, not much. In fact, we didn\u2019t really change our outlook for currency. We did do a spot check on the impact on profit of recent changes and that was pretty neutral. So we will take another look at that midyear and see if there is any changes need for that.","Ted Grace","Great. Thanks a lot. And best of luck this quarter, guys.","Brad Halverson","Thanks, Ted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce the affiliation and pose your question.","Jerry Revich","Good morning. It\u2019s Goldman Sachs. I am wondering if you could talk about what was just the magnitude of material cost benefit that you realized this quarter. And I know you're working hard with the supply chain, just help us understand how we should think about the puts and takes over the balance of the year for material costs with volumes coming down, but commodity costs that should be I think lower sequentially. Can you may be give us more color there?","Doug Oberhelman","Yes. Absolutely, material cost control has been a real positive actually not just in the first quarter, but over the past few years the team has done a great job. That\u2019s a combination of the purchasing group and the design group in terms of designing for cost reduction. So it\u2019s been pretty good. It was a decent positive again in the first quarter. If memory serves me, it was in the neighborhood of 1.5%.","Now to the extent that we buy things in non-U.S. currencies, we wouldn\u2019t be including it and that kind of number we isolate the impact of currency on our expenses separately at least for those that are denominated in foreign currencies.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And my follow-up on the dealer inventory side, how should we think about inventory levels over the balance of the year? And out of the inventory build that we saw in the quarter, is it in the right regions, is it in areas that you folks want?","Doug Oberhelman","Yes. I mean, we did have an inventory build in the first quarter and we didn\u2019t talk a lot about that in the release, partly because I think sometimes it gets taken out of context. We expect an inventory build in the first quarter. The selling season from dealers and customers tends to be heavier in the summertime and so dealers add inventories up ahead of summertime. That occurred this year in construction industries.","We have order of magnitude of 180 million dealers or 180 dealers roughly around the world. At any given point in time, you\u2019ve got some of them, they probably have a little too much and some that have probably a little too little. If we look at our months of supply on hand, we kind of try to judge that in a reasonable range and we do look at that by region.","And by and large, I think our dealer inventory we would say is in a reasonable range. Now from here, we definitely believe it will come down over the course of the year that happened last year. That\u2019s kind of normal to have a build in the first quarter and then have dealers sell that down as we go through the year.","Jerry Revich","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Seth Weber","Good morning. It's RBC. I wanted to ask about the Resource Industries segment. The margin there in the first quarter actually went up sequentially even though revenue was down. I mean, do you feel like the margin has bottomed in that business at this point?","Doug Oberhelman","No, I wouldn\u2019t say that, Seth. I think if you look at it sequentially, you always have to consider that we have some reasonable seasonality between the first quarter and the fourth quarter or fourth quarter to first quarter in discretionary costs. So fourth quarter was a pretty heavy quarter, first quarter was a pretty like quarter in terms of spending. So I think that has a lot to do with the sequential improvement.","Now I think Resource Industries margins will likely come down as the year progresses. We kind of said before we thought something around breakeven was probably reasonable. I think that we are going to add the spending over the course of the year. We\u2019ve got some R&D programs that we need to do there. We talked about that in January. So my guess is coming off of a pretty light quarter for cost and some increase in engineering as the year goes by and probably not a lot of change in the topline, margin will probably moderate from where it\u2019s at.","Seth Weber","So just to be clear to get to a breakeven kind of number, would you go negative in a given quarter for the year?","Doug Oberhelman","Once you get around breakeven, the numbers are so small that $10 million or $15 million one way or the other could cause that. I mean, if we\u2019re positive in the first quarter, we are thinking breakeven for the year. If it\u2019s slipped a little below that at the quarter during the year, that wouldn\u2019t be surprising.","Seth Weber","Okay. Thank you. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the aftermarket business for Resource, it was down, revenue was down. Is there any kind of light at the end of the tunnel there? Or is that -- I mean, what do you think needs to happen there for the aftermarket business to get better on mining?","Mike DeWalt","That\u2019s a very good question. We've been asking ourselves that. We've got customers with some parked equipment. We think again there's been some cannibalizing of equipment in the field. We are looking -- I think customers are pushing out rebuild times. In our view that can't keep happening but it has been happening. So when that turns around, it is like the industry overall. It\u2019s a little bit hard to predict the timing but we understand where both parked sales and equipment sales are to what\u2019s at least for equipment a reasonable replacement level. It\u2019s far below that. But when that's going to turn around it's hard to say.","Seth Weber","Fair enough. Okay. Thank you very much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eli Lustgarten. Please announce our affiliation and poise your question. ","Eli Lustgarten","Good morning everyone.","Mike DeWalt","Good morning.","Doug Oberhelman","Good morning, Eli.","Eli Lustgarten","It's a nice quarter. We are all impressed. We talked about the breakeven in our resource now. Can you talk to us about what we should expect profitability wise, which were very impressive in both construction and in E&T? Particularly, we know volume is going to drop in E&T but you did north of $0.15, almost 16% in construction and over 20% in E&T.","And while we expect to come down in order to hold the guidance where you are, these numbers have to come down quite a bit. Can you give me some idea of what we should expect and do we think does construction go below double-digit operating margin for the year but what happens as the year unfolds and the business weakens? ","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. So, I think this really goes kind of across the company. I will touch on several of the segments. But we expect -- the first quarter was kind of seasonally low on costs. So just as a matter of course discretionary cost will go up a bit from the first quarter level. We do plan to spend some more on R&D and we talked about that last January. We are looking at negative mix. We will have negative product mix in E&T because of the decline in the oil business that's coming. We also expect some negative mix in Construction Industries.","If you look at what they sold in the first quarter, it was relatively balanced between -- we have three pieces of construction -- earthmoving, excavation and building construction products, so BCP are smaller equipment. So what we actually saw in the quarter, at least in terms of new equipment was fairly balanced between those three subsectors. But if you look at what was ordered and what we think is going to happen for sales as the year unfolds, probably not a lot of change in total for construction but a bit more of a shift to BCP smaller machines.","And part of that is -- in countries like China where the selling season is very early in the year that helps excavation sales. And then that tails down later in the year. So, we are looking at some negative mix in construction as the year goes on. I don\u2019t think for the year we are not, at least in our -- contemplated in our outlook, we are not going to fall below double digits for construction. E&T operating profit percent will, I think for sure come down I guess I can\u2019t say for sure. We would expect it would come down and mostly because of declines in the oil business, which is -- tends to be bigger, little bit higher-margin product.","Eli Lustgarten","And can you follow-up, can we talk a little bit about what's going on in pricing across the businesses? I mean, you did single out that one of the problems in the resource business was basically pricing more than anything else. So what's going on in the other two sectors pricing wise? Are things relatively holding or is there some more price competition showing up?","Mike DeWalt","That's a good question and it's interesting. When the numbers get this small, it\u2019s too much about numbers that are relatively small. I mean, we had for the company overall $105 million of price realization that\u2019s less than 1%. I think the segment that is doing -- the segments that are doing better right now are construction and energy and transportation. Construction in particular did a little bit better, but part of that is really from a few three things. One is we had last year, this big Brazilian order from the government. And while that was good volume it was pretty low price. So without that sort of our average price level is up a bit.","We had some favorable geographic mix and we did take list price increases, a small but up at the beginning of the year, so that all contributed a bit. I think with Resource Industries, it's been down year-over-year for the last -- certain last couple of quarters. I can\u2019t remember the third but probably the third last year as well. It\u2019s just the top business right now. It is dog eat dog. And although a lot of that product that we sell is dollar-based, the sales are conducted in dollars a lot in mining. Some of our key competition like Komatsu probably has more of a yen cost based than we do and they are being aggressive. So it's a tough industry.","Doug Oberhelman","I will add. Doug Oberhelman here. Mike said dog eat dog, I\u2019d rather say a cat eats dog. But be that as it may. We are seeing a very competitive marketplace right now. We did post up a little price realization in the first quarter, which I was very happy to see. But I will tell you with a yen that's off over 50% in three years, euro, Brazilian currency, pound currency off 20 to 30% in the last year. All of our competitors aren\u2019t in the U.S. So it really is a competitive environment out there. But we are not giving up our PINS goals, our market share goals. We are doing as well as we can be expected in a tough market that we are.","Certainly, our cost management in the last couple of years has helped that, our lean manufacturing where we generated cost advantage is helping. We are still very much focused on market share. But I would say the competition for every deal has gotten greater as we've seen this dollar strengthen.","Eli Lustgarten","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce our affiliation and poise your question.","Ann Duignan","Hi, J.P. Morgan. My first question, it's really I suppose it's to you Doug. We talk about Europe and the euro being weak and what that's doing to help the European manufacturers export but are you seeing any signs of European economies getting any better at all? Or is that something that you think might be on the op income going into \u201916?","Doug Oberhelman","I think it's in our future. I said on the show this morning that it seems to me that with the QE coming in by the ECB with a euro that\u2019s up, like I said 25% or so on a year\u2019s time with energy prices where they are, the stimulus of all three of those and not to mention, continuing lowered rates, which has finally happened across Europe. I like in the euro zone, an awful lot to the period of say, 2010 \u201811 and \u201812 in the U.S. where there was a lot of stimulus.","We didn't see much growth but we see better growth now. So I am convinced it\u2019s coming. I don't know if it will be, when it will be and I\u2019m not going to predict that. But we still see and I was just with several of our European dealers, we still have the North-South divide. I think the Germans would say they see some green shoots in that economy. We\u2019re not seeing it in our numbers but they were a bit more optimistic in Germany, of course a euro at $1.07, $1.08 really benefits those exporters.","So I think, we\u2019re on the early stages of what will be a recovery. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a boom and I think it\u2019s going to be an anemic growth probably looking a lot like what we've seen here. But it will feel better when it happens for sure, Ann.","Ann Duignan","I'm sure it will. And then just switching gears as my follow-up, we track the U.S. construction industry shipments from census data and those have been done but orders are down about 27% in Q1. That's just through February. Can you talk about what you're seeing out there on construction industry orders? Does that include exports that might have weakened because of the strength of the dollar or what's going on out there in terms of industry orders on the construction equipment side? Thanks.","Doug Oberhelman","Yeah. I haven\u2019t looked at it by region so much. But I know that for our construction industry segment, if I look at orders in the first quarter, all I\u2019ll tell you is they\u2019re down -- they\u2019re down, I mean, no doubt about that but our backlog was a little bit lower in the first quarter. But our orders were certainly not down anywhere near that over the magnitude.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And just that have anything to do with the fact that your dealers cannot cancel orders so we might be seeing some delivery. We may have inventories corrected later in the year or have you changed that policy? And then I leave it there.","Mike DeWalt","We actually work very closely with dealers to help them set, sort of, in combination what an appropriate level of inventory for them is. I mean the last thing we want is the dealer ending up with too much. I mean that it never helps anybody if that's the case. So I don't think there's any -- there's no -- as far as I know, I can't see any inventory problem sitting out there. If you\u2019re going back and looking two years ago, that was the case but that\u2019s just not the case now. I\u2019m probably not looking at the same data that you\u2019re looking at on the 27%. All I can tell you is our orders aren\u2019t down. And are you talking versus a year ago, Ann?","Ann Duignan","Yes. It's the U.S. consensus data or census data -- excuse me -- and it is year over year through February.","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. I couldn\u2019t. Any comment on how we are relative to that number be pure speculation on my part but we\u2019re not seeing that kind of a decline, no.","Ann Duignan","Okay. That's helpful color. Okay. I'll get back in line. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Fisher. Please announce your affiliation then post your question.","Steven Fisher","Great. Thanks. It's UBS. Just a follow-up on that last question there, how did the 9% increase in North American construction sales compare to your expectations? I know you are earlier in the year looking for North America to be up for the year. Is that still the case and should we maybe now be prepared for some year-over-year declines in North American contraction as the year plays on?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. I think on balance and our outlook in January and I kind of updated that a little bit today. We expected construction sales to be down 5% to 10%. But then and now, the only region that\u2019s likely to be in neutral to positive territory is North America. The first quarter was by and large about what we expected.","Steven Fisher","Okay. So North American construction still expected to be up for the year, is the context of that down 5% to 10%?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. I would say the total was down 5% to 10%. The only region that\u2019s not really down is North America but the numbers are very small. I would say it\u2019s within the margin of error to be neutral to positive.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then can you just give us a sense of the pace of the bookings on the Solar Turbines in the quarter and maybe how far out that backlog extends now for the business? Are you putting anything in there for 2016 yet? Thanks.","Doug Oberhelman","I\u2019ll take that, Mike. And I just came back from Solar in San Diego two days ago and got a pretty good briefing. I would say their forecast, which is rolled up into ours for \u201815 is a pretty good line of sight to that. They would not speculate it and really don't know much beyond that into \u201816 as yet. I would say around gas compression, of course, which is the big piece of solar business that has held up. And there's a lot of pipeline work going on. There is a lot of pressure behind it that\u2019s required and that's our turbine and compressor in most cases.","So I\u2019d say it\u2019s again a challenging environment but for gas compression the rest of the year, they\u2019re pretty much, I think going to end up where we thought they would be and that\u2019s good. And we\u2019re not going to do anything about \u201816 and even speculate today. And we will later in the year because things are evolving so quickly here that I don\u2019t know what it will be and we\u2019re concentrating on \u201815. But solar I think it\u2019s got a year that we\u2019re pretty confident about that\u2019s baked into here as well.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation and post your question.","Andrew Casey","Wells Fargo Securities. Thanks a lot. A bigger question, a bigger picture question within North America, have you seen any sort of equipment flow back from the energy production areas to date or do you think that's a potential more in the second half?","Mike DeWalt","No. I think we\u2019ve seen weaker -- I\u2019m going to use the U.S. region as the example here. We\u2019ve seen certainly a decline in orders in business there. We\u2019ve actually even seen some decline in part sales in those regions. So, anecdotally I would tell you, I think we are seeing impact of lower oil prices in our construction business today.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And then if I could follow-up on the pricing question specific to construction, you gave a litany of things. Is it your sense that full-year pricing may be more like flat coming off the strong Q1 performance because you have more difficult comps related to Brazil construction, the shift to BCP and then what you describe the competitive marketplace?","Mike DeWalt","Yes. When we did our year-end release, we said that we expected price realization to be favourable, but less than about 0.5%. And by and large, I think that is still the case. I mean, the first quarter was in positive territory. I think we expect to end the year in positive territory, but I mean pretty small numbers. By and large, if you think around 0.5% plus or minus, you're probably in the ballpark.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz.","It\u2019s Barclays. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Doug Oberhelman","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mike, can you talk a little bit more about your backlog movements within the quarter? You noted an improvement in locomotive backlog and in your segment commentary you talked about a large locomotive project in Asia. So can you talk about what drove your locomotive backlog? Is that sort of the ending of the North American locomotives or is that more international related growth?","Mike DeWalt","Okay. So the Asia comment in the -- around the quarter was locomotive shipments can be kind of lumpy. We had a decent size order for multiple locomotives go out to a customer in Australia in the quarter. So that was the kind of genesis of the Asia comment in the quarter.","In terms of the backlog, we during the quarter took an order from one of the North American railroads for new locomotives and what the railroads do is they will place an order. And it's usually for multiple years and you'll produce portions of it kind of over the course of the contract. And we had an order placed in the first quarter from North American railroad.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it .But it\u2019s a long-term contract when it comes down to it?","Mike DeWalt","Sure. Yes, absolutely.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. So just shifting gears you increased restructuring cost at $250 million, up from $150 million with the increase primarily related to facilities that produce mining products. Can you talk about your decision process when it comes to restructuring Resource Industries? You disclosed in your 10-K that you have got 36 mining related facilities at the end of 2014. So how do you gauge when to take action regarding these facilities? And can you talk about the payback period and benefits you expect in your recent actions?","Brad Halverson","Yes.","Doug Oberhelman","It\u2019s Doug here. Brad just before you do that, I\u2019d like to come back to that locomotive order that Mike mentioned one of the big six in North America that was a tier 4 order for our new emissions locomotive, which will be available in 2016.","And there has been a lot of discussion around our tier 4 readiness and that was a big order for us and we\u2019ll start shipping at '16 our long-term contract. It starts pretty quickly as soon as we give that technology ready which as I said it will be next year. Sorry Brad.","Brad Halverson","No, no, it\u2019s good. Hi, Andy, it\u2019s Brad.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hi, Brad.","Brad Halverson","Let me talk a little bit about this. There has been a lot of discussion about it. And we\u2019ve been fairly active in terms of the studies that we do here. We\u2019ll go through a process where we\u2019ll -- we are cyclical, we\u2019ve seen this before. On the one side we want to be ready for the upturn. Our business model is to produce quality products, lowest on operating costs, produces parts and service from us and the dealers and repeat business.","And so on that side given the fact that our sales can move fairly dramatically through the cycles, we want to be ready to be able to meet that demand. But on the other side, it\u2019s absolutely clear and a good question that this current economic environment presents a lot of opportunities. So we've been at this since 2013.","In fact, if you can add up what we've done in the last three years, including what we plan to do in '15, we will incur roughly $900 million of restructuring cost. We\u2019ve closed or downsized roughly 20 facilities, about 5 million of square feet during that period again through '15 and about 15,000 employees which is unfortunate.","All-in then, if you look at the benefits we mentioned to you before that we believe after '15 the benefits per year would be $400 million to $500 million per year with what we've done which we\u2019ve had higher benefits on than we anticipated and what we have in place will be at the high end or exceed that in terms of our benefits per year.","And so it's a robust process, it\u2019s done by our product source playing group with involvement across all the facilities all the regions. There has been some discussion about big facilities. It\u2019s very hard to close the single source Decatur facility in terms of the mining trucks, it would be the same for each periods. So those things just don't dollar out in terms of return to shareholders and we do a net present value calculation through that.","So I would say that we're continuing to look, we\u2019ve added a few more in the mining space. If you go back to 2012, we were $66 billion in sales. We are $50 billion now. We\u2019ve lost roughly $16 billion, 75% of that is mining and we\u2019ve held at 25% decremental pull-through right in that range. And so there\u2019s a lot of things going on that support that, including lean and material cost.","But I would say that we are pretty happy with that pull-through over that three-year period. We've done that with little price and higher quality and growing market share. So we are not saying we won\u2019t have more to do, but that process is ongoing and we\u2019ve been pretty active in it.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. Thanks, Brad.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Raso. Please pronounce your affiliation, then pose your question.","David Raso","Evercore ISI. Good morning. I\u2019ll keep it pretty simple. I am just trying to figure out the cadence of earnings for the year. The first quarter was $1.86 ex the restructuring and almost never is the second quarter not as high or higher than the first quarter or maybe once in the last 20 years and that was a quarter when you are just starting to buy Bucyrus.","So even if I pull out the gain on the first quarter, call it $1.72, if the second quarter has also been $1.72 or higher to do your full year, the back half of year has to be doing $0.70, $0.75 per quarter. Is there conservatism in the guidance or does it drop-off that sharply?","Brad Halverson","No, what I would tell you is if you look at our internal forecast of the three quarters, they are not -- I mean, they are very close to each other. So we see it beginning in the second quarter -- the second quarter we would expect to be lower than the first quarter on sales.","And to your point that, that almost -- that doesn't happen very often. But our forecast for this year is second quarter actually lower than the first quarter on both sales and profit not much different through the rest of the year. I mean, there are small pluses and minuses. But by and large, you can look at our full year, take out our first quarter and think about the remainder as close to what we are thinking.","David Raso","All right. I mean, I am just trying to figure if sourcing in the second quarter is dropping to call it $1.20 or something like that and the last two quarters are $1. The dropoff from energy and some locomotives, what\u2019s the offset in the second half of the year to make up for some of that? You still have the earnings dropping off, I am just trying to understand -- they drop off pretty sharply, so what are some of the things we are expecting to be better?","Brad Halverson","Yes. So a couple of things. So you are correct in the idea that particularly for reciprocating engines, we will have fairly sizable declines in the second half of the year, actually beginning in the -- probably beginning sometime in the second quarter and continuing on through the year. But there are other parts of the business like solar where the timing of the year is, usually the second half is higher than the first half and we certainly see that happening this year.","We have -- I think Marine sales up a bit higher in the back half of the year then the front half of the year and much of the rest of the business is actually reasonably -- in fact, I just look at this morning, kind of almost anticipating this question.","The rest of the year for most of the rest of the businesses are by and large relatively stable as we go through the year. So the drop-off will be more oil, but it will be mitigated a little bit by timing in some of the segments and a little bit of an increase in marine.","David Raso","And then it's not related to that, the inventory you mentioned a bit of a tickdown through the rest of the year. Can you help quantify at company level as well as dealer level?","Doug Oberhelman","Yeah. If I look at company level, I\u2019m going to be a little bit more vague because we have continuing benefits from our lean manufacturing journey above and beyond where we were last year baked in. We\u2019ve got, I will say aggressive goals in our forecast.","So, I would say, without giving a number, we\u2019re looking for, kind of a cadence of improvement as result of that or decline in inventory as we go through the year. Not massive -- I mean, certainly not like we had in the fourth quarter of last year but our forecast would reflect modest declines in each of the next few quarters.","David Raso","So the dealer inventory for the year I think -- ","Doug Oberhelman","The dealer inventory for the year?","David Raso","About a $1 billion?","Doug Oberhelman","Yeah. Sure. Yeah. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve given a number but we added the inventory in the first quarter. Our forecast would reflect all of that coming out, plus a little bit more.","David Raso","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","Doug Oberhelman","It\u2019s a case where our sales for the year are coming down from 55 to 50 and not all of that is oil. Some of that maybe oil related but it\u2019s still in construction. So, I think that we will probably end the year a bit less than we were last year. Mining inventory is going to continue to come down little bit this year, not as much as last year. But it\u2019s going to continue edging its way down like it did in the first quarter.","David Raso","All right. I appreciate the detail. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Wertheimer with Vertical Research. Please announce affiliation and poise your question.","Robert Wertheimer","It\u2019s Vertical Research. Good morning, everybody.","Doug Oberhelman","Good morning.","Robert Wertheimer","So, I guess the question is on capital allocation. The commentary on share repurchase in the press release was balanced I guess with that and other opportunities. I'm just curious if just given the maybe bounding opportunities in oil and gas, I'm not sure, whether it makes, whether we should expect you to cut back on share buybacks for a couple of quarters just in case something develops? Or how you think about staging that, if you'd buy something and then reassure shares, how are you thinking about that?","Doug Oberhelman","I\u2019ll take that one. Doug Oberhelman here. We really haven\u2019t changed our priorities of cash at all. If anything, the top priority to maintain the balance sheet is I think becoming more important to us as the uncertainty around us continues on, if not increases. We reported that we are about I guess 37% or so on debt to debt and equity. That\u2019s being coming, trending down and we will trend that down throughout the year.","We bought $400 million of shares in the first quarter, which I think is a reasonable planning rate for the rest of the year, assuming our plan holds up. We will end the -- I have no doubt we\u2019ll end the year with cash, a lot of cash, as we did in the first quarter over $7 billion. I think in this area of uncertainty, where day-to-day one never knows what going to happen and having recently been burned on that in 2008 with a big downturn and a weak balance sheet that\u2019s where we are going to be.","The other thing and I've said this before is that we are continually looking for growth opportunities. And that strong balance sheet allows us lots of flexibility for growth, for protection, maintain our dividend and modestly increase it. As we\u2019ve said before buying shares back. But I would say that we\u2019re in the driver seat with cash generation, with our inventory turnover arising, our lean manufacturing freeing up cash.","And as these other priorities work through, share buyback will likely over time continue to be important thing for us. But in 2015, we\u2019re just planning right now on that $4 million until we kind of per quarter or so given the uncertainties and the challenges we see everyday in the marketplace.","Robert Wertheimer","That's wonderful. Thank you, Doug. If I can ask my follow-up, Mike, I think mentioned that oil and gas in the drilling and completions and Doug, I believe you mentioned that solar looks okay. Is there any risk or is it long enough into this downturn to see if there's a risk to parts, all our mining not just in sort of fracing, completion drilling but just production pipeline and anything else? Do you anticipate right now that this is isolated to drilling and completion or could it spillover either on pricing or volume on the rest of it? Thank you.","Mike DeWalt","You never say never about anything. But generally speaking, if you are going to produce and you\u2019re going to move things through oil -- oil through a pipeline or you need the equipment to work to do that. If there is hesitation, if there is customer maybe like mining they have the possibility that could push out things like overhauls and rebuilds that potentially could be a negative.","I would say, we\u2019re not really seeing a lot of that right now outside of kind of the drilling and fracing were activity is off. Remember though and I think these needs to be said, a lot of our business in oil and gas, probably most of our business in oil and gas is gas. And so far that's held up pretty well. Demand for gas is good and the compression business is doing pretty well. So oil is just a one piece of our oil and gas business.","Robert Wertheimer","Thank you, Mike.","Doug Oberhelman","Well. With that, I think we\u2019re going to wrap it up. We are at the top of the hour. Thank you for joining us and we\u2019ll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Ma'am, the floor is yours.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thank you, Kate. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to our Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Amy Campbell, Caterpillar's Director of Investor Relations. And on the call today, I'm pleased to have our CEO, Jim Umpleby; our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson; and our Vice President of Financial Services, Joe Creed.","Remember, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited.

A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results to differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements filed with the SEC and is also in our forward-looking statement language included in today's financial release and in today's presentation.","In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can also be found in this morning's release and is posted at caterpillar.com\/earnings. We're going to start the call this morning with a few words from Jim, and then Brad will walk us through third quarter results and our revised outlook, and then we will begin the Q&A portion of the call. Jim?","Donald James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thank you, Amy. I'd like to start by thanking and congratulating our team for excellent results this quarter. Sales and revenues were up 25% from the third quarter of 2016, and adjusted profit per share is well over double what it was one year ago.","Overall, we're seeing broad-based sales increases across a number of industries in all regions. We continue to see strength in China construction. Onshore oil and gas in North America is also strong. Construction activity in North America was up compared to last year, and we're seeing increased order activity by mining customers. Our profit margins continued to improve in our three primary segments. The improved margins are driven by higher sales volume, price realization primarily in Construction Industries, and our team's focus on cost discipline. Material costs were a slight headwind in the third quarter, and we expect this trend to continue.","With this more widespread increase in sales, we have raised our full-year top line outlook. We now expect full-year 2017 sales and revenues of about $44 billion. And as a result of our team's strong performance, we are raising our 2017 adjusted profit per share outlook to about $6.25. We know product availability is a concern in some areas. We continue to work with our supply chain to increase production levels to satisfy customer demand for those markets that are improving.","I'm also pleased with our progress in executing our new strategy for profitable growth based on operational excellence, expanded offerings and services. We presented the strategy in September, but I'm going to take a minute to recap the main components for you again today. We are pursuing profitable growth by reinvesting in our strengths. We are running our business using our operating and execution model as we have been for some time in select areas of the company. Now, we're expanding it across the enterprise and strengthening its governance. We're expanding services with an emphasis on the aftermarket and are investing in our digital capabilities. We're also extending our product offerings.","We're fully committed to our lean manufacturing journey and to excelling at the fundamentals of safety, quality and cost control. We want to ensure our customers are more successful using our products than they are using our competitors. Finally and above all else, we'll be guided by our values in action.","We'll measure the success of this new strategy by the value we bring to our customers, the profits we generate to fund reinvestment and the returns we generate for our shareholders. I'm confident in our team's ability to execute the strategy and confident Caterpillar is well positioned to compete and grow profitably.","With that, I'll turn it over to Brad.","Bradley M. Halverson - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, thanks, Jim. Good morning to everybody. As Jim stated, it was a strong quarter with higher sales across all regions and improved margins, and we raised the profit outlook. Our commitment to running the business using the operating and execution model is evident in the team's focus on profitable growth and cost discipline building on our restructuring efforts.","Let's turn to slide 4, and I'll quickly walk through the numbers. Sales and revenues of $11.4 billion were up 25% from the third quarter of last year, our strongest quarter-over-quarter in terms of sales and revenue growth since the fourth quarter of 2011. About half of the increase in sales volume was from higher end-user demand. The other half was from favorable changes to dealer inventory.","The favorable change to dealer inventory was mostly due to the absence of dealer inventory reductions that occurred last year during a full-year run of dealers reducing inventory by over $6 billion, not from dealers building significant inventory this year. Dealers reduced inventory $700 million in the third quarter of last year as compared to a $200 million dealer inventory increase in the third quarter this year, a net change of $900 million.","While changes to dealer inventory were favorable, it is important to note that dealer inventory in terms of months of sales are low based on historical levels and are lower than at the end of the second quarter. Profit per share was up $1.29 from $0.48 to $1.77. Adjusted profit per share more than doubled, up $1.10 from $0.85 in the third quarter 2016 to $1.95. Higher sales volume and favorable price realization were the largest drivers to the increase in profit.","Let's turn to slide 5. Third quarter operating profit was $1.577 billion as compared with $481 million in 2016, up almost $1.1 billion. Positive changes to operating profit came from several areas. The largest increase to profit was a result of higher sales volume. About half of the change was from higher end-user demand and half was from a favorable change to dealer inventories.","All four geographic regions saw sales and revenue increases ranging from 20% to 29% versus a year ago. However, keep in mind that, in some cases, this was off a very low base, especially in Latin America. Dollar sales increase was highest in North America primarily due to higher end-user demand for both new equipment and aftermarket parts as well as favorable changes to dealer inventories as dealers in North America held inventory about flat in the quarter versus reducing inventories in the third quarter a year ago.","Asia\/Pacific saw the second highest increase in dollar sales primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment. About half of the increase was in China with strength also broadening to other countries in the region.","Price improved $343 million in the quarter. The favorable change was primarily due to Construction Industries. Variable manufacturing costs were favorable $143 million largely due to the favorable impact of period costs absorbed, as inventories increased in many of our factories to support higher production levels.","As we ramp up production, we remain focused on lean principles, and the inventory turns improved in all three primary segments. As we ramp, we are working closely with our supply base to reduce lead times and raise production levels, in some cases, off of a very low base. Our focus is getting product to customers quickly, but also efficiently. However, we are focused on improving availability to meet higher end-user demand.","For the first time in several years, material cost increased in the quarter. We expect higher steel costs to put pressure on material costs moving forward. Total period costs were higher by $349 million. When you exclude the higher short-term incentive accrual, period costs were about flat despite a significant increase in sales volume. This is a reflection of our continued cost discipline that has enabled us to control costs while making targeted investments in key areas to drive future profitable growth.","Restructuring actions continue. These actions are important to achieving the flexible cost structure required to remain profitable through the cycles. Restructuring costs were $90 million in the quarter, $234 million less than in the third quarter of 2016.","Before we walk through the segments, I want to touch on the balance sheet. ME&T debt-to-capital at the end of the second (sic) [third] (10:28) quarter was 36.1%, an improvement from 38.6% at the end of the second quarter. Year-to-date, ME&T operating cash flow was $4.2 billion, $2.4 billion higher than the first nine months of last year. Enterprise cash at the end of the quarter was $9.6 billion.","Now let's move on and we'll go through the segments, starting on slide 6. And we'll start with Construction Industries. Construction Industries sales were up 37% to $4.9 billion. Higher sales in all regions and favorable price realization contributed to the increase. Order activity was strong in the quarter across all regions, and the backlog increased about $500 million. About half of the sales volume increase was from favorable changes to dealer inventories. Most of this favorable dealer inventory change occurred in North America and EAME, where there was significant reductions to dealer inventory in the third quarter of last year. Asia\/Pacific and EAME dealers increased inventory in the quarter.","Construction Industries dealer inventory is up about $300 million from the start of the year, but from a month of sales metric, they're low versus historical levels. The other half of the sales volume increase was a result of higher end-user demand. North America end-user demand increased primarily due to increasing activity in the oil and gas industry, including an uptick in pipeline construction and improving residential and nonresidential construction.","Asia\/Pacific saw strength across the region. However, China continues to be a bright spot and a surprise to the upside. Our current estimate for 2017 is for the 10-ton-and-above excavator industry in China to more than double versus last year, which would result in sales that are higher than our estimate of normal replacement demand for the region.","We believe that some demand has been pulled forward into 2017 so that construction projects can be completed before activity slows in the winter months. While we are seeing strengthening fundamentals in parts of EAME, the favorable sales increase was primarily due to favorable dealer inventory changes, not end-user demand. Price realization also contributed to the increase. Latin America, especially Brazil, remains challenged, and sales are still at very low level. However, end-user demand did increase due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region.","Construction Industries segment profit of $884 million was favorable $558 million, driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. The increase in period costs was due to higher short-term incentive compensation. Excluding the short-term incentive compensation, period costs were about flat. Segment profit margin in the quarter was 18.1%, an increase of about 900 basis points from the third quarter of last year and about flat with the second quarter of this year.","Let's move to Resource Industries on slide 7. Favorable changes to dealer inventories combined with strong demand for aftermarket parts to support overhauls and maintenance work, as well as improved price realization were the primary drivers of the $500 million increase in sales and revenues for Resource Industries, an increase of 36%. Dealer deliveries of new equipment increased slightly.","As we have stated previously, the mining cycle has started to turn. The parked fleet has come down from its peak and stabilized for several months. The initial surge earlier this year in trucks coming into service bays for overhauls has started to subside, especially in Australia, where we first saw demand increase, but demand for aftermarket parts remains at a healthy level.","Utilization on trucks has steadily trended higher over the past eight months and recently achieved a five-year high. While the number of trucks being overhauled has come down, the higher utilization and number of trucks working in the mines has also contributed to an increase in aftermarket parts demand.","For the third quarter in a row and after four years of dealers reducing their inventories and our factories producing below retail demand, dealer inventories were about flat in the quarter, driving a favorable change to sales. Year-to-date, Resource Industries dealer inventory is up just slightly from the end of 2016.","Although price realization was favorable in the quarter, the competitive environment in Resource Industries continues to put pressure on pricing for many of our products. Order activity across all regions remained strong in the quarter, and the backlog increased about $300 million from the second quarter. However, Resource Industries new equipment sales and production levels still remain at historically low levels.","Segment profit was $226 million, up $303 million from a loss of $77 million in 2016. The improvement in profit resulted from higher sales volume, favorable price realization, lower manufacturing cost, primarily due to cost absorption as inventories increased in the quarter and were about flat a year ago. Period costs were about flat as the benefits from a number of restructuring and cost reduction actions offset higher short-term incentive compensation. Segment profit as a percent of sales improved to 11.6% from a loss position a year ago. It was the best quarter this year for Resource Industries in terms of both segment profit and profit as a percent of sales.","Now we'll move to Energy & Transportation on slide 8. Energy & Transportation sales, including inter-segment sales, were up about $600 million or 16% in the quarter to $4.8 billion. Sales were higher across all applications. New engines and aftermarket sales for industrial applications increased in all regions to support higher equipment demand across several industrial customers' end markets.","In oil and gas, demand for aftermarket parts to support well servicing applications increased in the quarter. In addition, the build-out of North American natural gas infrastructure, combined with new wells that have had a higher concentration of natural gas than previous wells, continued to drive strong demand in midstream gas compression.","Sales into power generation were up, largely due to timing of projects in North America and EAME. Transportation sales were also up, as rail services demand increased to support higher North America rail traffic in the quarter. Segment profit for Energy &Transportation was up $178 million from $572 million to $750 million. This was largely attributable to higher sales volume and a favorable impact from cost absorption, as inventories increased in the third quarter of this year to support higher production levels and were flat last year. Period cost increased in the quarter, primarily driven by higher short-term incentive compensation. Segment profit as a percent of sales improved 180 basis points to 15.5% from 13.7%.","Before I move on to the outlook, a few comments on Financial Products. Operating profit was about flat versus the third quarter of last year. The portfolio remains healthy with past dues down 4 basis points from the third quarter of 2016 and used equipment prices continued to improve.","Now let's move on to the outlook on slide 9. In July, we provided an outlook for sales and revenues of $42 billion to $44 billion. As a result of encouraging order rates, good economic indicators and an increasing backlog, we are providing new guidance for sales and revenues of about $44 billion. We have raised the profit per share outlook to about $4.60 and raised the adjusted profit per share outlook from $5 at the midpoint of the previous sales and revenue range to about $6.25. The increase in the profit outlook is largely a result of a higher estimate for sales combined with a favorable mix, improved price realization, and the slower ramp of period cost spend for targeted investments. These positives are slightly offset by an increase in short-term incentive compensation expense and higher material cost.","Sales and revenues in 2016 were $38.5 billion, and profit per share was a loss of $0.11 with adjusted profit per share of $3.42. Our revised outlook is sales and revenues of about $44 billion, profit per share of $4.60, and adjusted profit per share of $6.25. This equates to adjusted profit per share up more than 80% on about a 14% sales and revenues increase. The implied fourth quarter is for sales and revenues of about $11.4 billion and adjusted profit per share of $1.53. We expect higher material cost and period cost spend for targeted investments will negatively impact operating leverage in the fourth quarter.","Now let's discuss the sales outlook starting on slide 10. We now expect Construction Industries' sales for the year to be up about 20% versus the previous outlook of up 10% to 15%, driven largely by higher end-user demand across all regions. The increase on the sales outlook is driven primarily by a higher sales forecast for Asia\/Pacific and North America, with strength in Asia\/Pacific expanding beyond just China. Order rate for Construction Industries have been strong across all regions, although in many cases off a very low base. The backlog is up significantly from the third quarter of 2016 and also up from the second quarter of 2017.","For Resource Industries, we now expect sales to be up about 30% for the full year versus the previous outlook of up 20% to 25%. In our prior outlook, we expected aftermarket parts sales to decline in the second half of the year, as machine rebuilds were expected to slow and for sale of new equipment to offset this decrease.","As predicted, we did see some slowing in aftermarket parts sales in the third quarter; however, not to the pace that was anticipated. The increase to the sales outlook for Resource Industries is largely driven by our higher expectation for aftermarket parts sales. Our forecast for new equipment sales has not changed from our previous outlook. We continue to see strong order activity for Resource Industries, and the backlog increased from both the third quarter 2016 and the second quarter of this year.","Energy & Transportation sales are forecasted to be up about 10% for the year versus the previous outlook of up 5% to 10%. The largest driver of the increase in the sales outlook for Energy & Transportation is a higher forecast for the sale of engines into industrial applications, as our customers across several industrial end markets are seeing strength in their industries.","Energy & Transportation 2017 sales growth is largely due to the strength in onshore North America oil and gas. We continue to see strong rebuild activity in wells servicing for engines, transmissions, pumps and flow iron as well as demand for new equipment. We also expect shipments to North America gas compression customers to be higher this year, driven largely by demand for reciprocating engines, as solar sales into oil and gas applications are expected to be flat for the full year.","Transportation is now expected to be up, as higher rail traffic has driven higher demand for rail services. Power generation industry remains challenged, and we anticipate sales to be about flat to slightly up for the full year.","While order activity has been strong for the first three quarters of 2017 and the backlog is up, geopolitical uncertainty, global and regional GDP growth and commodity volatility will be risks as we move into 2018. Potential tax reform and an infrastructure bill would be positives for the long term. At this time, we are focused on operational excellence, and our segments are in the process of planning and implementing strategies to drive profitable growth. It is too early to comment on 2018, and we will share more on 2018 in January.","So, let's wrap up with a few takeaways on slide 11. In the third quarter, we saw encouraging order rates and an increasing backlog in the quarter. Year-over-year sales and revenues were higher by more than $2 billion. Operational performance for the year has been strong, as third quarter segment margins continued to improve as a result of our commitment to the O&E model, operational excellence and profitable growth.","The balance sheet remains strong with $9.6 billion of enterprise cash on hand and a debt-to-cap ratio of 36.1%. Given year-to-date performance and confidence in our end markets, we raised the 2017 profit outlook. We are focused on delivering the new strategy that Jim rolled out in September at Investor Day and are focused on driving profitable growth through margin expansion, asset efficiency and expanded offerings, especially services.","With that, I'll now turn it back to you, Amy.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Brad. And, Kate, let's open up the phones for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. Our first question today is coming from Joseph O'Dea. Joseph, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. It's Vertical Research. First question on dealer inventory. In the first half of the year, the trends were pretty similar to what you had seen in the first half of 2016. So, this quarter marks the first real change we've seen there. And I guess just to understand a little bit better about why we saw that sudden change, the support behind that. And then maybe in addition, if you could just talk a little bit to the month of inventory across the segments. You touched that there're really no warning signs, as that's still below averages, but just a little context there.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Joe. So, if you look at dealer inventory first half versus second half this year versus last year, I think what you saw in the first half of 2017 was pretty typical dealer inventory behavior with dealers building inventory in the first quarter in preparation of the spring and summer selling season and then working through that inventory in the second quarter.","However, I would say the dealers did build a little bit less inventory in the first quarter of this year than they did a year prior, and that was primarily due to what was a really strong first quarter in China, some due to just what has continued to be an extremely strong industry, and some also having to do with the timing of the Chinese New Year. So, I think the first half of the year looked like what we have seasonally seen.","If you go back into 2016 and even the few years prior to that, we have seen dealers take significant inventory out in the back half of the year, both in the third and the fourth quarters. I think if you look back last year, we also saw the backlog coming down in the third quarter or maybe even just about flat. So, I think that's pretty normal activity what we're seeing on the third quarter of this year is the backlog going up.","And so I think the strength currently in the end markets, which is for Construction Industries and Resource Industries, is pretty broad based regionally. It's what's driving dealers to not pull inventory out as much. Certainly, they are working hard to satisfy end-user demand. Turn that around and look at month of sales, so even though dealer inventory didn't come out nearly as much as it did third quarter of last year, month of sales are quite a bit lower than where we ended the third quarter of 2016.","Our normal targeted range for month of sales is about 3.5 to 4 months. We're below that. Dealers are sending many products straight through the customers and not building inventory up. So, I think it really has to do with the strength in Construction and Resource end markets that they're not pulling inventory down as much. And I would guess, I would say, their order rates are up, so they're ordering and refilling general inventory, as opposed to a year ago their order rates were starting to decline.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. And then on the pricing front, really strong pricing in both Construction and Resources. How much of that was linked to the opportunity to move prices in the middle of the year as some of this restock was underway and something that you wouldn't necessarily have been able to anticipate earlier in the year, but just to try to understand the ability to get the kind of pricing you got in the quarter?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. I think if you look at the pricing in the quarter, it's largely a story of comps versus 2016, especially for Construction Industries, but even for Resource Industries to some extent. If you look at 2016, I think prices were down about 4% or so for the full year. We've largely clawed that negative price realization back through the third quarter of 2016. And so if you look over a couple of year trend for construction industry pricing, it's really been fairly flat. I think you need to go back, since 2014 price realization in Construction Industries has been fairly flat.","So, we have a \u2013 we see over the medium term a very competitive pricing situation, but 2016, as we all know, was difficult for Construction Industries from a price realization perspective. And so it's not so much that we're really seeing a market that's conducive to taking price increases. In fact, I think we would say the opposite. The market continues to be extremely competitive. The continued strong dollar is competitive.","In Resource Industries, about half of that change was just from a comp basis, some of the others was just particular deals and where those were located around the world. So, there's not much story in Resource Industries either. We also see in the Resource Industries end markets very competitive pricing situation and don't see a lot of opportunity to be able to take price increases there as well.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Very helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next call today is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Stephen, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. It's Jefferies.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning, Steve.","Donald James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","I'm wondering if we can dig in a little bit more on this inventory thing, too. And I guess my head is spinning a little bit because it looks like you're not \u2013 as you say, the dealers aren't really building. And yet, the retail sales numbers that you've been giving us are basically double what you \u2013 or sorry, Cat's reported sales are basically double what the retail sales that you gave us yesterday are. And so clearly, there's something going on there that I'm trying to kind of square up. Any insights?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. I think, it is a complicated story, and I'll attempt to walk through it kind of in the few drivers that are driving the disconnect. And so if you look at retail sales, those are neutralized for price and currency, and they don't include, generally speaking, aftermarket parts increases. And then there is the dealer inventory change.","So, of the sales increase for the quarter, if you look at \u2013 and Brad talked about this, about a $200 million dealer inventory increase versus a $700 million dealer decrease a year ago, that's $900 million favorable to the top line, you won't see that translate through retail stats. Price realization a little over $300 million favorable in the quarter; that's also not going to translate into retail stats.","And then lastly, as we talked, it's been a good quarter and a good year for aftermarket parts for mining as well as in North American oil and gas applications. And those also aren't going to translate into retail sales. So, those are the three big differences where you're seeing on a reported sales and revenues increase being significantly higher than those that are coming through retail stats.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And then maybe the next step is, how should I think about this impacting margins, because obviously your margins are very high here? Should I think that you were basically over-absorbing last year, so your margins were artificially low and this is what normal looks like? Or are you actually over-absorbing today due to these changes in inventory and sort of the normal would be maybe a little lower than it currently is?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","By over-absorbing, are you referencing the inventory numbers, Steve?","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Yeah.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. So, I mean those inventory numbers are dealer inventory, so they don't translate back into the cost absorption we see for Caterpillar inventory. We do have favorable cost absorption due to inventory increases. I don't know that I can say if that's normal or not, and I don't have \u2013 I mean, you can calculate that, that is what drove most of the variable manufacturing cost improvement in the quarter. But with these higher production levels, I think as we would expect, we are seeing Cat inventory go up to support the higher production levels. But even with that, continuing to see inventory turns improve.","So, we definitely had some favorable cost absorption into the quarter as those inventories went up. I think, as we look into the fourth quarter, that is and in the implied a little bit of profit erosion in the fourth quarter. A piece of that comes from \u2013 especially with some large shipments of solar turbines and locomotives, we will see some inventory come down in E&T when we have some negative impact expected from that in the fourth quarter.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Jerry, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning everyone. It's Goldman Sachs. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the supply chain performance, if you can touch on supplier on-time deliveries, if you can quantify that for us. And overall, what's the level of production growth over the next 12 to 24 months? Do you folks feel comfortable the supply base can underwrite? As you pointed out in the prepared remarks, it's been volatile a couple of years for a big chunk of the supply base. I'm wondering how comfortable you are with their ability to ramp.","Donald James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning, Jerry. It's Jim. I'll take that one. As we mentioned at the end of the last quarter, we have a couple of areas in particular, a couple of products where we've had very large demand increases year-over-year. We highlighted G3600 engines for gas compression in North America, and we also talked about large mining trucks. Those are the two areas that we are work \u2013 that we're struggling with a bit and working with our suppliers to be able to meet the very large increases on a percent basis in demand.","Keep in mind, both of those products came off a very low base in 2016. So we're working with our suppliers to meet the increased demand that we've seen this year, won't really comment on next year in terms of \u2013 I don't want to quantify that for next year, but we are working with our suppliers to ensure that we satisfy what we believe will be customer demand moving forward.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then separately, on dealer inventories, you folks have \u2013 with your dealers taken out over $6 billion of inventory out of the channel. I'm wondering what's your view of normalized level of dealer inventory. So, Amy, if you go back to normalized months of supply basis, what level of increase in dealer inventory should we be thinking about off of these trough levels here?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, Jerry, as you know, it's difficult to predict dealer inventories precisely. And certainly, the dealers control their inventory decisions and where they want to put inventory at. I think there is also, as we think out over the next few quarters and the demand, the end-user demand, which is where most of our efforts are going to be focused certainly in the fourth quarter, and then we'll have to see how the first half of 2018 plays out.","So I think it's difficult and probably not appropriate to forecast where dealer inventory is going to land. As I talked about three-and-a-half to four months of sales is where we have normally worked with our dealers given our availability and supply chains to target dealer inventory. We do believe there's opportunity to bring that down some with our focus on lean and reducing lead times. But I'd say even with that, dealer inventories are probably a little bit lower than the dealers would like them to be and we'd like them to be.","So over time, and I think it all depends on where end-user demand goes and where the market goes, so those are kind of decisions and numbers that move with a lot of different moving variables, where we sit right now at the end of the third quarter, dealer inventory levels are at a lower level than we've normally targeted, but exactly how much dealer inventory there is to bring back, I think, is just difficult to estimate.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Jamie, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. Credit Suisse. I guess two questions. I mean, Jerry just asked the question on sort of the supply chain. But from talking to the dealers too, they seem to think some of the issues isn't just the supply chain, it's Cat's not willing to really ramp production. So can you just talk about sort of lead times by product line? Where the biggest bottlenecks are and just sort of do we think these issues could start to work through \u2013 could work \u2013 could be more favorable in 2018 versus where we were in 2017?","And then I guess my second question, Amy, I understand you guys don't want to talk about 2018 (40:37) in terms of at least the top line, which we can make our own assumptions there. But if you look at the back half of the year, your run rating $3.15 (40:42) earnings. So is there anything sort of unusual items that we should think about that could impact incremental margins in 2018? On the positive, I'm assuming you'd be getting savings from restructuring. Any other one-time things you could point out that could help \u2013 at least help us think about 2018 assuming we make our own top line decisions?","Donald James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Hi, Jamie. It's Jim again. Well, certainly, Cat is willing to ramp up production. There's no issue there. I think the only product that we really have an issue in terms of our ability to meet demand is G3600 engines from a manufacturing capacity perspective. All the other issues that we're dealing with have to do with supplier capacity. So there's no reluctance on our part to ramp up production to meet demand, and we do believe we have enough manufacturing capacity to meet what we see in terms of demand for the next few years.","So really, it's a matter of working with our suppliers. A lot of this is an industry problem. It's not just us. As I'm sure you've learned through your research that a number of our competitors are dealing with the same kinds of issues with the supply base. So again, we're working that hard and believe that we're seeing improvements and will continue to see improvements on that front.","In terms of visibility for next year, again we decided not to give a top line estimate for 2018 at this time. I really want to keep the team focused on executing our strategy. In terms of your question on margins, we will continue to make targeted investments to grow our business in the long term. So we've talked about some of the investments at Investor Day, whether they be in our digital capabilities, in various products. So again, we will be making targeted investments moving forward.","Amy, I don't know if you want to add to that at all.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, I think probably just a couple other \u2013 Jim had can of a high level \u2013 a couple other maybe small points to think about as you think about 2018. We do look at the competitive pricing situation. We talked about it all year. We don't think it's changed. We continue to think that pricing will be very competitive as we move into 2018. And exactly what does that translate to dollars, we're not ready to have a forecast for, but that is something we're keeping our eye on.","Material costs, we've started to see those turn negative especially due to steel prices. And while our teams continue to work on redesign and other supply chain actions to bring down material costs, we do see steel costs, the material costs as we move in 2018 to be a headwind. And then I think the big tailwind that's out there is short-term incentive compensation expense we're accruing at a rate of $1.4 billion this year. A more normal payout is probably closer to $800 million to $850 million. So there's a little bit of a nice tailwind there. But as Jim alluded to, we are going to continue to make targeted investments, work towards delivering our margins that we showed at Investor Day, but making sure that we're making the long-term investments that we need to make to grow profitably over the long term.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thank you. That's helpful. I'll get back in queue. Nice quarter.","Donald James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thank you.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks.","Bradley M. Halverson - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. David, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Hi, Evercore ISI. Just trying to level set the look at 2017 just so we know where we're going from in 2018. A clarification, when you look at total company revenue guidance, you're right that implies the fourth quarter at $11.4 billion. But then when you look at your business segment guidance, it implies the fourth quarter is more like $12.4 billion. And I'm just trying to make sure we level set what we're thinking about for the fourth quarter, there's obviously an extra billion dollars with a reasonable incremental margin and could add another $0.35, $0.40 to 2017. So can we just clarify why the gap in those two guidances?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. I think the gap, David, honestly it just really has to do with rounding. So we thought about putting ranges in there. We stuck with kind of a single number for each one of the three segments. We will likely have a little bit higher shipments in E&T just due to normal seasonality of solar shipments. But I think, generally, when you look with that exception, you look at the three segments, sales and revenues about flat third quarter to fourth quarter.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","I mean the business segment guidance does not imply that. That's all I'm making sure. I mean CI, you're right. It implies flat. But RI, you have it up almost $400 million and E&T up almost $600 million sequentially. And I'm just making sure we level set the revenues thought and then also I'm going to ask you about the margins just so we understand where we're exiting the year.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","So, David, why don't we come back to that? I'll have to look at the math. I don't know if it's the fact that it excludes the intercompany transfer, so we got intersegment sales that are excluded in those numbers.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Yeah, but your guidance is clear. It says excluding intersegment sales. So in that same vein then, for the margins for the year, again, just so we can level set everybody thinking about 2018 and all the puts and takes, how are we thinking about margins now for the year? I know there are prior comments about each segment. Can you update us on those?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. I think if you think about margins for the year and maybe to level set, I think largely speaking the third quarter will be the high watermark. CI segment margin represents a little bit higher, 18.2% in the second quarter, 18.1% in the third quarter, but third quarter clearly the high watermark. Probably better to step back and look at kind of September year-to-date segment margin percent for all three segments. I think, generally speaking, Resource Industries, Energy & Transportation, segment margins for the full year should be pretty close to what they were September year-to-date, and that implies a little bit improvement in the fourth quarter for Energy & Transportation, and that's on those higher sales, just some leverage on those higher sales which we typically see in the fourth quarter for Energy & Transportation.","And then Construction Industries, segment margin percentage is just down just slightly for the full year versus where we ended the third quarter, which then implies a softer fourth quarter than where we are year-to-date. And that's been driven by some of this price starting to come through that we've been talking about year-to-date. We did start to see price realization get less favorable towards the end of the third quarter, some material cost headwind, and we also started to see those get more unfavorable towards the end of the third quarter and then also some targeted investments the Construction Industries has. One of those, for one example, they just launched the next-gen excavator, an exciting product, that and many other things they've got in play driving some additional costs in the fourth quarter.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","And I'm sorry. Just to clarify, on Resource Industries, it was the year-to-date is where we think the full year shall be or...","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Correct.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Okay. I mean, that does imply 8.7% in the fourth quarter just by revenues up sequentially. Should we expect RI margins to fall sequentially that much on up rev? Is there a mix issue or...?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, they also have some material cost issues, and they've got a fair number of \u2013 their R&D expenses are also increasing in the fourth quarter for some pilot products they're sending out there. So they have some higher costs in the fourth quarter as well for some of their targeted investments.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Ann, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. JPMorgan. My question is around \u2013 Jim, maybe it's a question for you, kind of more philosophical question. I mean if we look at the increase in your forecast by segment year-to-date, it reminds me of what we used to always say about Caterpillar is that it is not great at forecasting. Can you talk a little bit philosophically about how you do forecast demand? And should investors be concerned at all that, given that a lot of volume increases simply dealer inventories, is there anything different about the relationship with your dealers or the way you communicate with your dealers that investors should be concerned about going forward?","Donald James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, Ann, I don't think there's anything that investors should be concerned about. Obviously, our forecast is based upon a number of factors. It's certainly what we hear from our dealers. It's also what we monitor the industries. We have direct contact with customers. So we take into account a number of factors when we forecast demand.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then follow-up question is around \u2013 you mentioned pull forward of demand in China. Is there any pull forward of demand from your Canadian customers or dealers ahead of Tier 4 final in that region?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. And I think if you look at \u2013 maybe I'll step back to your last question, if you look at 2017, Ann, and we can talk about China pull forward, we started the year thinking that the China industry, us and I think along with everyone would be up, but up, and I don't remember the number, 20%, 25%, I think something like that. We now think it will be more than double. So, that's been a huge driver of the strength this year as well as some other things.","Canadian Tier 4, Ann, it's really difficult to know what the buying decisions of our customers are. We have Tier 3 and Tier 4 product ready to go. We have seen strong demand all year in Canada for construction equipment, and so I don't think there's anything of particular note there.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll get back in line just in the interest of time. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Gilardi. Ross, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Good morning, guys.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, I just had a question on \u2013 first one on mining. You noted spare parts coming off a little bit into the second half. But obviously, it held up better than you originally thought. But can you talk a little more about what you're seeing on new equipment from mining customers? I mean is the demand recovery coming \u2013 becoming more pervasive? I think this year you've seen it in places like Russia and India for some smaller mining trucks, but I'm wondering now are you seeing demand for bigger new equipment in places like Western Australia and Chile. And what are you seeing on the new cyber (52:21) side of the business?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. I don't have it really split out by product, Ross. I think your point is a good one. When it looks at actual shipments for Resource Industries, they really only started to be up slightly in the third quarter. That said, we have seen good order activity, I'd really say, across the board for most of our products in Resource Industries. And that strength has also broadly been around the globe. So whether it's been Australia, I think South Africa was the last to go into the downturn. They were the last to come out, but we started to see some strength there as well. I mean I think I only picked those two out. I think it really has been a fairly broad improvement for Resource Industries without anything particular to note of one area doing better than another.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks, Amy. And then I'm just curious about the large engines for oil and gas. I mean it sounds like you guys are really backed up there and have got some \u2013 I think some capacity constraints, is what you were suggesting. I'm just \u2013 do you have enough in backlog now essentially to carry you through a lot of 2018 in that area?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","If you look at \u2013 I mean we were talking about the G3600 engine specifically. And if you look at the backlog for that particular product, which is only a percentage of Energy & Transportation's backlog, we are taking orders well into next year for that product, but I think I would be hesitant to draw too much conclusions from that for the broader Energy & Transportation segment, which has many other industries and many other products in there as well. And in those cases, the backlog would not be completely filled out for next year.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Rob Wertheimer. Rob, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","Hi. It's Melius Research, and thank you. Just wanted to ask one more on production capacity. As you guys have ramped into this solid recovery, how do your internal indicators look on your progress on lean, on safety and quality? I mean are there any warning signs flashing like you might have seen back in 2004, 2005, 2006? And then Jim mentioned ample capacity, I think. I mean can you do up to prior peak levels and\/or better as your production improves with the current production set or do you need to think about, if this continues another year or two, adding capacity? Thanks.","Donald James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, Rob. I'll answer your last question first. We certainly have enough manufacturing capacity to meet the demand that we see over the next few years. Again, our issues have been with suppliers, and we're working our way through that. And answer to your first question, no, we don't see warning signs in terms of safety, quality, lean. We're very pleased with our performance there and just had a number of dealer meetings, and all the feedback is very, very positive about our quality, so.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","Great. Thanks.","Donald James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Andrew, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Wells Fargo Securities. Good morning, everybody.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning, Andy.","Donald James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","How are you?","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A question \u2013 I wanted to go back to the margin performance. I know it's only one quarter, but compared to the longer term potential ranges that you outlined in September, Construction was above, E&T kind of within the range; Resource slightly beneath, even though volumes remain at really low levels. How should we look at the short-term performance in the context of the longer term potential? I mean you've kind of demonstrated that you can hit those margins on lower run rate revenue. Should we expect lower incrementals going forward as you reinvest in the growth initiatives or should we kind of view this as potential there might be upside?","Donald James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. Andy, it's Jim. And I think just to clarify, I believe the only one of our three primary segments that is in or above the ranges is Construction Industries. If you look at the third quarter in RI and in E&T as well, they're actually both below the ranges that we outlined at Investor Day and certainly the year-to-date's are as well.","And maybe to answer your bigger question, our intent is to grow the company. And if in fact, we, CI as an example, were within that range or a bit above that range, our intent is to invest to grow as opposed to trying to just simply have higher margins every quarter. So we want to grow the business at a healthy margin rate, and that's really our focus. And also I'd caution you, we would expect to see some variation quarter to quarter. Some of our businesses are more lumpy than others. E&T and RI are more lumpy than CI, as an example. So we would expect to see margins jump around a bit due to mix and a whole variety of other issues. But again, our intent is to grow within our targeted ranges.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Jim. And then a last one again on margin. Q4, a few different questions have asked this, but the margins are going down sequentially on a kind of flattish revenue. You identified price cost as one of the headwinds. Could you quantify that? Is it a couple of hundred million or even higher?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","So I mean price \u2013 I'm not going to qualify, Andy, price and material costs. They're both negative. The biggest of the three would actually be investments in these targeted initiatives that we have. We've got several things. We talked about this. We're connecting more assets. We've got some R&D programs, the launch of the next-gen excavator that we're excited about. And so the bigger of the three increases are these targeted investments that started to pick up towards the end of the third quarter, will roll into the fourth quarter and then roll into 2018 as well.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","I think that's going to have to be the last question.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions and comments following the presentation. Now I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Mike DeWalt ","Hey, good morning everyone and we\u2019re very happy to have you with us this morning for our third quarter earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Strategic Services. And on the call today, I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.","Remember this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of todays call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com Web site, and it'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","Now this morning for sure we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate we believe could make actual results differ materially from our projections that can be found in the cautionary statements under Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2014 and our 10-Q filed with the SEC in August of 2014. And it\u2019s also in the forward-looking statements language contained in this morning\u2019s financial release.","In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in our financial release this morning and again that\u2019s been posted on our Web site at caterpillar.com.","So let\u2019s get started. I\u2019ll be covering three things this morning; our third quarter results, the increase in our profit outlook for 2014 and our preliminary outlook for 2015 sales and revenues. ","Now before I get into the quarter though I thought it might be helpful to summarize just a couple of themes from this morning\u2019s financial release, key points that we were trying to get across. And the first one is around stability and consistency. Last year and about this time we provided our first view of 2014 that was our preliminary outlook of sales and revenues for \u201914 that we did with our third quarter release.","Back then we said it looked to us like \u201914 would be relatively flat year with 2013, that was the case then that\u2019s about what\u2019s happened through the first nine months of this year and that\u2019s still our full year view today, so consistency. ","Second point is around profit, while sales and revenues for the first nine months of both 2013 and 2014 have been around $41 billion, profit per share is up year-to-date and every quarter of this year has been higher than the corresponding quarter of 2013. Profit per share so far to the first nine months of 2014 or $4.64 all in and $5.03 excluding restructuring and that\u2019s both of those are up from first nine months of last year which was $4.21. So, while there are number of puts and takes the point is we worked hard on operational execution and cost management and that\u2019s helped results.","Okay, with that let\u2019s turn to the third quarter. Sales and revenues were $13.5 billion and that was up about $100 million from $13.4 billion in the third quarter of last year. While sales and revenues didn\u2019t change much, profit per share rose from $1.45 last year to $1.63 this year or $1.72 without restructuring cost. The increase in profit per share in that increase still are number of puts and takes. On the positive side, price utilization was up, currency impacts both in operating profit and below the line and other income and expense were positive. Our share count was lower and that was positive for profit per share as well.","On the other side SG&A, R&D and manufacturing cost were a little higher, positives included material cost which were favorable but more than offset by higher employee incentive compensation, expense and a little higher warranty thoughts. The incentive compensation increase as a result of 2014 performance being well ahead of the targets we set when we started the year. ","Now results by segment; energy and transportation, sales were up $663 million or about 13%, their profit was up $250 million or about 29%. Most of that sales increase was from improved volume. And interim energy and transportation remember we have several different industries that we\u2019re serving. Oil & gas, power gen, transportation and that\u2019s rail and marine and industrial and that\u2019s where we sell engines to other equipment manufacturers.","Sales were up in all of those industries. Oil & Gas in industrial were up relatively in line with the segment average transportation grew a little faster than the segment average and power gen a little less than the average. The profit increase for the core energy and transportation in the quarter was largely result of the higher sales.","Now for construction industry, sales were down $98 million, the profit improved a $194 million or about 67%. Now for sales on the plus side construction had positive price realization. On the downside, volume was little lower and most of that was from dealer inventory reductions as dealers lowered inventories a little more in the third quarter of this year than they did in the third quarter of 2013 for construction. ","And user demand was also down slightly from the absence of the large sales of the Brazilian Government that we had last year and I mentioned that in our second quarter financial release. We also had little lower demand throughout most of Asia including China and weakness in the Middle East and in the CIS. On the plus side demand was up in North America and we had a small improvement in Europe.","The profit improvement was a result of the positive price realization, some of the currency impacts and favorable manufacturing cost. In resource industries, which is principally mining sales were down $496 million or about 19% from the third quarter of last year and profit was off $239 million or about 62%. The decline in sales was primarily lower volume. Price realization wasn\u2019t significantly different one way or the other. ","The volume decline was largely a continuation of what we\u2019ve been saying all year. While overall mine production has been good and many of the global mining companies are improving their performance, their purchases of new equipment are at low levels.","While sales this year are below last year; the 2014 quarterly sales trend has been pretty stable. The 2.1 billion in the first quarter, 2.2 billion in the second quarter and 2.2 billion in the third quarter not a lot of change quarter-to-quarter as we progress through the year.","The decline in profit from the third quarter of last year was primarily a result of the lower sales. While profit in resource industry is down from the year ago much like the sales it\u2019s been in a fairly tight ban [ph] throughout 2014. In the first quarter, profit was $149 million, second quarter was $133 million and third quarter was $147 million.","Again similar to sales it\u2019s been pretty stable but at low level. Our financial product segment revenues were up 44 million and operating profit was up too, so not much change from a year ago.","Now before I move on to the outlook I\u2019d like to touch on the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated another 1.4 billion of machinery and energy and transportation operating cash flow this quarter and are $5.4 billion through the first three quarters of 2014. Our balance sheet remains strong with the machinery, energy and transportation debt-to-total capital ratio less than 35% which is comfortably towards the low end of our desired range. Given the current demand environment, we generally have the capacity we need and CapEx expectations this year are less than 2 billion.","Our strong cash flows enabled us to repurchase 4.2 billion of stock so far this year and we announced an increase of 17% in the quarterly dividend last June. And we\u2019ve maintained a healthy cash balance at about 6 billion with the ability to invest. ","With that let\u2019s turn to the outlook. For 2014, we now expect sales and revenues to be about $55 billion which was the mid-point of our previous $54 billion to $56 billion outlook range. We have however increased our profit outlook for the year. Previously at the $55 billion mid-point of our sales and revenues range with expected profit at about $5.75 a share or $6.20 excluding the restructuring cost. We\u2019re pleased this morning to announce that we\u2019ve raised that to $6 a share all-in and $6.50 excluding the restructuring cost.","Now in addition to the outlook for 2014, as we typically do in our third quarter financial release we provided what we call preliminary outlook for next year sales and revenues. As we look towards 2015 from an economic perspective, we think there is a reasonable likelihood the world economic growth can improve that in 2015. In the developed countries, growth-oriented monetary policies we think could support continued modest improvement. ","In developing countries several governments raised interest rates for constraint liquidity in 2013 to either control inflation or protect exchange rates. And those measures slowed growth in 2014. More recently interest rates in some of those countries have stabilized and we\u2019ve seen the first monetary policy easing in the third quarter of 2014.","In addition, we think there is some potential for increased investment infrastructure particularly in countries like United States if we could get a highway built India and Turkey. Despite cautious optimism for improved global economic growth, significant risks and uncertainties remain and that could temper growth in \u201915.","Political conflicts and social unrest continue to disrupt economic activity in several regions, in particular in the CIS, Africa and the Middle East. In addition, the Chinese governments push from structural reform has slowed growth some and the ongoing uncertainty around the direction and timing of fiscal policy and monetary policy in the U.S. could temper business confidence. As a result of all that, our preliminary outlook for 2015 sales and revenues is flat to slightly up. ","Now one thing you won\u2019t find in this morning\u2019s release is the discussion about 2015 profit. That\u2019s typical for this time of year, and we start our planning process with sales, we provide a top line view of next year\u2019s sales with our third quarter release, we completed our planning process in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll provide a more complete view of 2015 in our January release along with our yearend 2014 results.","So, in summary, profit per share was up in the third quarter. We had another good solid quarter of cash flow, our sales outlook for \u201914 is similar to our previous outlook and we raised the profit outlook for 2014. Our preliminary outlook for \u201915 is flat to slightly up. So, with that we\u2019re ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","","Thank you very much; ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Thank you very much, we\u2019ll take our first question from Ted Grace, please announce your affiliation and post your question.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna ","Mike, I know you said that you didn't want to give too much on -- or really any guidance on profitability, but could you speak to at least --? ","Mike DeWalt ","","But you\u2019re going to ask anyway right?","Ted Grace - Susquehanna ","Well, no, what I was going to say, as a starting point, could you frame out at least across the three segments how you're thinking about each in the context of sales being flat to up slightly? Where would you have the most optimism, the most caution and maybe start there? ","Doug Oberhelman","","Yes, I think in the scheme of things our view around each of the segments is much like the total I don\u2019t think we don\u2019t see big swings up or down really in any of the segment. I mean it\u2019s always as you know looking out that far is tough to always be exact but or ever be exact I guess but by and large we don\u2019t see a lot of change going forward in any of the three segments.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna ","Okay. And the second thing I was hoping to ask either you or Doug is one of the big initiatives you've talked a lot about is making the Company a lot more nimble and kind of reactive to the demand environment that gets served to the Company, something that's outside your control. Can you just speak to the progress you've made in 2014 and how you think that sets you up for 2015 and to the degree you can talk about specific metrics whether it's cycle times or philosophy that would be great? ","Doug Oberhelman ","","That actually used to be a quite long answer delving into operations I think, what I\u2019ll do is kind of summarize it for you a little bit. One of the key metrics that we\u2019ve that kind of measures the success or failure of that is the incremental operating profit pull through. We have had target of around 25% and we\u2019ve taken the actions needed to be flexible enough to achieve that. But embedded in that there are lean helps if you would improve cycle times that helps were down that path but I think the ultimate measure of this is when either profit goes up or goes down do we have the flexibility that take cost out going down and I think we\u2019ve shown that we do.","Doug Oberhelman","","Well, just to add that Mike it\u2019s Doug here and I agree with that completely. In terms of really lean manufacturing lean six sigma standard work it\u2019s -- I think we\u2019re still early in the process here. We probably got about a third of our sales where manufacturing anyway covered to some with where we want to be in our first wave of lean really deeply manufacturing in every one of those cases whether it\u2019s a medium wheel loader line in Aurora, Illinois. Wheeled excavators in Grenoble, France and I can go on, certain solar is a good example of that too, we\u2019ve seen really tremendous improvements in quality in throughput, in inventory, in almost all metrics and we\u2019re encouraged. But there is a lot more work to do and as I said to you all many times, we really expect to see big chunks of this coming in \u201914 and \u201915 I think we saw some of that, some of year-to-date numbers we certainly have seen it in the quality of margins in the third quarter but in my mind we still got plenty of work to do on that. I also said earlier today that, in a way flat production really gives us time -- production output gives us time to get to work on this, when things are booming it\u2019s hard to work on efficiency because we\u2019re trying to satisfy the market in \u201813 when the bottom fell out in mining we\u2019re cutting cost at every moment and we really can\u2019t think about how we want to organize a manufacturing line. Well, since mid \u201812 or so certainly the \u201813 and \u201814 in construction and in energy and transportation that team has been doing that and shows in the margins.","Mining will be next, the mining recoveries will really I think prove what we can do with that because a lot of that work is being done now too. So I think we\u2019ve seen a down payment on it, but in my mind there is more to come.","Operator","","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll take our next question from Eli Lustgarten. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research","Can we first talk a little bit about the fourth quarter as we look out I mean you\u2019re sort of giving us guidance of about a little over $14 billion and while I recognize there is about $0.15, $0.16 from lower taxes and foreign currency in this quarter, your guidance, your midpoint of guidance, $1.47 or so for the numbers, can you give us a bridge why the fourth quarter will be -- with higher volume will be somewhat weaker profitability because you\u2019ve been pretty stable and production pretty stable in profitability for the year? Hello?","Operator","Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen, please remain on the line. We\u2019re going to get this up reconnected, one moment. Okay, gentlemen we are live.","Doug Oberhelman ","","Eli, could you ask it again we\u2019ve got cut-off, it was not -- ","","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research","I was wondering if I did something wrong or not. Okay, the first question very quickly, on the fourth quarter, you\u2019re guiding to a little bit over $14 billion. You\u2019ve been very stable in production, very stable in profits almost for the year. You\u2019re guiding us to lower numbers in the fourth quarter on profitability and I know there is like $0.16 of lower taxes and benefits and some currency in the quarter. Can you give us a bridge of what you\u2019re expecting in the fourth quarter it\u2019s different to drop the profitability to under $1.50 from the $1.60 that you have been doing?","Doug Oberhelman ","","Yes, you\u2019re right. With our fourth quarter outlook or our full year outlook it\u2019s not too hard to turn that into a forecast for the quarter and we do expect profit to be down a little bit in the fourth quarter. A couple of things that you mentioned we had currency gains in the quarter and there are lot of things that we think we can do a decent job of forecast and exchange rate is not one of them. So we\u2019re not forecasting changes in exchange rates from here. So there is no continuation of the gain.","We had favorable tax item in the quarter that goes away as well. So those are two positives that we\u2019re in the third quarter that won\u2019t be in the fourth quarter.","We typically have seasonally higher cost in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re wrapping up the year and discretionary spending tends to rise a bit, so that all happens essentially by almost every year but I can remember since I have been at the company. So we\u2019ve got that worked in. ","One other item probably I know is we expect a little bit of negative mix in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll have couple of a big electric power sale that we think will be completed in the fourth quarter at quite a bit lower margins than the total. So I think I would say mix seasonal cost and absence of the couple of the favorable items from the third quarter that pretty much bridges that I think.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research","Okay. And can we talk about the construction industries segment I mean you warned us in the second quarter about lower emerging market business taking $1 billion out of production. But we're hearing strong things, particularly in the US. In the quarter, we have emissions coming next year, so the dealers are saying that they're having trouble even getting inventory out of Caterpillar for some of the demands that they would want. Can you give us some insight of what you expect for the Construction Industries in the fourth quarter, and particularly as you go into next year because that should be one of your better quarters, particularly North America. ","Doug Oberhelman ","","I\u2019ll try to answer your question but I\u2019m going to try to answer another one that you kind of touched on but didn\u2019t actually ask directly and that\u2019s on inventories.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research"," ","Yes.","Mike DeWalt","","Sometimes I think there is confusion around dealer inventories. Since we sell through dealers, we frequently talk about changes in dealer inventory that kind of help give a complete picture of what\u2019s going on. But just because inventories go up or down doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re \u2013 themselves that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s well managed or poorly managed. There are lot of seasonal impacts that go on during the year in construction for example, we had a sizable increase in the first quarter in inventory and that kind of builds up for the spring and summer selling season and that it gets worked on for the rest of the year. That happened in the third quarter last year that happened in the third quarter this year, fourth quarter of that usually tends to happen as well. Dealers tend to sell a little more than we ship them. So, that occurred in the third quarter than it probably occur again next quarter.","In terms of construction, it\u2019s a mix bag around the world. We tend that we live in the U.S. and we get influence by what we hear in the U.S. a lot and it\u2019s been actually pretty positive, it\u2019s been quite a bright spot although, I wouldn\u2019t make the pitch that allow us better that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s great. We are I guess 7 to 8 years now past where the peak was and that was \u201806 and \u201907. So, we still have a ways to go to get to where we would think it\u2019s really good but it has been better. Other parts of the world it\u2019s a little bit of a different story. China has been week, our share there has been pretty good and rising but that doesn\u2019t offset a weaker industry.","Europe has been flat to slightly up for us which I think is a surprise to a lot of people but again you kind of have to think back to where it\u2019s come from and how low it got. My comment about U.S. not being back to peak goes even more so for Europe, there is a lot of room for Europe I think to improve; they can ever get economic growth kicked back in there.","So, that\u2019s a little bit of a rundown to the world.","Doug Oberhelman","","Hi Eli, it\u2019s Doug. I want to talk about the Tier 4 that you eluded to also and there is \u2013 we\u2019re in the throes of 2014-15 by the end of \u201915 virtually all construction equipment will have been, will be Tier 4 final compliant. And as we go through that were about halfway done maybe a little bit more than that right now in terms of individual models. That has as we phase out of Tier 4 interim and phase into Tier 4 final and again it\u2019s depending on horsepower size or kilowatt class that has doubled kind of the degree of difficulty in some of those assembly lines certainly around implementation. And we\u2019re seeing some of that availability go out you mentioned you heard that from dealers. I do too. I would expect that to continue for a little bit more but all of our product managers are all over it and I suspect by time we\u2019re done with Tier 4 final by the end of next year not before this will work its way through as well. We\u2019re really happy by the way with our Tier 4 final machines that are out there, a lot of them are running up a lot of hours and doing very very well in the marketplace. So, I assume as we work through this is kind of bubble of introductions I think we\u2019ll like what we see but it\u2019s a bit of challenge right now, you\u2019re right.","Operator","","Thank you very much, we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Casey, please announce your affiliation and post your question.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","","A couple of questions. First on E&T margin performance, Q3 obviously very strong at 20.1%. You talked about volume helping the quarter and then a negative mix going forward into Q4 because of the electric power contract. I'm just trying to understand how to handicap the impact of presumably lower US locomotive sales in 2015 on mix. Was there a positive mix in Q3 or was it all due to volume? ","Mike DeWalt ","","Well, there are several questions wrapped in there if we take locomotives specifically no doubt next year is going to be lower but that would if you just looking at locomotives that would actually be up positive for mix the margin of locomotive would be not the same as the segment average. So no, I don\u2019t think that would not have a negative mix impact next year. In fact, big sales of that in the fourth quarter would likely have would be another reason that fourth quarter mix might be a little weaker. I think it\u2019s probably a good time to kind of take that whole rail sector and kind of frame a bit how it could impact next year. Our view at least at this point is that certainly locomotive sales will be down, but remember our rail sector that industry, our business there has more than just new locomotives. We have a very large service business and then we have a pretty sizable parts business for locomotives and we have a healthy international business that we expect to be up actually next year.","So overall our view is that rail will have a negative but probably less than 2% impact on energy and transportation next year, hope that helps.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","It does, Mike. Thank you. And then if I could ask another question within E&T. There has been a lot of concern about some recent changes in commodity prices as it relates to oil. Could you kind of comment on maybe what percent of revenue is exposed to upstream production for oil and nat gas and then is there any point at which oil prices may start to impact demand? Thanks. ","Mike DeWalt ","","Yes, that\u2019s a good question Andy I know that\u2019s certainly been on everyone\u2019s mind with what\u2019s happened to oil prices over the last two weeks. And certainly lower oil prices on a particular help they\u2019re about where they were right now couple of years ago and our business didn\u2019t fall apart two years ago in oil and gas. So while it\u2019s not a big positive we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a significant negative as well, at least not where it\u2019s at now. You asked a question about how low would oil prices have to go and that\u2019s always kind of the sliding question it will depend a lot on where they were how long they stay, it\u2019s a very difficult question to answer.","I can\u2019t say that we\u2019re at now kind of where we have been over the last, not last year but a couple of years ago we were down at this level and again it wasn\u2019t all that negative. Remember the majority of our oil and gas business is gas compression and oil and gas production transformation. So production is a big driver in our business.","Also particularly for our turbine business, it tends to be pretty long term. The kind of projects that our customers are doing are big many of them multibillion dollar projects that go several years, most of those big oil companies they understand that there are short-term fluctuations in price and those big investment projects that they have in-flight which would effectively be in our backlog at the moment. They generally don\u2019t change those based on short-term fluctuation.","So all in all I would say we like to see a little higher oil price but kind of where is at now we don\u2019t see it having a big negative impact. ","One other just minor point maybe around that and that is the dividend that could play through potentially in other parts of the business. When oil prices are down there is usually a pretty direct consumer impact of that purchasing gasoline and lower price of oil leads to a lower pump price which puts a little more money in everybody\u2019s pocket.","So maybe that would be helpful for the economy overall.","Douglas Oberhelman","","I just want to add here its Doug here again. We are obviously watching oil and gas prices very closely. We are talking to, trying to stay close to our customers on this and what they\u2019re saying and I think you\u2019re seeing their quarterly announcements come out and generally the feedback we\u2019ve been getting that say 80 to 90 somewhere in there on a sustain basis. Certainly we\u2019ll take that really educated top half of it but there is plenty of room for reinvestment like Mike said it\u2019s still where it was a couple of years ago. ","I think you see low 70s on a sustain basis, there would be a chill cross the market and I\u2019d say gas coming down below three substantially on a sustain basis may do that as well. The other wildcard here that we\u2019re really anxious about and looking forward to is Mexico opening and that the oil and gas industry there is about to go over carefully that will. They\u2019ve passed laws down there; they\u2019ve made changes in the industry. That\u2019s going to go at almost any oil or gas price. So there is so many moving parts on this all over the world that is just hard to predict, but U.S. mid-80s we think is on a sustainable level we can all live with.","Operator","","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll take our next question from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Good morning. I think just following up on that theme, one of the things that Komatsu has said recently and not to quote a competitor, but I\u2019d be interested in your comments on it, is that a lot of their construction equipment is being supported by domestic oil and gas also. Can you talk about that a little bit, Doug and then what indirect impact might that have if oil prices were to fall to the low 70s? ","Doug Oberhelman ","","Yes, sure and I think that\u2019s right we do see we\u2019ve seen everything from pad preparation to road building around all the shale zones in the country and that has impacted to some degree our construction equipment I don\u2019t think it\u2019s probably going to move the needle, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s material but it would certainly impact at a little bit in our case. Again we get down to low 70s a lot of best we\u2019re going to change on a lot of things and there is no doubt that would be impacted to some degree I would agree with that.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","","So in your view, Doug, and most of the increase in construction equipment plans you're seeing now in the U.S. are pure resi and non-resi construction-driven? ","Doug Oberhelman ","","I would say yes, it\u2019s across the table I mean across the board yes, yes.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Okay.","Doug Oberhelman ","","Certainly, the fracing site preparation has been a help but boy we\u2019re seeing kind of across the board steady growth lower than we like but steady growth in the other businesses as well for construction equipment.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Okay, thank you. Just a clarification on your outlook for 2015. You said in the US you were hopeful that we would get a Highway Bill. Is that included in your outlook or would that be upside to your outlook? ","Doug Oberhelman ","","I don\u2019t know if I said I was hopeful but I said it could be upside but there is a possibility and it depends on a lot things in congress. I think in terms of India, we\u2019re definitely going to see infrastructure spending increase at a significant rate. We mentioned Turkey in the right up I\u2019m also optimistic in Brazil although there is election there at this weekend but both candidates, both parties are talking about reflecting the economy and Brazil is always used infrastructure as a way to do that.","In our case, we could see some kind of either a steady extension of what we\u2019re doing or a bit up as congress prices stimulate the economy or do what they do but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m hopeful but it could happen I put it that way.","Mike DeWalt ","","Yes, and I made the comment a few minutes ago and I think there\u2019ve been a lot of elections this year I mean one of the U.S. is coming out so, hopefully we\u2019ll have a window where the government can work together to make some progress before the next election.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","In a lame-duck session indeed.","Mike DeWalt ","","No I don\u2019t think it would happen in the lame-duck although anything can happen but I would say it\u2019s more going into post-election in 2015 as maybe there is some consensus to try to get after job creation, grow the economy faster that could push on some element of tax reform a little bit and infrastructure, those would be the two things that have an outside chance of something happening but bigger than right now but I\u2019m not going to call it is going to happen.","Doug Oberhelman ","","Back to your regional point and we\u2019re not counting on a big upswing as a result of that, no.","Operator","","Thank you very much, we\u2019ll take our next question from Seth Weber, please announce your affiliation and pose your question. ","Seth Weber - RBC ","Mike, it sounds like you bumped up your restructuring cost expense a little bit this year to $450 million from $400 million. And it sounds like that's targeted at the mining, the Resource business. Can you give us any color on the incremental details or where you're stepping up the spending there? ","Mike DeWalt ","","Yes, actually I won\u2019t point anyone thing, we start the year by paying $400 million to $500 million and some of the projects we understood very specifically some were being studied and that was the reason we had a range in other words \u2013 that we might do some of that we might not do. Last quarter, our estimate was closer to 400 so we kind of revised it down a little bit, that estimate right now is closer to 450 so there are a couple of more things that we\u2019re doing, none of them are material, none of them would we want to fall out separately but the only thing we\u2019ve talked about separately that individually is pretty material is the European restructuring we did in construction.","So again, we started out the year saying 400 to 500 and I think we\u2019re going to basically come in there.","Doug Oberhelman ","","But just to clarify the vast majority of that is not resource industries or mining -- and around the construction equipment business. In fact, resource industries restructuring in 2014 of the 450s one of the smaller pieces.","Seth Weber - RBC ","Okay, thanks for that clarification. And then just on the performance of the business, I think you called out the mining -- the aftermarket parts sales were down. Could you talk about any color on the aftermarket order activity in the Resource business? ","Doug Oberhelman ","","For us sales and orders are pretty much the same thing, we turn around parts orders usually and about 24 hours so there is no significant backlog there. So one is about the same as the other. For the company overall, part sales were positive and I think seem to be starting to build some momentum and that\u2019s a good thing. Mining is still I would say weak and really not much change one way or the other.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Did you see any pickup sequentially in orders, aftermarket orders? ","Doug Oberhelman ","","No, we did not.","Operator","","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Volkmann. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies ","And I\u2019d actually like to go back. Doug, you were just talking about the restructuring that was mostly done in construction. And I guess I was under the impression certainly that the first half of 2014, construction margins were probably over earning a little bit. You guys built a fair amount of inventory I think. And so I guess I had assumed that those numbers were sort of not something I should think about as we move forward and yet there is a fair amount of restructuring going on here. I guess I\u2019m just having trouble trying to parse out how much of the restructuring has sort of permanently improved those construction margins and how much you had temporary things going on in 2014?","Mike DeWalt","","I\u2019ll answer that, this is Mike. So we\u2019re talking about construction here.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies","","Yes.","Mike DeWalt","","So in 2014 I think, this is maybe an odd way to say it but I think construction is a little bit and this is probably not the right choice or words but more back to normal. If you go back to starting in late \u201812 and throughout much of \u201813 in construction we were reducing inventory both ours and dealers and that had negative impacts on production, it was made price realization tougher. So I think 2013 was very tough year for construction because of that.","So, and I think this year if you look at dealer inventory changes I mean there have been changes by quarter, but by in large they\u2019re likely to end the year about where they started. Production levels are kind of matching demand in other words and have been pretty stable. So that the point that Doug made earlier that\u2019s really help efficiency and we don\u2019t have kind of the downward changes if you will. And in fact, you see part of that there are price realization this quarter versus a year ago. ","I think in terms of the restructuring charges there is a little bit of benefit in this year again much of it is around restructuring our Belgium facility and some of the benefits are in this year and more will be added in next year a bit and then after. So I think there is more to come in terms of restructuring benefits for construction.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then can you just update us, Mike I thought I remember you were going to try to reduce inventories in construction, maybe it was more broad than that, but something like 800 million this quarter and in Q4 and it looks like maybe you didn\u2019t quite get there. Can you just talk about how you feel about all that? ","Mike DeWalt ","","Yes, again this goes back. What we\u2019re talking about here is dealer inventory last quarter we said we thought that dealer inventory was going to come down somewhere around 800 million and this quarter dealer inventory went down 600 million. I would call that given your ability to forecast that all the moving parts of that side actually pretty good I think it\u2019s directionally what we thought it was going to be but I think the fourth quarter is probably going to be directionally what we thought it would be. And it\u2019s a couple of things part of it seasonality, construction adds to inventory. If you think about the Northern Hemisphere where you\u2019re in winter not a lot of activity going on then and so we tend to produce more and dealers tend to stock up. You can kind of smooth load things a little bit better and then it gets old throughout the rest of the year. That\u2019s pretty common that\u2019s happen this year.","We\u2019ve had absolute reductions that I wouldn\u2019t call seasonal in mining and that has continued although the reductions are little bit maybe less than they were a year ago, that dealer inventory is coming down and it\u2019s at a pretty low level right now. If I look at dealer inventory overall, I would say it\u2019s in pretty borrowing the seasonal changes that occur.","And I would it\u2019s in pretty good shape. We do not have a dealer inventory problem for say.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies","Okay. I appreciate it.","Operator","","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll take our next question from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","David Raso - ISI Group ","The question is on oil and gas, the order book. Can you give us some feel for where the order book is year-over-year and how far does it extend into 2015? And also how are you extrapolating that order book when you lay out your 2015 sales guidance? ","Mike DeWalt ","","Yes, okay, David. So I would say overall and this is one of the industries where we actually do have a little bit better visibility than say construction where relative to sales that order book is usually a little less. It turns over quicker. I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty healthy and in fact if you look at solar it\u2019s not it\u2019s actually roughly where it was a year ago it\u2019s not changed much during the year, if you look at the rest of energy and transportation in the reciprocating engine piece of it, it\u2019s up we had a nice increase in the third quarter and I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty healthy levels.","When we forecast next year we don\u2019t just look at the backlog and forecast forward, it\u2019s more like we\u2019re out there trying to figure out what we think will actually happen in terms of sales then we use the backlog as maybe kind of a reality check to see if that makes sense. So, I would say for energy and transportation, we still have a pretty good backlog.","David Raso - ISI Group ","And to be clear though, oil and gas within E&T was my questions. So can I take that reciprocating comment as similar to what you have in oil and gas, up on recip and flat on solar? ","Doug Oberhelman ","","So what I would \u2013 I gave you a solar because that\u2019s mostly oil and gas. The recip -- factories we build engines they get sold into different application. So, the data that I see around backlog is around product not end market necessarily. So, but I would tell you I think anecdotally a lot of the strength has actually been oil and gas.","David Raso - ISI Group ","","Okay. And then lastly, on the puts and takes for 2015, I know we're not giving an earnings guidance, but just trying to think of the moving parts, things we've said in the past. Do they still stand for restructuring savings for next year? Any carryover or incremental benefits from repo, the short-term incentive comp? I know you bumped it up to $1.3 billion today for this year. Just trying to think about those puts and takes and maybe a comment on pension. Just something to frame the puts and takes for the 2015 earnings model. ","Brad Halverson","","David, this is Brad Halverson, I\u2019ll take a shot at this without giving you guidance for 2015 but try to tell you how we think about it internally. We remain very committed to our flow through target and operating profit of 25% and the way up and 25 to 30 in the way down. We\u2019ve demonstrated that, demonstrated it as well this year with our proxy bidding up year-to-date with sales being down and that\u2019s driving focus across all of the units in terms of restructuring, lean I would say also improve [Technical Difficulty] .","Doug Oberhelman","","David, we lost the line again we\u2019re not sure why, I\u2019m not sure how far we --.","David Raso - ISI Group ","Brad, if you can hear me, I basically -- you started to talk about a little bit beyond the comment of incremental is 25% on the way up, 25% to 30% on the way down and just how the segments (multiple speakers). ","Brad Halverson","Yes, I was just trying to give you a flavor of how we\u2019re looking at it without giving guidance and if I repeat something we\u2019ll just do that since we\u2019re starting over here but yes, we talked a little bit about being nimble earlier somebody made the comment, we feel that internally and we think it\u2019s driving kind of our flexible cost structure is driving our delivery around incremental and decrementals again we\u2019re happy that profit is up with sales actually being down on a year-to-date basis. And so it\u2019s driving a lean initiative, it\u2019s driving the restructuring efforts division by division and its driving I would say pretty strong supplier collaboration as we look to improve our margins and so if we look out to next year we have targets across each of our segments for incremental and decremental margins. If we were to get some sales growth next year as we said sales could be flat upside assuming we get some sales growth. We remain committed to that 25% incremental pull through. ","I think the other question here color about pension and we wouldn\u2019t see much of a change in pension year-over-year in terms of our pension cost.","David Raso - ISI Group ","","Obviously flat sales or sales don't move up or down much, incrementals are a little less telling. It's a law of small numbers. So I think what we are just trying to figure out -- we used to speak of restructuring savings over time being $400 million to $500 million with -- a lot of the savings after 2015 would be significant, but even 2014 I think we used to speak of maybe a couple hundred million of savings, trying to think what that number could be in savings for next year, again, trying to think through the repo. And we can all make our own projections around sales, but we're just trying to think of non-volume sensitive items. ","Mike DeWalt ","","Yes, I think in terms of kind of giving more guidance again. If you look at this year and you look at our original outlook again we\u2019ve been certainly surprised with some operational items particularly our margin and we\u2019ve also been helped in last quarter by currency but I think clearly at an operational basis we\u2019re really happy with where our margins are relative to flat sales and we see them, moving forward we see to be absolutely committed to the 25% growth which we think is a pretty good number.","David Raso - ISI Group","All right. I appreciate the non-answer. ","Doug Oberhelman ","","We\u2019re not trying to be tricky on profit we just didn\u2019t make a profit outlook and we trying to really hard to give all the pieces that make a profit outlook for next year that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s terrible that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s great, it just means that we didn\u2019t get an outlook.","David Raso - ISI Group","","But can you at least -- the one thing though, the restructuring savings that we used to speak to 400 million to 500 million by exiting \u201815, how much of those savings do you think you will have captured in \u201814 and at least some concept of \u201815 just on that one item? ","Doug Oberhelman ","","I suspect we\u2019ll talk more about that in January. We have savings in \u201814 and we\u2019ll certainly have more in \u201815.","Operator","","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Fisher. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Steven Fisher - UBS ","Can you guys talk about how the rental channel is influencing your construction sales in 2014 and how do you see that in 2015? And I guess how is demand in construction outside the rental channel? ","Mike DeWalt ","","Well that\u2019s a good question. Actually rental has been affecting the business I would say increasingly for I don\u2019t know 10, 15 years. And particularly when times are more uncertain customers have the tendency to rent more. Remember we tend to not sell through rental houses we sell the CAT dealers who are in the rental business. And we\u2019ve had particularly in the U.S. we\u2019ve had positive sales through the rental channel and positive sales through the end user owner channel I don\u2019t think there is anything out there that is driving a big structural change that impacted \u201814 or that will drive a big directional change in \u201815. But I think it is true that as customers get more and more focused on asset utilization, the rental channel can be more attractive. That\u2019s why we\u2019re big time in the rental business. It\u2019s a key element of the across the table initiative I mean it\u2019s a definite part of the channel here to say. ","Mike DeWalt ","","Okay, so both channels sound like they are up this year, is that right?","Mike DeWalt ","","Yes. Well the North America.","Steven Fisher - UBS","","Right, sure. And then, Mike, you mentioned a lot of room for growth in European construction. How do you feel about the visibility of European construction right now? Is your base case for next year that that\u2019s maybe flat? ","Mike DeWalt ","","Yes, when you look at construction and I kind of touched on this a little bit ago. There are two parts of the business, parts for example where we have little to no backlog because we get an order we ship, we get an order we ship it. So it\u2019s not the kind of thing that lands to a lot of visibility based on a backlog. Then construction is a little bit like that to generally when our customer or a dealer orders kind of on average they get it in a few months. ","So the backlog isn\u2019t quite like it would be for maybe a big turbine or a big mining truck. So, again I would say construction we forecast based on what we think is going to happen economically where the market is relative to replacements, we look at where dealer inventory and we\u2019re taking a lot of factors, backlog and short-term visibility don\u2019t play into construction or part sales that all as much as they do in some of the other parts.","So I guess bottom line, it was a long-winded answer to say within construction it\u2019s normal not to have a lot of concrete visibility to a backlog.","Steven Fisher \u2013 UBS","So the baseline probably would be about flat is your expectation for next year in Europe? ","Mike DeWalt ","","I think that\u2019s the case for all of our -- I mean this is worldwide comment but for all of our segments. We said flat to slightly up next year and we don\u2019t see either energy or transportation, construction or resource industries being kind of far from that. It looks pretty flat up a little for much of the business.","","Mike DeWalt ","","All right. We are at top of the hour so we\u2019ll sign-off.

Jim?","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thank you, Amy. I'd like to start by congratulating our team on another impressive quarter. Our operational performance was excellent. As demand increased, we did a good job managing cost and improved profit margins. A number of our markets remain challenged, but there were improvements in a few of our key markets this quarter. Construction in China and gas compression in North America were highlights. Mining and oil related activities have come off recent lows and we're seeing improving demand for construction in most regions. Based on our solid year-to-date performance and current order and activity, we're raising the midpoint of our 2017 sales and revenue by $3.5 billion to $43 billion, which would represent an increase of 12% over 2016. We're also raising our 2017 outlook for adjusted profit per share from $3.75 to $5.","We remain committed to our lean manufacturing journey to improve efficiencies and reduce lead times, and we continue to execute our restructuring plans to achieve a more competitive cost structure. We remain vigilant about product quality and will continue to invest in R&D to improve current and future products and solutions. In the second half of this year, we'll make targeted investments to improve competitiveness and drive long-term profitable growth. We'll continue investing to expand our digital capabilities and accelerate important product development programs. We're moving forward to ensure we're helping our customers harness the power of data and technology to be as productive and efficient as possible.","Caterpillar already has the largest connected industrial fleet in the world. We have more than half a million assets connected today and intend to significantly increase our connected assets by year-end. I want to emphasize these are targeted investments in key initiatives, and we'll maintain a strong focus on controlling our structural costs moving forward. Before I turn it over to Brad to discuss the details of the quarter and the outlook, a quick update on our strategic planning committee. We've completed our review of the business, and I look forward to sharing our strategy at Investor Day on September 12 at our demonstration facility in Tinaja Hills, Arizona.","With that, I'll turn it over to Brad to walk through the quarter.","Bradley M. Halverson - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Jim. As Jim stated, the second quarter continued what has been a great start to 2017. Before I walk through the announcements for the quarter and the revised outlook, let's turn to slide four, and I will walk quickly through the headline numbers. Sales and revenues of $11.3 billion were up about 10% from the second quarter of last year. While many of our end markets are far off previous peaks, we are starting to see several markets recover, and demand for China construction and North America gas compressions remain strong.","Sales were higher in all three primary product segments, led by Construction Industries, followed by Resource Industries, and then Energy and Transportation. Profit per share was up $0.42 from $0.93 to $1.35. We continued to execute on our restructuring plan which includes the closure and consolidation of more than 30 facilities. These actions are important to achieving the flexible cost structure required to remain profitable through the cycles. At the same time, we are thoughtfully preserving the capacity needed to meet future growth needs.","As a result of restructuring actions, we incurred $169 million in restructuring costs in the quarter, $30 million more than in the second quarter of 2016. In the quarter, we also recognized a pre-tax gain of $85 million on the sale of our investment in IronPlanet. Adjusted profit per share was up $0.40 from $1.09 in the second quarter of 2016 to $1.49. Higher sales, including a favorable mix, were the primary drivers of the profit improvement. Improved price on lower variable manufacturing costs were about offset by higher period cost due to an increase to the short-term incentive compensation accrual that resulted from the upward revision to the outlook.","Now let's turn to slide five. Second quarter operating profit was $1.251 billion as compared with $785 million in 2016, up $466 million. Operating profit pull-through in the quarter was nearly 50%. Positive changes to operating profit came from several areas. The largest increase to profit was a result of higher sales volume and favorable mix. All four geographic regions and all three primary product segments saw higher sales and revenues. However, increases to sales and revenues were largely concentrated in four end markets.","China construction and North America gas compression continued to experience strength, and robust overhaul and maintenance activity drove higher aftermarket parts sales for both mining and well servicing equipment. Price improved $183 million in the quarter. The favorable change was largely due to Construction Industries as Resource Industries and Energy and Transportation price realization were about flat.","Variable manufacturing costs were favorable $44 million, largely due to the favorable impact of period cost absorbed as inventories increased in the quarter in many of our factories to support higher production. As we ramp up production, we remain focused on lean principles, and we are working diligently to bring production up quickly but also efficiently. Material costs were about flat in the quarter. While our design and procurement teams continue to work on projects to lower material costs through redesign and resourcing, we expect higher steel cost to put pressure on material cost in the second half.","So while period costs were higher by $237 million, in the quarter we accrued about $330 million more short-term incentive compensation for ME&T than the second quarter of last year. When exclude the higher STIP accrual, period costs were lower by about $80 million driven by restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year that are focused on lowering the company's embedded cost structure.","As we have weathered through the challenges of the last few years, maintaining a strong balance sheet has been a priority and we are continuing that focus.","ME&T operating cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and is $3.6 billion year-to-date, both well above prior year comparables. ME&T debt-to-cap at the end of the quarter was 38.6%, well within our targeted range. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in enterprise cash, and in June the board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend which we expect will make 2017 the 24th year in a row of paying higher dividends to our shareholders.","Now let's move on to discuss each of the segments, and we'll start with slide six. Construction Industry sales were up 11% to $4.9 billion. Higher sales volume to Asia Pacific and Latin America and favorable price realization contributed to the increase. Most of the sales increase in the quarter for Construction Industries was driven by what has continued to be strong end user demand in China for construction equipment, most notably excavators. Through the first half of the year, the 10 ton and above excavator industry in China was up about 130% from last year.","Strength in China continues to be driven by government support for infrastructure and strong residential investment. Sales in China in the second quarter were better than we had expected, and we now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year.","If you look at the chart at the top of the right-hand side of slide six, it shows China industry sales for 10 ton and above sized excavators from 2006 through 2017 forecast. You can see from the chart that while demand for 10 ton and above excavators is up significantly versus the last two years, it is still far below highs achieved earlier this decade. Continued strength in China is dependent on underlying demand, government support and accommodating credit conditions","For Latin America, sales were higher due to an increase in end user demand across several South American countries as well as favorable dealer inventory changes. While we saw some regions improve in the quarter, Latin America, especially Brazil, remained challenged, and sales are still at very low levels.","North America sales to end users were up and price realization improved. However, these were mostly offset by a drop in dealer inventory. North America dealers typically pull from inventory in the second quarter to support the strong selling season. However, this year the reduction in dealer inventory drawdown was greater than last year, resulting in an unfavorable impact to sale. As you can see in the chart on the bottom right-hand side of the slide, higher end user demand in North America was primarily driven by improved residential and non-residential construction.","As the chart also shows, infrastructure spend in the U.S. has been stagnant for some time, and sales of construction equipment for infrastructure projects was down in the quarter as we have yet to see federal, state and local funding for road projects translate into higher sales.","The United States is in need of infrastructure investment. Passage of a federal infrastructure bill would be positive for our country and our business. As expected, in the middle of the spring and summer selling season, the backlog for construction industries was down from the first quarter of 2017. However, the decrease this quarter of about $300 million was less than the first quarter to second quarter reductions in both 2015 and 2016 when the backlog went down by $1 billion and $900 million respectively. Order rates were strong in the quarter with all regions seeing an improvement from year ago.","Let's move to slide seven. Construction Industries segment profit was favorable by about $350 million driven by favorable price realization and higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products. Period costs were about flat as higher short-term incentive compensation expense was largely offset by restructuring and cost reduction actions. Construction Industries was an early adopter of our operating and execution model, and this focus has helped to improve their segment profitability. Segment profit margin in the quarter was 18.2%, an increase of almost 600 basis points from the second quarter of last year.","Let's move to slide eight and Resource Industries. Continued strong demand for after-market parts to support overhauls and maintenance work combined with favorable changes to dealer inventories were the primary drivers of the $300 million increase in sales and revenues for Resource Industries; an increase of 21%. In order to call a recovery in mining, we have said that first the excess machine inventory in the mines would need to be worked off. Then demand for overhauls and maintenance would drive higher aftermarket part sales. And last, orders for new equipment would start to increase.","The cycle is starting to play out. Utilization on trucks is up 4% from last year. The part fleet continues to come down, and for the fifth quarter in a row, part sales have increased to support rebuild and maintenance needs as well as higher utilization of fleets in the mines. And our order rates are improving. After four years of dealers reducing their inventories, for the second sequential quarter, dealer inventory held about flat. Sales increases and favorable dealer inventory changes were broad based across all regions.","As you saw in the sales to user numbers that were released yesterday, RI sales to users were about flat in the quarter. However, we believe sales to users are a lagging indicator of industry trend. Order rates in the quarter were up more than double the second quarter of last year. The backlog for Resource Industries was up about $300 million from the end of the first quarter 2017, and Resource Industries was a significant part of the $3 billion increase in the backlog since the second quarter of last year. However, while Resource Industries has started to recover, sales volumes remain at historically low level.","We'll move to slide nine and look at their operating performance. On improving sales with a focus on operational performance, Resource Industries delivered a solid quarter. Segment profit was $97 million, up $260 million from a loss of $163 million in 2016. The improvement in profit resulted from higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products and lower period cost. Resource Industries continues to implement a number of restructuring actions to lower their breakeven point. These initiatives enabled them to deliver lower period cost in the quarter even after recognizing a large increase in short-term incentive compensation expense. Resource Industries incurred additional warranty expense of a little over $50 million in the quarter for a customer program we do not expect to repeat.","Next we'll go through Energy and Transportation on slide ten. Sales were up $200 million or 5% in the quarter to $3.9 billion. Higher sales into oil and gas combined with higher industrial aftermarket sales were the primary drivers of the sales increase. Sales into power generation were about flat as a slight improvement in North America was mostly offset by weaknesses in other regions. Transportation sales decreased, largely due to lower demand for marine application. Sales into the rail industry were about flat. While the rail industry remains weak and the number of stored locomotives remains elevated, this was mostly offset in the quarter by an increase in rail services to support higher rail traffic.","The chart on the right side of slide 10 shows the four-year history of U.S. rig counts and west Texas intermediate oil prices. The number of rigs in production has doubled from recent lows reached in May of 2016. U.S. oil production has increased accordingly. In the areas where we participate in the oil and gas market, the recent strength has largely been concentrated to well servicing and midstream gas compression applications.","Demand for aftermarket parts to support overhaul and maintenance of well servicing fleets increased in the quarter, primarily to support rigs that are going back to work in the Permian Basin and other shale formations in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico where the cost of production and transportation is low enough to encourage investment despite recent oil price volatility.","Midstream gas compression is having another good year as we support the continued buildout of North America's natural gas infrastructure. In addition, recent developments in the Permian in the last 12 months have had a higher concentration of natural gas than previous wells. This discovery has contributed to a higher demand for 3500 and 3600 reciprocating engines to support the midstream gas compression growth in that region.","We move to slide 11; we'll look at the segment for Energy and Transportation. Energy and Transportation profit was up $98 million from $602 million to $700 million. This was largely attributable to higher sales volume, a favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material cost. Period cost increased in the quarter but were about flat after excluding higher short term incentive compensation expense.","Before I move on to the outlook, a quick comment on financial products. Operating profit was down slightly due to the absence of the sale of securities at Cat Insurance Services. The portfolio remains healthy with past dues down 22 basis points in the second quarter of 2016 and write-offs were down $7 million. Used equipment prices continued to improve which helped, and the team delivered a solid quarter. We'll move to slide 12, and we'll cover the outlook.","We announced this morning that we are raising the outlook for full year sales and revenues and profit per share. In April we provided an outlook for sales and revenues of $38 billion to $41 billion. As a result of strong operational performance in the first half, encouraging order rate, good economic indicators and a solid backlog, we are providing new guidance for sales and revenues in the range of $42 billion to $44 billion with a midpoint of $43 billion, up $3.5 billion from the prior outlook. At the midpoint of the sales and revenues range, we have raised the profit per share outlook to $3.50 per share and raised the adjusted profit per share outlook from $3.75 to $5.","We'll move on to slide 13 and cover the sales outlook by segment. We now expect Construction Industries sales for the year to be up 10% to 15% versus the previous outlook of flat to up 5%. This is driven largely by higher end user demand in both China and North America. Order rates for Construction Industries have been strong through the first half of the year across most regions with an exception of the Middle East and Brazil which remain challenged. The backlog is also up significantly from the second quarter of 2016. We do expect sales in the second half of the year to be slightly lower than the first half. For Construction Industries, the second quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year as construction activity and deliveries pick up to support the spring and summer construction season in the Northern Hemisphere. Fewer workdays due to holidays and vacations combined with the anticipation of colder weather typically drives sales lower in the second half. In China, on average for the last five years, over 55% of sales were realized in the first half of the year.","For Resource Industries, we now expect sales to be up 20% to 25% for the full year versus the previous outlook of up 10% to 15%. While we expect aftermarket part sales to remain strong through the rest of the year as the number of parked trucks is reduced and the demand for overhauls declines, we expect the rate of growth to slow, and for part sales to be lower in the second half than the first. However, we expect this will be more than offset by an increase in new equipment sales.","Energy and Transportation sales are forecasted to be up 5% to 10% for the year versus the previous outlook of about flat. We continue to see strong rebuild activity in well servicing for engines, transmission, pumps, and flow iron, and new equipment deliveries are expected to increase in the second half of the year. We also expect shipments to North America gas compression customers to be higher in the second half. Industrial, power generation and transportation are all expected to be about flat to slightly up.","We move to slide 14. At the midpoint of the sales and revenue range, the new outlook for profit per share is $3.50 and the revised outlook for adjusted profit per share is $5. The increase in the profit outlook since April is largely the result of the improved forecast for sales and revenues and disciplined cost control partially offset by an increase in short term incentive compensation expense. As compared to 2016 at the midpoint of the range, the revised outlook reflects higher sales and revenues of about $4.5 billion or 12%, and an increase in adjusted profit per share of $1.58. The increase in adjusted profit per share versus 2016 is largely driven by higher sales volume of $4.5 billion and the associated margin on those sales.","Favorable price, while we do not expect the same level of price favorability in the second half of the year, we still expect favorable price realization for the full year in a range of 0.5% to 1%. Favorable impact from period cost absorbed as inventories are expected to increase to support higher production level. These favorable items will be partially offset by higher short term incentive compensation expense of about $1 billion. Material costs are now expected to be about flat for the full year. While geopolitical uncertainty and commodity volatility continue to be risks to the outlook, our outlook assumes that oil prices remain bound within the recent range of volatility, markets stay resilient to geopolitical uncertainties, and China remains supportive of growth. However, changes to any of these variables as well as others could impact our sales and revenues outlook for the full year.","We'll turn to slide 15 and wrap up. Operational performance for the year has been strong with second quarter operating profit pull-through of nearly 50%. While a number of our end markets remain challenged, we see strong demand in deliveries for China construction and North America gas compression equipment. And demand for aftermarket parts has increased to support overhaul and maintenance activity for well servicing, gas compression, and mining equipment. Orders and end user demand for North American construction equipment also improved in the quarter. We continue to be focused on lean, product quality, and investing in the business for future growth. The balance sheet remains strong, and we delivered $2 billion in ME&T operating cash flow in the quarter. Given year to date performance and our confidence in the second half of the year, we are raising the outlook for both sales and revenues and profit per share.","With that, I'll turn it back to Amy.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Brad. And Kate, I think we're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. And our first question today is coming from Ross Gilardi. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Bank of America. Morning, guys.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Morning, Ross.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey Amy, on page six of the press release, it shows that Cat just increased its global flexible workforce for 3500 workers in the second quarter, and I think you're up about 35% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. And you haven't had a seasonal working cap workforce build like that since 2010. So first of all, where did you hire more people by business and geography? And then second, if you are ramping flexible employment, why are you still implying the 20% decline in second half earnings versus first half? I recognize all the puts and takes you just provided, but the workforce changes would perhaps suggest otherwise.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yes, so it's a great question. I think it's certainly a great change in where we've been over the last several years, is bringing back workforce. To your first question, where has it been, Ross, it's really been around the globe. Certainly China, sales are up. Brad mentioned industry up over 100% this year versus last. So that's been a significant growth in workforce. Lafayette, this is for the higher demand for the 3500 and 3600 engine. And beyond that, we're hiring in other factories around the globe, here in East Peoria. We're bringing people back to work in Pontiac. It's been pretty broad-based.","As far as the second half versus the first half, I think if you look at the comps for sales in the second half of the year versus the first half, they're actually up just about $1 billion so we are implying higher production. Production is higher in the second half than it was in the first half. So we can talk through some of the puts and takes on profitability, but we do expect production to be up in the second half of the year.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Do you have a follow-up?","Operator","Thank you.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. I also just wanted to ask on your capital spending, I think Cat's spending like 50% of depreciation right now, and as we just discussed, you're starting to hire people. When are you going to start reinvesting in the business again? And are there any areas of Caterpillar right now that are just structurally tight?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, I think if you're talking about fixed assets, bricks and mortar and machines, we continue our restructuring plan. We think at the end of those plans we'll have the capacity we need to meet our future growth needs. So we don't foresee that we have fixed capacity challenges. Really what we're seeing right now is we bring production back, we're coming back from pretty low levels. Jim talked about where we're investing in the business in the second half of the year, is through some targeted investments in key initiatives to advance our market of competitiveness, in digital to advance some product programs that we have. So that's where we see the second half investments back in the business scene.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","And that is driving some of the second half versus first half profitability.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Hi. Evercore ISI. I mean, this year I would say the most interesting thing has been the Construction Industry margins. I just wanted to get your perspective on how should we think about those margins going forward? Everybody has been sort of thinking about what normalized earnings could be for Cat mid cycle, and I'd say probably the biggest surprise this year has been those margins. Can you help us a bit with \u2013 you made the comment on mix. Is it geographic? Is it product? Just given the high level of margins we've seen so far this year.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, so for Construction Industries, and I think your point is a good one. They had impressive margins. Brad pointed that out, both in the first and the second quarter, up 600 basis points from a year ago. In the second half of the year, we do expect some headwinds to profitability. North America continues to be very competitive from a pricing perspective. We expect that to put pressure on Construction Industries' price realization in the second half. We still expect them to be favorable, slightly, but not as favorable as we've seen in the first half of the year. Say through the first half of 2017, we've clawed back the price that we lost in 2016, and we do expect some price pressures in the back half of the year, especially in North America.","Across all three of the primary product segments, we do expect material cost headwinds. We delivered about $50 million of material cost improvement in the first quarter. It was about flat this quarter. We expect that to reverse to about a $50 million headwind in the back half of the year. That's across all three segments. And Construction Industries also, and the other two primary segments, have some key initiatives they're planning on spending in the second half year. That all said, though, David, we would expect the segment margins for Construction Industries for the full year to be about 200 basis points than they were last year.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","But if \u2013 I mean, last year they were only 10.5%. You're running at 16%, 17% year to date. I mean, are you really implying margins that low? You're basically implying single digit margins in the back half of the year for CI?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, your numbers are a little different than ours. We add back the inner segment sales. But yeah, there is a pretty significant margin erosion that's implied in the outlook in the back half of the year for price, for higher material cost, and then to reflect these investments that we expect to make in the business.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Yeah, okay. I hear you. I'm just trying to understand structurally if we try to look out to 2018 and 2019. I appreciate the detail in the answer, but just trying to think about obviously setting up a little bit to September analyst meeting. When you think of the profitability of this segment now versus last cycle, for example, again, how much should we take to heart this first half run rate margin to some degree, even with the second half being lower? I'm just trying to get perspective how you're thinking about the segment moving forward.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, so and as you said, we'll certainly be discussing more on all three of the segments' margins as we get to the Analyst Day in September. Construction Industries was an early adopter of our operating execution model focused on OPEC profit generation. A 200 basis point improvement from last year is certainly something to be proud of. And they have \u2013 they continue to restructure. We've got Gosselies and Aurora that still we don't expect to see those improvements until 2019. Maybe we'll see some of that flow through in 2018. So I think we certainly see growth from here for Construction Industries' margin.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. Credit Suisse. I guess two questions. One on the resource side. The margins were a little lighter than I thought but then you mentioned you had $50 million of one-time warranty expense so it was actually more comparable to the first quarter. So given your increase in resource sales, how are we thinking about profitability and sort of the restructuring actions layering into 2017 and 2018? And then my second question, how much of your forecast in fiscal year 2017 is being hindered by your inability to ramp production? I mean, one of the things that dealers talk about is lead times extending. So if you could just sort of comment on that as well. Thanks.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sure, yep. Thanks, Jamie. So RI profitability. I think if you step back, we do expect sales to be slightly higher in the second half, as Brad mentioned. Part sales will come down a little bit, but that'll be more than offset by shipping out of the backlog for new equipment orders. That said, and I think if you neutralize for that higher warranty expense, we expect first half and second half profitability to be pretty similar on slightly higher sales in the second half. And that's driven by the steel cost pressures that we expect to see as we talked about in the last quarter. Resource Industries has a slightly less favorable geographic mix of product sales in the second half, and then also the investments that they're making to advance market competitiveness in digital and product programs.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Sorry, Amy. To be clear, the profit dollar similar, that's including the warranty expense in the second quarter? When you said second half versus first half, because that's a big difference.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. Plus or minus. Not giving exact numbers, we see the first half and the second half profitability to be pretty similar.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then sorry just lead times, capacity constraints, how much of your forecast is being hurt by that?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, I would say we don't see the forecast really being much impacted by capacity constraints, although as you mentioned, we have seen lead times go out. If you look at several of our products, the 3600 large mining trucks, demand for those products really shot up overnight. The large mining trucks now we expect for production to be triple what it was in 2016. Production for the 3600 has more than quadrupled from a year ago, and again, both of those products were at pretty low level so it does take time to get that demand back, especially through the supply chain and getting the workforce back to work. And we also have, as we're restructuring and seeing some really elevated level of demand in China for excavators and demand come back in North America for earth moving equipment with the restructuring of Gosselies.","While we've put those products on managed distribution, we do believe that we're getting product to the dealers to get to customer sales. However, we have seen a month of sales for dealer inventory come down, and it's a little lower right now than we would like it to be.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joel Tiss. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Bank of Montreal. I just wondered if you could give us a little setup. I'm not asking for a forecast on China for 2018. Seems like everything's a little buoyant because of the election this year and I just wondered if you could frame how do you think about 2018 a little bit?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, I think it's early for us to be thinking about 2018, but maybe I'll give a little color to where we're at for China excavator sales. If you look at the chart that Brad had in his presentation for 10 ton and above excavators, this year we expect the industry to sell about 55,000 excavators, up from about 30,000 excavators last year, so pretty significant increase.","We think \u2013 I think it is too early to forecast 2018. We do think that that is slightly above normal replacement demand for excavators, 10 ton and above excavators in China which we believe to be somewhere between 45,000 to 50,000. So we're probably this year just slightly above that normal replacement demand. Does that answer your question, Joel?","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nicole DeBlase. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. It's Deutsche Bank. Good morning, guys.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning, Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So you provided some detail around what you expect for resource and construction profitability. I know previously you had said kind of flattish margins for E&T. Is that still the case, or has that changed?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","So for Energy and Transportation what we would expect for margins is for first half profitability and second half profitability to be pretty similar.","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And when you say profitability, just to confirm, is that the absolute EBIT dollars or is that the margin percentage?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","That would be the margin percent, the margin percent.","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. Thanks. And secondly, going back to the China question. How would you characterize China inventories right now on the construction side? Is there still further restocking to come, or do you think that that process is pretty much complete?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","No, we think that there's still dealer restocking to come. So if you look at dealer inventories in China, we probably typically target about 2.5 months of sales. China's target for dealer inventory months of sale is a little lower than the rest of the world. They have less variety in the configurations they sell. We are about, quite a bit lower than that at the end of the second quarter, even though we did take dealer inventory up some. So we do expect to continue to be rebuilding dealer inventory levels through the back half of the year. But as I mentioned, certainly in China, the strong selling season for end users is in the first half.","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. JPMorgan.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. Can we talk a little bit more about these targeted investments and initiatives that are important to your future competitiveness? I mean, I thought that this was a pretty interesting portion of the press release and if you could give us some more examples of what exactly these investments are going to be, and what you mean by technology updates to your products.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","So it's pretty broad-based and I'd say it's pretty difficult to boil it down to a few bullet points, but I'll give you some highlights. One of the significant areas of focus is a bold goal for our business to connect more assets. So we believe we have the largest connected industrial fleet in the world at 530,000 assets. And we have a bold goal to go out and connect 100,000 more by the end of the year. We don't know if we'll get there, but that's certainly where we're moving the teams towards. And that requires the expense of buying the boxes and the labor cost to connect those assets. And certainly, that will benefit both our customers and us as we bring back that data and learn ways and use the data and the power of data to develop solutions to lower the cost and improve the productivity for customers. So that's one area.","Another would be expanding our e-distribution channel and the different solutions we have out there for customers. That's another area we're focused on. And then we're also spending money to advance some of our product programs, pull money into this year or push those product programs and make sure they have successful launches in the back half of the year.","Bradley M. Halverson - Caterpillar, Inc.","Ann, this is Brad Halverson. Maybe just another comment about how we use that language. We use that language because that's how we're operating internally. We have now been through four years of a downturn. It's been hard on us. We've taken significant restructuring activities and we like where our cost structure is at and where our balance sheet is at.","And so using our operating and execution model, Jim is really driving continued focus on cost reduction across the support areas, and as we increase period cost, you'll see that there'll be very targeted in areas that offer the most long term value for the company consistent with kind of the pools of OPACC we see out there in the future. And this is a little example in the second half of this year where we're going to take an opportunity to do a little bit of that where we think there's a lot of value and keep the lid on the other costs that we have in the company.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Brad or Jim, do you think it has impacted your competitiveness, the fact that you have been so focused on restructuring and cost reductions and some of your competitors are well ahead of you in terms of IT initiatives? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Bradley M. Halverson - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say, Ann, actually I think not because this time I've been in a career here at Cat a long time. Typically, we have reductions in areas that are easy to find. So we reduce R&D or reduce other things. In this downturn, if you look at our cost reduction, it's been highly targeted to areas that are not kind of future value. They're areas of efficiency and consolidation and support cost. We have really increased spending in many of the growth areas. We've protected R&D by and large, and we've protected things like digital spending. So we've taken an entirely different approach in this downturn in terms of where we took cost out and what cost we protected. So I would say it's different than we would have historically done.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll get back in line. Thanks.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. It's Goldman Sachs.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Morning. I'm wondering if you could say more about the contribution of the operating and execution business model in construction industries so far, what's been the impact on OPEC or margins, however you can frame that for us. And how far are we in that journey for construction at this point?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, I mean, I think it's been extremely impactful to Construction Industries' margins. You can go back several years and look at where their segment margin percents were and see that they've come quite a ways on down sales. So sales in 2017 still probably \u2013 I don't have the numbers in front of me, but 10% to 15% off of peak levels of sales volumes and much higher levels of segment margin. They've driven higher OPACC, just raw dollar OPACC over that timeframe, and that said, as all of the segments have worked on their operating and execution and OPACC improvement initiatives, Construction Industries still has projects lined up and improvements they expect to make in their OPACC.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And, Amy, on that last point, are we closer to the seventh inning? Or can you just frame that within construction specifically in terms of the number of projects in front of us?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. I think we'll give more color to that at the Analyst Day in September. But I think it's fair to say that they still have a pretty healthy sized list of profit improvements that they're focused on driving through their business.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And, Amy, as you folks build out the connected fleet and perhaps we can get more precision on how much (47:27) inventories are required, how are you folks thinking about required dealer inventories in this cycle compared to the last cycle? You spoke about the development in China, but I'm wondering how are you thinking about what's the right level of inventories and months of supply globally now and how that might be different versus the last cycle.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, I think that we have probably always held around a target of 3.5 to 4 months of sales of dealer inventory. I think if we're honest, we probably typically struggle to get there, and we're \u2013 would end the year a little north of four. I think that's about where we ended 2016. I don't know that our target for months of sales of dealer inventory has changed that much, but as we have seen volume come back pretty quickly in a few of our end markets, we have seen that months of sales drop below our 3.5 target.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joseph O'Dea. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning. It's Vertical Research.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Morning, Joe.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","First question is just on rebuild and overhaul activity in both mining and upstream oil and gas. Just to understand of what your visibility is on current levels of demand and then what a stepdown potentially looks like. And so just to kind of get an appreciation for how significant a stepdown you could see in aftermarket in mining in the back half of the year, and then do you see that at more kind of a sustainable level? Same thing for oil and gas. Do you see a big uptick in activity there? How long that persists? And then what kind of a headwind you face when that maybe comes down a little bit?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. I'll handle each one of those separately, Joe. So for mining, we do see part sales come down in the second half of the year. I wouldn't say that it's that significant. And I don't have a forecast for 2018 to give you of where we think part sales will be over time. We do expect some decline in part sales second half and first half, but it's not a double-digit number, but it is coming down. For oil and gas or really where we're seeing, as we talked about, the aftermarket parts demand is primarily in well servicing, and it has primarily been, as Brad talked about, in the Permian Basin and in other shale formations in that region, other parts of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, where the cost of oil production is still encouraging investment.","We haven't seen demand to date come down in those regions. We haven't seen a lot of increase in demand in other shale formations outside of that area. So without providing an outlook for 2018 or kind of guiding where I think we could go from here, certainly the oil price drives that. A significant stepdown would probably put some pressure on where we're seeing some strength today. But if we would start to see oil prices get back up over $50 and start to see some of the pipeline build-out that we need to help transportation, a few of the other shale formations, we could start to see those pick up. So I think it's really too early to call kind of where we go much out past the end of 2017.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I appreciate it. And then on resources specifically and the OE order side of things, I think you've commented on needing to see stabilization in commodity prices to encourage continued spend or growth in spend on replacement. We have seen some stabilization in some key commodities at levels that are well above where they were a year ago. So I guess just in terms of, are current commodity prices supportive enough and how long do you think we need to see a pattern of stabilization before that encourages a little bit more spend?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. So I do think \u2013 what I would say is if you look at the order rate in the second quarter, Brad mentioned that it was more than double from second quarter of last year. So I think without having the buying decisions of all of the miners in front of me, it's probably fair to conclude that at current commodity prices it's driving demand for investment. I think what's probably more important, and we've stressed this throughout the entire downside of mining, is that mine production continues to really increase or in some commodities stay about flat. So it's really an issue of making sure they have healthy operating equipment in the mines and when do they need to start to invest capital to keep their equipment running and functioning.","So I think commodity prices right now are supportive. They need to stay supportive. If we were to see change materially, that could change the story. But where they are right now, we are seeing healthy demand for mining equipment","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","But I will stress, but off of very low levels.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Sure.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","So last year, very low levels, but it's still at pretty low levels historically.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning. It's RBC. Just kind of following up on that last question, Amy, and your answer, I mean, given the kind of improving environment in Resource Industries, the commodities environment, et cetera, what do you think you need to see to get positive pricing in Resource Industries here going forward? Pricing was still negative. Is there something that's happening that's just causing pricing to continue to be tough?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think it's exactly my last comment, which is industry volumes still are at extremely low levels. So manufacturers have a lot of capacity and are trying to fill up their factories and earn and win every deal to do that. These are certainly very attractive both from the original sale and the after-market parts stream deals to win. So I think we really won't start to see price appreciation in Resource Industries until we start to see constraints in capacity amongst us and our competitors.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And if I could just ask a follow up. In response to an earlier question I heard some mention about supply chain. Can you talk about whether you're seeing any kind of pockets of pressure on the supply chain or how you're feeling about the supply chain here in this increasing demand environment? Thank you","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. So, as I mentioned, we are for a few products bringing production up quickly off of very low levels. It's difficult to get both \u2013 get the factories back to work and get the workforce in and trained. And so that is taking a little time. On top of that, we've had higher demand for aftermarket parts which also puts demand into the supply chain. I think we just think it takes time. We hope to be worked through most of those issues by the end of the year, and it is largely workforce and supply chain that's driving \u2013 that's, I'd say, setting the pace for how quickly we can bring production up.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And that's mostly on construction on the supply chain bottleneck?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","I would say that we have, depending on the product, we have supply chain issues we're working across the product line.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the answers. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Wells Fargo Securities. Good morning. Question on the Construction Industry 200 basis point margin increase for the year. Back to David's question that it really does imply a pretty sharp drop-off in the second half. And it's still a little bit confusing to me based on the commentary you gave about inner segment sale impacting that. Because if I look at the first half, you had $54 million or thereabouts in inner segment sales, and that's kind of small in the scope of the $9 billion first half sales reported.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yep.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is there an acceleration in the second half inner segment, or is \u2013 how should we look at that?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","No, it's not \u2013 I think from David's question, if I look at the margins that I referenced, he said single digits. I'm not quite to single digit numbers, so I was just clarifying his math. I think we were both probably in about the same place. I think the question stands though, we do see softer segment margin percent in the back half of the year for Construction Industries. Sales are down a little bit. That drives some of it, which is not unusual from a historical perspective for Construction Industries' sales to be down in the back half of the year. They do expect some price pressure, especially in North America. They expect some material cost pressures for steel and then some higher period cost spend to support these investments.","Joseph E. Creed - Caterpillar, Inc.","This is Joe Creed. I think we're focused on expanding margins in the segments and we have to be careful not to look at quarter-to-quarter margins in each of the segments because they can fluctuate from time to time inside the quarter. But on an annual basis, we're committed to the improvement.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, and so a 200 basis point improvement for the year certainly I think is something to denote impressive.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steven Fisher. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. It's UBS. Just to continue that discussion there, you mentioned a number of times the competitive price pressure you expect in the second half in construction, and you just clarified it's North America. Just curious, why will the competitive price pressure be more intense in the second half relative to the first half? Why wasn't that price pressure there in the first half?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","I'd say the price pressure has been there, but we expect it to continue. And we expect, I'd say our competitors, as we continue to see the strong dollar work against us from a competitive standpoint to put additional price pressure in the back half of the year, Steve.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And this may be a longer question than the last minute of the call, but what do you think is the most likely path to noticeably higher construction equipment sales in North America? I mean, in the past you've talked about 3% GDP growth driving fleet expansion. Is it really just needing stimulus at this point to get the infrastructure piece going? Or is it waiting for a replacement cycle? Or is it an expansion of the rental channel? What's going to get that North America to kind of break out?","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think it's a question that will be discussed at the Analyst Day in September. But I think if you go back to the chart on Construction Industries sales that's in the presentation pack, I think what you'll see is we have seen healthy growth and non-residential and residential spend, although we still think from a residential perspective we're not keeping up with population growth in the U.S. But what has, I'd say, disappointed for the last several years has been a lack of growth in infrastructure investment, which is really, I think, the area that looks prime to need some more investment and some more growth.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Steve.","Amy A. Campbell - Caterpillar, Inc.","And with that, I think that was our last question. Kate?","Operator","Thank you.

Profit per share was a first quarter record of $3.25 rising 19%. This result included a contribution of $0.31 per share of a discrete tax benefit. Consolidated sales and revenues grew 5%. Resource industries led the way, driven by higher demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Growth from Construction Industries was fueled by higher end-user demand for construction equipment and price utilization.","Operating profit rose 5%. We benefited from favorable price realization, volume gains and lower short-term incentive compensation expenses, which more than offset higher manufacturing costs, as well as investments in SG&A and R&D for future growth. Strong operating cash flow of $860 million allowed us to repurchase $750 million in company stock in addition to paying the dividend as part of our continued commitment to shareholder returns. These strong first quarter results are a reflection of stronger demand and the benefit of executing our strategy for profitable growth by investing in services, expanding our offerings and improving operational excellence.","Growing services is a critical element of our strategy. Services allows us to provide additional customer value in a variety of ways, including reducing downtime and maximizing machine availability. Digital is an enabler of this strategy with connectivity at the foundation. Last year we added about 250,000 new connected assets bringing our total to about 850,000 assets connected worldwide.","We look forward to sharing more on how we think about services during our upcoming investor day. Expanding our offerings enables us to grow our business and reflect our commitment to create greater customer value by providing solutions to meet diverse customer needs in different markets around the world. ","Some of our progress was on display earlier this month at Bauma, a Construction Industries largest trade show of the Munich, Germany, every three years. I was proud to walk the floor of the Caterpillar exhibit and engage with our dedicated employees and valued customers. Among the highlights were the next generation hydraulic excavators with new semi autonomous features, which give operators more information and insight than ever before. We also displayed the world's first high drive Electric Drive dozer, the D6XE. It offers up to 35% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor.","We also showcase new hybrid technologies on three Perkins engines as well as five new engines from its range of EU stage five engines designed to meet new emission standards, increase productivity and lower lifecycle costs. To complement these expanded offerings on the stand customers also learned about new services, including aftermarket products, customer service agreements and our new CAT app which allows customers to easily track critical machine operating data from the field.","We continue to focus on enhancing operational excellence, including safety. Our safety goal is always zero incidents. We want all of our employees to return home safely every day. One of the metrics we track at number of recordable injuries for 200,000 hours worked. So far this year, we are tracking 9% better than 2018, and we will not miss focus on his priority to prevent injuries and keep our people safe.","Executing our strategy is allowing us to improve operating profit and free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. During our Investor Day on May 2, we will discuss our expectations for operating margins and free cash flow.","Now turning to the 2019 outlook on Slide 4, we continue to have confidence in the fundamentals of our diverse end markets and expectations for 2019 performance are unchanged. However, we adjusted our range of 1,175 to 1,275 by the amount of the discreet tax benefit we realized in the first quarter. That brings our 2019 outlook to 1206 to 1306 profit per share. We continue to expect modest sales growth and continued cost discipline for full year 2019.","Now let's walk through what we're seeing in the external environment. In Construction Industries, we continue to believe that the healthy U.S. economy, along with stable local funding for infrastructure development will be a positive for us, partly offset by weakness in residential construction. We continue to expect demand to remain low in Latin America this year.","In the Europe, Africa and Middle East region demand remained steady despite the political and economic uncertainties. In Asia-Pacific infrastructure activity remains strong. Within China, we continue to expect our sales to be flat with last year. For resource industries, we continue to expect most commodity prices to remain at investible level. We are seeing mining companies becoming increasingly willing to invest in CapEx. While that is encouraging, mines remain disciplined in CapEx deployment. We expect demand for heavy construction and quarrying in aggregate equipment to remain strong.","In Energy & Transportation, oil prices are recovery, but the volatility in oil prices and take away construction in the Permian are impacting demand for well servicing equipment in the first half of the year. Later in the year, the U.S pipeline constraints are expected to ease, and we anticipate an increase in demand. GAAP compression should remain healthy for demand for power generation equipment continues to be a positive.","Finally in transportation, we expect improvements in our way of business including services.","With that, I will turn the call over to Andrew for a closer look at our financials.","Andrew Bonfield ","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We have reported record first quarter results today as we continue to execute our strategy and use our operating an execution model to drive profitable growth.","I will walk through the results starting with Slide 5 before turning to our updated outlook for the full year. Sales and revenues for the quarter totaled $13.5 billion up 5% from last year, driven by both volume gains and price realization with Resource Industries having a strong first quarter, in particular.","First quarter profit per share of $3.25 included a $0.31 per share discrete tax benefit, increased 19% from the prior year's first quarter. This is driven by higher sales, partly offset by higher manufacturing costs and higher spending on SG&A and R&D due to increased investments versus the first quarter of last year.","Now let's turn to top line on Slide 6. Sales and revenue growth in the quarter was driven by volume gains and price realization, partially offset by currency. Volume gains, primarily reflected strong demand in both Resource Industries and Construction Industries. Resource Industries from demand was due to growth in original equipment and services. For construction industry sales in North America rose double-digits this quarter. Energy & Transportation sales were flat versus the prior year. Currency pressures reflected dollar strengthening, principally primary against euro, the Australian dollar and the Chinese plan.","If you move to Slide 7, I will walk through the changes in operating profit. As shown on the chart, price realization and sales volumes drovethe operating profit increase contributing $292 million and $265 million respectively. Financial Products also added $26 million to operating profits for the quarter.","Manufacturing costs increased by $375 million due to higher material costs, freight and variable labor. These higher costs, while unfavorable, were improved from the fourth quarter levels, material costs included a direct tariff expense in the first quarter of about $70 million in line with what we expected. Remember tariffs only started in July of last year. So these will have an impact in Q1 and Q2 until we're passed their original implementation date. Also while steel prices have moderated, after procurement contracts have a light effect so these are still rising across.","Labor costs are impacted by production bottlenecks as our suppliers continue to ramp up volumes. SG&A and R&D spending increased despite lower levels of short-term incentive compensation expense, primarily due to investments in growth areas including services and expanded offerings, as well as some corporate level items. The competitors are also set against the low-level of spend in Q1 last year. Currency was unfavorable by about $20 million. Restructuring costs were not material for the quarter.","Now, let\u2019s look at the performance of each segment in Q1 beginning with Construction Industries on Slide 8. Sales were $5.9 billion, an increase of $196 million or 3%. Construction sales increased in North America by $345 million due to higher demand for new equipment, particularly for road construction activities. Sales declined in Asia-Pacific, EAME and Latin America. Asia Pacific sales were down 4% or $66 million. Currency was the driver as volumes in China was about flat, which is what we expected. In the EAME, sales declined by 6% or $61 million due to smaller increase in dealer inventories and weaker euro partly offset by favorable price realization.","Lastly macro economic factors in Latin America contributed to a decline in sales 7% or $25 million off of a very low base.","Turning to profit Construction Industries segment profit declined by 3%, the segment profit margin of 18.5% was a decrease of 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2018. The favorable impact of higher price realization is more than offset by higher manufacturing costs. This increase in cost was led by high material labor on freight costs. While these costs increase, the magnitude was less we saw on the fourth quarter and was driven by the same factors are mentioned a moment ago. The backlog for Construction Industries rose as higher production levels supported an increase in orders rates. We continue to have most free line products from managed distribution.","Now let's go to Slide 9, look at Resource Industries. Resource Industries sales were $2.7 billion, up 18% from the first quarter of 2018. The $418 million increase in sales of the quarter reflected high equipment demand, favorable price utilization and increased services. We saw solid demand from mining and heavy construction equipment, including quarry and aggregate. Asia-Pacific was particularly strong with sales up $275 million or about 52%. The backlog declined in Resource Industries as our factories continue to ramp up production, which resulted in increased dealer inventories.","First quarter orders were higher than in Q4 2018. We continue to expect higher money CapEx in 2019, lean us to expect higher sales in new equipment this year.","Segment profit of $576 million, rose 52% versus first quarter of last year. Segment profit margin improved to about 21%, up 470 basis points in 2018. Resource Industries improved performance and margins expansion was primarily due to higher sales volumes. Favorable price realization was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including increased material and fright costs as well as slightly higher warranty expense.","Turning to Slide 10, we will review Energy & Transportation results. Energy & Transportation sales in the first quarter were $5.2 billion comparable to same quarter last year. Favorable price realization and higher sales volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency sheet. Sales into oil and gas applications decreased by $84 million or 7%, primarily due to the timing internal project delivers in North America. Sales in power generation rose by $67 million or 7%, due to higher demand for large diesel reciprocating engine applications.","Industrial sales were similar to last year's first quarter with gained North America more than offset by an increase in the EMEA. Transportation sales decline 2%. We recently marked one-year anniversary of acquisition of two rail service businesses in January 2018.","Segment profit for Energy & Transportation was $838, down $36 million or 4%. The segment profit margin contracted by 60 basis points drove about 16%. Energy & Transportation margins reflect to higher manufacturing costs driven by freight costs and warrantee expense. The increase in backlog in ENG was driven by rail related services and turbines, which will partially offset by specific engines due to softness in oil and gas that Jim referred to earlier. ","Now let's go to Slide 11, and I will walk through our assumptions for the 2019 outlook. Our profit per share outlook range for 2019 is now $12.06 to $13.06. The change from our prior range of $11.75 to $12.75 reflects a discrete tax item mentioned earlier. Our assumptions with the business loss were largely unchanged. We continue to have competence in the fundamental of our diverse end markets and we expect sales to increase modestly this year. We also anticipate the price realization will offset higher manufacturing costs, short-term incentive compensation is expected to be a tailwind of about $500 million. We project restructuring costs of about $100 million to $200 million for the full year. This makes annual tax rate is unchanged at 26% except for the discrete types item we called out.","We see capital expenditures in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Our outlook assumes that the macroeconomic geopolitical environment is largely unchanged.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect to continue the execution of our strategy, including additional investments for long-term profitable growth was appropriate. We anticipate stronger results in the back half of the year, including better variable margins and stronger demand from oil and gas customers in North America.","Depending on markets from based on internal assessment of enterprise in terms of value. We expect to be active in the market and repurchase another $750 million company stock in the second quarter of 2019. Any additional share repurchases will depend upon cash generation and alignment with our capital allocation priorities. We do not expect to make any additional voluntary pension contributions due to the $1 billion description pension contribution we made in the third quarter of last year.","So finally let\u2019s turn to Slide 12 and recap today\u2019s results. It was a record first quarter of profit per share following the record first quarter last year. We have updated our guidance to $12.06 to $13.06 in profit per share. Given that strong financial profile we were able to return $1.2 billion to shareholders from the quarter, while executing our strategy and investing for long term profitable growth.","With that, I will hand it back to cater operator to begin the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question today is coming from Jerry Revich at Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.","Jerry Revich","In resources, I'm wondering if you could update us on your expectations on when large project prospects are expected to turn into orders over the past year we\u2019ve seen CapEx budgets and truck utilization moving the right direction. And I'm wondering what do you expect that to translate to backlog growth for your resource business?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, Jerry, it\u2019s Jim. I\u2019ll take that one on. So we\u2019re seeing healthy levels of business from our mining customers. As you know we had some issues in terms of ramping up production particularly with our suppliers over the last few months. And our backlog chain really is a reflection of the fact that we\u2019ve been able to ramp up production as oppose to any softening of demand. So again the market is strong. We expect to continue to have good market activity here and we\u2019re ramping up production, which has resulted in a reduction in our backlog.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then I'm wondering if you could just expand on your dealer inventory comments. So healthy dealer inventory build in the first quarter you mentioned resource is still at low levels of dealer inventories and you\u2019re looking for food business to be up low single due to organically. This year is the flat dealer inventory comment really an expectation or is that a place holder as we see activity ramp up in other words. It sounds like you either expect to reduce production over the course of the year or retail sales to accelerate if we do indeed see flat dealer inventories year end 19 versus year end 18?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, so Jerry, obviously, keep in mind that dealers own and control the inventories so our expectations are based on what we expect their order levels to be. Obviously, we did see an increase in inventory levels in the first quarter for the usual seasonal regions. Obviously, we\u2019re making sure that we work closely with our dealers to make sure we align their inventory with current market demands. We believe that is about appropriate. And we believe actually flat at the end of the year is a reasonable assumption to be making at this stage.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook at Credit Suisse. Your line is live.","Jamie Cook","First question just on the resource margin, very much higher than expectation, I know volume and price helped, but was there any benefit there from sort of restructuring or mix and given the shrink in the first quarter, how do we think about sort of full year margin? And then just a follow up question on the dealer inventory level, can you comment on dealer inventory levels? Your months of dealer inventory level either by region or product? Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","Hi Jamie, it's Jim. As you know we don\u2019t guide -- we don\u2019t give segment margin guidance, but yes first quarter margins are quite strong. A lot of that was driven by volume leverage. We had good price as well, and also just looking at the timing of investment that we had throughout the year was relatively low in the first quarter.","Andrew Bonfield","And with regards to dealer inventories, generally, obviously, we try to keep dealer inventories to the sort of three to four month level is sort of target guide range, and we try to do that across everywhere and across all product groups. It would be our biggest guide. Obviously, in some areas as we know and see how we are on them distribution. So obviously some inventory levels are lower and could rise higher over time once we get those products off managed distribution.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Rob Wertheimer at Melius Research. Your line is live.","Rob Wertheimer","If you look at your market share in China construction over the last 10 years, I think you're more or less doubled it if you use a tonnage basis as opposed to units. You do well in the bigger machines and you've done well in growing that category. Could you sort of talk about what's driven that and then what's changed in the last three, four months to cause some ebbing of those changes?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes, so China, obviously, this year we saw relatively flat first quarter sales in China, which is consistent, obviously, with prior year. Spring season, as you know, is usually a strong selling season in China, and goes stronger than normal across the whole of the sector mainly due to the timing of Chinese New Year, but there's also been some very competitive pricing. And that has had some impact on those market shares. We now expect the industry -- our expectation for the industry for the full year is China to be up. We expect our sales to be flattish for the year. So we will lose some market share in Q1, but we're taking actions to gain it back, working with dealers and also launching new models, which is the key part of the strategy, which we think is the right strategy that enables us to compete.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan at JP Morgan Securities. Your line is live.","Ann Duignan","I was just wondering if you could give us an update on your 1% to 4% price increase targets across your different segments and regions.","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So Ann, as you saw that for the full year or for the full first quarter, we had saw price of about $292 million. That\u2019s about 2% on net revenues, obviously, that was stronger in CI and RI than it was in ENT. That effect is basically partly some impact because of the midyear price increase, which is mostly in Construction Industries last year. And then, obviously, the price increase, which was more broadly brushed across the whole segments on the six segments on 1st January. We expect Q1 and Q2 to have better price realization, but once we get pass the anniversary of the midyear price increase CI in particular, will be less price realized in second half of the year. But so far we're holding good level of the prices increases we put through.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And then in that context, just one quick follow up on the CI. Were you comparable with your incremental margins even though they weren\u2019t incremental? Or did anything specific happen in Q1's cost Construction Industries margins to be worst that you might have expected and how should we think about those margins going forward? Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","Yes. So I\u2019ll talk about comparables again just rather than I see because we don\u2019t give a detailed guidance for that individual segment. But if you look at the comparables to CI, we are, I think, we\u2019re seeing some material price increases both steel and tariffs had an impact as we talked about more broadly. They particularly impacted CI. Freight costs just authorized indeed towards the end of the -- in the middle of second quarter last year. So we\u2019re still ramping past those. Obviously, as we get pass those comparable increases, our margins should stabilize and be better for the remainder of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steven Fisher at UBS Securities. Your line is live.","Steven Fisher","Just curious how you are thinking about the guidance for the year and the visibility for the second half, in general? Obviously, you hit your Q1 buyback plan still have plenty of cash to do more buybacks. I think you mentioned another similar quarter buybacks in the second quarter. So do you think the guidance is conservative given that you don\u2019t have a lot more buyback in guidance and maybe clarify that next 750 is in guidance? Or is there something about the visibility in the second half of the year, whereby it\u2019s making you cautious you might need the buybacks as an offset?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, I think, on this point of year in terms of our guidance for our profitability, it\u2019s early in the year so we're maintaining our range. In terms of buybacks, one of the things we\u2019re going to discuss a bit next week at our Investor Day is our financial capital deployment. So we look forward to see you there having that conversation.","Steven Fisher","Okay. But just to clarify, is the $750 million for Q2, I think, you said is that now baked into guidance?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, that guidance assumes that we have a consistent level of buyback activity quarter-on-quarter.","Steven Fisher","And then just a follow up on the North American construction business, you said a higher demand on road building. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing outside of road construction and what do you think about the mix later in the year?","Jim Umpleby","Well, again, we talked about the fact that we have strong infrastructures, and local and state infrastructure investment is helping drive sales of residential was a bit soft. We don\u2019t see -- we don\u2019t expect a major mix change for the remainder of the year.","Steven Fisher","Anything on the commercial side?","Jim Umpleby","There is nothing to add.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso at Evercore ISI Institutional Equity. Sir your line is live.","David Raso","If I look at your implied sales guidance for the rest of the year, and I utilize your historical sequential changes in your backlog, it would imply that year-over-year backlog does stay down year-over-year for most of the year and maybe back to flat in the fourth quarter. But that also does imply your orders term positive year-over-year in the third quarter and for the full second half. Is that what you\u2019re hearing from your customers and dealers that we should be seeing the orders growing year-over-year in the second half of the 2019?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes, David, I mean there are couple of things, one which is, obviously, mining CapEx is one area where, obviously, we're expecting the order rate to continue to accelerate the year, particularly given we are to expect an increase from mining CapEx for the full year. And as replacement cycle starts to move ahead, obviously, that will help us on from a backlog perspective. In ENC, as we've indicated, well, we do expect to see some order improvement in second half of the year is around oil and gas, reciprocating engines, in particularly as the Permian Takeaway issues are started to moderate. So those are probably the two big factors, which we would say would drive orders from second half of the year.","David Raso","And that sort there will be an aggregate drive in the total company orders albeit year-over-year, I guess, a key question that what you're seeing and obviously thinking about in your guidance. Is that what the numbers imply?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, that is what we're thinking and our guidance implies.","David Raso","And in that same regard, if orders were up in the second half of the year, price cost, the way you're guiding here that would imply the first quarter was the worst of the price cost for the full year. Can we extrapolate that into your thoughts on margins year-over-year in aggregate for second half?","Jim Umpleby","Sorry, David, can I just clarify price\/cost? You mean price realization?","David Raso","Price, as in the waterfall chart, yes, price versus the manufacturing costs in this quarter was fair down 83 million negative, which actually worse than we saw at any quarter last year. I\u2019m just making sure that where you laying it out, does that then set of the margins year-over-year go back to growing.","Jim Umpleby","Yes, well basically as we've also said and guidance assumes this price offset material cost increases or manufacturing cost increases for the full year. So yes, that would imply an improvement from that part of the factor of the remainder of the year?","David Raso","My last quick one. This might be my second question I apologize. But when you think about cash flow and use of it, that's fine, but even on the balance sheet, the amount of cash you are caring, you can define it as you wish, cash to total debt, cash to shareholder equity, cash to total assets, everyone, the cash on the equipment company seems very high. So when I hear share report number 750, which isn\u2019t even pushing the cash flow usage. Can you help us understand specially as a new CFO to the company, Andrew, what do you think the appropriate cash level should be for the equipment company?","Andrew Bonfield","I assume we will talk about that in May 2 Day.","David Raso","Yes. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","And as a reminder could we have please one question per caller. Thanks ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Gilardi at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is live.","Ross Gilardi","Jim, I\u2019m just wondering across your overall portfolio what are you hearing from your biggest customers with respect to trade war into the field, in general, like there's pent-up demand for capital spending projects around the world in the next year if this whole thing is resolved?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, I think, most of our large customers are as we are cautiously optimistic that we will work our way through this trade issues. Certainly, anytime there are trade tensions of this kind. It does put a certain amount of conservatism, I think, into all of our plans for capital spending. So I would expect this in fact the trade tension get resolved, that would be a positive for global economic growth and positive for us.","Ross Gilardi","And just on the order trends, I mean, you had originally obviously guided in January and some of the macro data feels a little bit better more recently. Did you see any type of reacceleration in order trends? Would you say as the quarter unfolded and as commodity prices recovered or you could say kind of more March, April today versus January and February?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, certainly. As you know we\u2019re a very diverse business so just talk about some of the areas. In oil and gas reset, much has been written about the fact that there\u2019s constraints in the Permian and that did have a bit of a negative impact on order rates for our reciprocated engines sold into oil and gas. As you mentioned earlier, mine activity both in the aftermarket and for new equipment, that quotation activity is quite strong, obviously, again, miners are being cautious based on what the cycle of the past. But generally we feel good about our business, and we feel good about the quotation activity in the segment we\u2019re getting from our customers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Noah Kay at Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is live.","Noah Kay","Just on your comments on CapEx budgets, I think the company previously guided for CapEx to be about flat year-over-year. The guidance you provided in the slide to just immediate increases of about 10% at the midpoint? Is there anything in particular which you think about driving that or you having to ramp up your production infrastructure and maybe together segment?","Jim Umpleby","No. I can\u2019t -- generally, I would say CapEx is still below book depreciation reminds me that that is a positive from a cash flow perspective. And we are expecting it to be flattish, I think, last year it was about 1.3, so the bottom end of that range. There\u2019s no significant big build up of incremental production and required.","Andrew Bonfield","Kate, are you there?","Unidentified Company Representative ","Jim had a question for you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey at Well Fargo Securities. Your line is live.","Andrew Casey","I'm trying to understand the comments about manufacturing costs gone down a little bit in Q1 versus Q4, and then the back half improvement. And juxtaposing against last year it is seasonally a typical period where margins decline in Q2 from Q1. You might have answered it, but I'm still little unclear. Should we expect Q2 manufacturing margin to be higher than Q1 and then further improvement in the second half?","Jim Umpleby","No. What it will be is, compared to the comps for the last year, if you look Q1, obviously, this year margin was lower as a result of the seal tariff and freight costs. We expect those to moderate as we go through, not there\u2019ll be similar impact on Q2 because, obviously, those increases won't be fully in effect for most of the Q2 last year, and then obviously will moderate in the second half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joe O\u2019Dea at Vertical Research Partners. Your line is live.","Joe O\u2019Dea","A related question on manufacturing costs, and just I think you've talked to the tariffs related costs. If you could break that 375 down at all anymore, it doesn't sound like there are any mitigating actions in process to take that down. It's more about a wait and see and then comps get easier. But I just wanted to understand if there some opportunities for you to address those whether that's rerouting supplies whether that's any other kind opportunities you have. But just given if that was a pretty substantial headwind in the quarter, what kind of medication we could see?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So there are two areas where we do expect some mitigation, probably later this year, one which is around steel prices, just purely because we lag behind because of the effect of, as I said, our procurement practices. And as you look, currently, obviously, with the Vale issues or product prices all looking at slightly higher, but there should be some benefit of slightly lower steel price coming through later this year. And that\u2019s one of the areas where we are going to obviously be looking for some potential cost savings. The other area, which is also issues around variable liable burden, which basically is really around the fact that obviously as we building our production, we're having some bottlenecks. So as a result of supplier issues, and we expect those to mitigate during the rest of the year as well. So we do expect some of these not just we mitigated by the comp period, but also by actual actions we are taking.","Joe O\u2019Dea","And then also on lag effects and related to the pricing, I mean, when we think about midyear 18, we implemented some price increases and then again on Jan 1, presumably 1Q doesn\u2019t fully reflect at least what happened on Jan 1, because of some things that might've already been in backlog. But could you just talk about the degree to which there is still some lag effective seeing those price actions that were implemented?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes, we do expect the second half of price realization to be lower than the first half because of the midyear price increase last year. That was the -- that is one of the biggest factors in the -- in above the 2% rise is obviously that's fully baked in enterprising now. So we would expect second half to be lower. And as I said we had guided to have basically price offset manufacturing cost increases.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber at RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live.","Seth Weber ","I guess first just a clarification on Jim, your comment that the orders were up in the first quarters versus the fourth quarter. Is that -- does that include traditional mining equipment? Or is that more skewed towards quarrying or big construction?","Jim Umpleby","Yes, I think what I said was our order activity remains strong in our eyes. So hopefully, I gave a quarter-to-quarter comparison. But again, quotation activity is strong. And the general quotation activity and order activity is healthy.","Andrew Bonfield","Yes, I think from an overall prospective actually it was my comment, I think, I did say actually order rate in Q4 was higher -- Q1 was higher than Q4 2018. So we did see that increase -- some increase coming through. That was in mining, and there was some -- it was still strong though in Korean ag at the moment.","Seth Weber","And then my question is really just on RI again, it sounds like a lot of the sales today are really on the OE side. I mean would you expect the mix to tilt more towards parts and service as you get as equipment usage starts picking up more. So I guess I'm just wondering could mix become more favorable later in the year or even next year? Thanks.","Jim Umpleby","We didn't mean to give the impression that it's skewed towards O&E at this point, so both are quite healthy at the moment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann at Jeffries & Company. Your line is live.","Stephen Volkmann","Most of its been answered, but I think there was some commentary about SG&A spending being a little bit elevated due to some growth initiatives. And I'm curious if there\u2019s any detail you can give around that. And then does that sort of fade also in the second half as well?","Jim Umpleby","We continue to make investments -- targeted investments for long term profitable growth in the area of services and in expanded offerings. In services, we continue to connect more assets. We\u2019re more investing in our digital platform. We\u2019re investing in our analytics. And we continue to develop expanded product offerings as well to ensure that we have the right product offerings and right price point for different markets around the world. So again, we\u2019re in this for the long haul, obviously, and we\u2019re making those targeted investments to grow services and expanded offerings.","Andrew Bonfield","And the run rate was slightly higher than you would normally -- remember, you got the short-term incentive compensation credit coming through this year and SG&A. So some of that was also there was some corporate one-time items relating to some compensation items in retail at the corporate level. And there were also, obviously, as Jim said, there\u2019s investments that we\u2019ve made in the business itself which helped very well. We also had very low comps last year for SG&A and R&D in the first quarter of last year. We had a very low slow ramp up of spend.","Stephen Volkmann","And looking forward is it sort of steady or is this burn half loaded?","Andrew Bonfield","I mean the first quarter is one of the highest levels of SG&A spend from an increase perspective through the reminder of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Adam Colman at Cleaveland Research Company. Your line is live.","Adam Colman","I was wondering if you could talk about the order trends that you\u2019re seeing across the power churn business that was the one area of sales growth within E&T this quarter, but the retail sales have slowed here almost to flat. So I was wondering if you could talk about what you\u2019re seeing by geography and product line and the order book for that chunk of the business?","Jim Umpleby","We had seen a recovery in Powergen over the last few months in that and we expect that to continue. It is an area of strength for us. Obviously, that business is a cocoon and we had a bit of a downturn previously that we\u2019re now recovering from. But can we expect that business to continue to be healthy.","Adam Colman","And then related to that, in E&T, you had mentioned earlier that you expect your order trends across oil and gas for resent entrants improve in the second half. Have you seen any of that improvement yet so far or that\u2019s still on the comment?","Jim Umpleby","Again gas compression is remained strong and steady. We haven\u2019t seen a pickup in order rates for well servicing and the reset portion of oil and gas yet. But again, we expect that to come. Another part of our oil and gas business is, of course, Solar Turbines, and that business has remained steady. We\u2019re seeing a pickup there in international orders, which are typically tied more to the big CapEx projects, and there will be oil prices. So that business is starting pick up.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is from Larry De Maria at William Blaire. Your line is live. ","Larry De Maria","First question, can you just provide the full year incentive comp benefit? And then secondly just a broader question, I have is around, CI dealer manage distribution. I'm just curious how much is being restrained? And when should we think about that getting maybe more in balance perhaps after the spring selling season when things come down. But how restrained is that? And when do that get more imbalanced? How do we think about that? Thank you.","Jim Umpleby","So the first question on incentive comp, we expect about $500 million benefit there this year compared to last year. And in terms of manage distribution for CI, again, it's obviously dynamic situation based on how we ramp up supply and what's happen into the market place. I don\u2019t anticipate a major change here over the next few months in that situation.","Larry De Maria","Okay. Based on the CI orders, probably shouldn\u2019t get more out of whack than already is now. We may get more towards, more equilibrium situation, maybe later in this year. Is that fair?","Jim Umpleby","Yes. We expected to be broadly flattish for the reminder of the year, yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chad Dillard at Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is live. ","Chad Dillard ","So I want to dig into the price realization seen in Resource Industries in the past quarter. Just want to understand how broad-based it was? And to the extend, it was driven by mix. And how should I think about that and how sustainable those on a go forward basis?","Jim Umpleby","Yes. I mean, price utilization, again, was very strong in RI in Q1, and we do expect it to be the highest quarter for the year. So yes, I mean, it was little bit. There is a little bit of an element mix in that number wish to come through. So yes.","Andrew Bonfield","Right, because it\u2019s a project based business and quite lumpy. You will see certain metrics jump around quarter-to-quarter. It's just the nature of the beast for show off for rail and for RI.","Chad Dillard","Got it. And then just a question on Cat Financial. It seems like there is a little bit of uptick on credit loss allowances. Just hoping to get a little bit additional color on that that\u2019s driving either from regional perspective or end markets?","Jim Umpleby","So, I mean, in Cat Financial, the actual past views actually were up from 3.55% in Q4 to 3.61% in Q1. So very small increase, obviously, a bigger increase year-over-year that mostly reflects the Cat Financial portfolio, which we talked about in Q4, which obviously has had an impact on the quality of the overall past views. You also, probably are seeing that we had a mark to market gain in Cat Financial this quarter. Remember in the last quarter we had a loss -- mark to market loss on that and this effectively is just an offset quarter-on-quarter.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Courtney Yakavonis at Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.","Courtney Yakavonis","Andrew, I think you outlined a little bit about how we should be affecting medication in steel prices and from the variable labor in the back half of the year in addition to lapping over there the entire costs from last year. Can you just comment a little bit on freight costs and whether we\u2019ve obviously seen stock rates drop, but whether we should see that mitigate in the back half as well? And maybe just talk a little bit about how your freight costs are contracting out?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes, so obviously there were two factors driving freight costs, one which is actually cost itself, which did rise, probably mostly from the second quarter last year. So again, we should get past that on a comparable basis sometimes in second half of the year. The other factor which was a big issue for us last year and it becoming less of an issue is around backlog of orders. So as we have past few orders that we need to fill, we have had some freight inefficiencies, and again we\u2019re working to make sure we mitigate those as best as we can going forward.","Courtney Yakavonis","And then just quickly, one other clarification, I think you had mentioned in oil and gas some of the weakness is due to some timing of turbine product deliveries just want to understand how that should impact the back half of this year, especially given that you\u2019re expecting gas compression or still kind of up this quarter. So just trying to understand and expect that acceleration in the back half to come and take away shoes just all the moves and takes in the oil and gas segment.","Jim Umpleby","Yes. I would look at those separately. I try to separate it your mind reset versus turbines, so again turbine business is very lumpy so that you can revenue rack one large project in a quarter and it has a very big impact and you don't have that large project and also there is a decline. So again, our Solar Turbines business is solid and we expect a good year. On the research, and as I mentioned earlier, we have seen again oil and gas compression strong we saw a bit of the slowdown in the order intake in well servicing, and we expect that to recover later in the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Neil Frohnapple at Buckingham Research. Your line is live.","Neil Frohnapple","Within CI, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing from a used-equipment price standpoint? Are you seeing weakness creeping at all for any of the major equipment categories like to be concern as you look out?","Jim Umpleby","I mean, Neil, that we found the well. There was one auction done in Orlando where there was weakness in prices from, but generally, aside from that is actually been flattish. So used-price equipment seems to be holding up reasonably well above from that one particular.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks. And Kate, I believe we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Mig Dobre at Robert W. Baird. Your line is live.","Mig Dobre","So going back to resources, I don\u2019t want to put what the amount here, but to me it sounds like you\u2019re more positive this quarter than you had been, say in the fourth quarter at the back half of 2018 in terms of your commentary and kind of how you\u2019re talking about demand going forward. I want to make sure that I get that message properly here and maybe have you expand this to kind of what\u2019s driving this incremental positivity? And related to that as replacement demand is starting to come through from some of your customers eventually, do you feel that the industry has the right amount of capacity available to serve there?","Jim Umpleby","Yes. So again, I mean, we feel good about just to say the business, our quotation activity is good, the aftermarket activity is good. We have certain terms of thinking about parked equipment and that has certainly come down. And so I won't be so presumptuous as to make thinking about how our customers are positioned, but we believe based on all our conversations, we expect this recovery to continue. And obviously, there is timing issues and let's make a judgment call is to what you think will happen this year, what you think will happen next year, but generally we feel positive about RI business and the activity that we're seeing.","Mig Dobre","And from a capacity standpoint?","Jim Umpleby","It's very -- its situational right. So it's geographic and it's also depends on the kind of commodity that is being mined. In certain areas there still a bit of excess capacity, in other areas there is not. And so really it's a mix bag, we can't really give one answer to that question.","Andrew Bonfield","We're still significantly below levels, which we saw in the previous peak. So we believe we've sufficient capacity to meet most of demand.","Mig Dobre","Right. It is just that has been a lot of restructuring that\u2019s been done in the downturn as well, which is why I was asking. And then one last question on E&T pricing, obviously, little weaker versus the rest of the company, and I'm wondering is there any perspective you can provide on various businesses in that segment where there might be some pricing deviation from the average reported either positive or negative? Thanks.","Jim Umpleby","I mean, I think, generally, obviously the pricing actions that occurred in E&T probably as a higher mix of services as well. Some model of that would spread through the price increase. So that would be a significant factor. There's obviously machines, particularly in parts, in particular for CI and RI were more broadly base.","Jennifer Driscoll","Jim, turn it back to you for some closing comments.","Jim Umpleby","Sure. Well thanks everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your questions. We're pleased with our team's performance, including another record first quarter for profit per share.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open up the floor for your questions and comments folloing the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Mike DeWalt","Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to Caterpillar\u2019s year-end 2011 earnings call. I am Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations. I am pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and our Group President and CFO, Ed Rapp, with us on the call today.","This call is copyright by Caterpillar Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of this call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you would like a copy of today\u2019s call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investor section of our caterpillar.com website and it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","This morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make actual results differ materially from our projections, can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22 of 2011 and also in our forward-looking statements language contained in today\u2019s release.","Okay. Earlier this morning, we were very pleased to report fourth quarter results that capped off a record breaking year in 2011. To start this morning, I\u2019ll cover the headlines.","For the fourth quarter, sales and revenues were $17.2 billion, the highest quarter in our history and profit was $2.32 a share also an all-time record for any quarter in company history. And, it was a record for sales and profit whether or not you include Bucyrus.","For the full year, sales were about $60 billion and profit was $7.40 a share. The year was also a record topping the previous record of 2008, which was $51 billion at the top line and profit for share of $5.66.","The other big headline this morning was the outlook for 2012, and we have raised our guidance for sales and revenues to a range of $68 billion to $72 billion with a midpoint of $70 billion. That midpoint is up about $3 billion from the midpoint of the preliminary outlook for 2012 that we provided with our third quarter financial release last October. Now those were the three big headlines of the day, the quarter, the full year and the outlook.","Now, I would like to just take a few minutes and go through some of our noteworthy accomplishments in 2011, then we\u2019ll cover the high points of our 2012 outlook and will finish the call by taking your questions.","2011 was a great for Cat, probably the most positive in the 30 plus years of my career here. While the financial results in and of themselves were outstanding, we had a great year in a number of areas that along with the better industry growth that we saw was a foundation of our financial success this year.","The first area of highlighted acquisitions and in terms of executing our strategy, it was a pretty high profile item. Over the past year and a half we made three large ones, Bucyrus, EMD and MWM. Integrating them into Cat has been a high priority for us and a big focus in 2011 and while there is still much to do, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress so far.","In terms of Cat operations, our success this year had much to do with the discipline of a Cat production system, its becoming a way of life at Caterpillar and its been the foundation that drove improvements in safety, quality, velocity and efficiency in 2011.","The safety of our workforce, contractors and visitors is fundamental to our values and we\u2019re pleased that our enterprise safety improved again in 2011 and are now 83% better than 2003.","Quality, it\u2019s a big reason why customers buy Cat equipment. It\u2019s critical to the Cat business model and it\u2019s another benefit that we\u2019ve seen from the Cat production system. It has been a big focus for us and I\u2019m pleased to report that in 2011, we continued another year of better product reliability for our customers.","Given the sizeable increase in demand we experienced in 2011, we stretch our factories and our suppliers to produce more. The results were outstanding and we were able to significantly increase production and do it while we improve the quality. In fact, we would like to take this opportunity right now to say thank you to our suppliers. With their help in 2011, this was the highest year-over-year increase in sales in our history and on a percentage basis; it was the most significant year-over-year increase since 1947.","Now, in addition to our investment and acquisitions, we invested significantly in organic growth. For many products demand has above our ability to produce, we have invested in Caterpillar factories in the United States and around the world to increase production. Despite those increases and continuing investment in 2012, where we are expecting CapEx to be up about 50% and near $4 billion, we\u2019re still very tight on many products and are currently quoted extended delivery times for some of them.","As an example, for many models of large trucks, we are now quoting delivery times into 2014. In 2011, we started significant product introductions for Tier 4 in the United States and for similar new omissions requirement in Europe. It\u2019s the most extensive new product introduction program in our history and it went well in 2011 and feedback from dealers and customers on the new product has been very positive.","Another important part of the Cat business model is customer support and the availability of after market parts is one of the key ways to do that. We are pleased to report that in 2011, we made notable improvements in parts availability to raise the bar on product support for customers.","We also improved our competitive position in 2011, while it was a year of growth from the industries we serve, it was an even better year for Cat. In the aggregate and for most of our products, sales increased at a faster rate than the overall industries we serve. Better quality, the delivery performance, our investments and capacity, the performance of our suppliers coupled with modest price increases all helped drive better value for customers and a better competitive position for Caterpillar.","To sum up 2011, record profit, record sales, the most significant percentage increase in sales when Harry Truman was President. The addition of two important strategic in acquisitions, better quality, a good start with Tier 4, good profit leverage on the increase in sales, record operating cash flow, an increase to the dividend and a strong balance sheet, that\u2019s 2011 in that show.","With that let\u2019s turn to the 2012 outlook. For 2012, we\u2019re expecting another record year with sales and revenues in a range of $68 billion to $72 billion and profit of about $9.25 at the midpoint of that sales range.","Overall, we believe the prospects for global growth have improved since we released our preliminary sales outlook last October. We\u2019re forecasting the world economy to grow at about 3.3% in 2012, a small improvement from 2011. In the United States, we expect the Federal Reserve will maintain the funds rate below 25 basis points throughout 2012. And recent economic data suggest that growth improved in the fourth quarter of 2011, which we believe reflects the positive impact of the Fed\u2019s easing that initiated in late 2010. And, it\u2019s our view that the full impact of those actions hasn\u2019t materialized yet and that they\u2019ll contribute to continue growth in 2012.","Our outlook assumes economic growth in the United States of at least 3%. We expect total US construction spending, which has depressed for years to finally begin to show some improvement in 2012. We\u2019re forecasting small improvements in infrastructure related and non-residential construction and our forecast for housing starts is around 700,000 units in 2012 and that\u2019s up from about 600,000 in 2011.","While we expect the small improvements in US construction spending, remember it\u2019s still depressed. Housing starts at 700,000 is still very low and there is no long term broad or infrastructure spending plan that\u2019s been improved in Washington yet.","In the Euro zone, the public debt crisis has been a lingering negative, but we don\u2019t expect it to trigger a worldwide recession. The Euro zone will likely have at least two quarters of weak and possibly negative growth, but we think it will begin to improve in the second half of the year.","We expect the Japanese economy to grow at about 3.5% in 2012 recovering from their 2011 recession. We think that rebuilding from the tsunami and more expansionary central bank policies will help drive their improvement.","We expect economic growth in Asia Pacific above 6.5% in 2012 about the same as in 2011. In China, our forecast is for economic growth of about 8.5%. China took its first easing action in late 2011 and we expect that further easing will continue in 2012.","Growth in Latin America is expected to slow from about 4.3% in 2011 to up 4% in 2012. And then, Africa Middle East were forecasting growth of nearly 5.5% and over 5% in the CIS. Overall, we expect that the world\u2019s economic growth will be enough to drive some higher demand for commodities and support commodity prices that continue at levels to encourage investment.","In terms of Caterpillar sales, we expect increases in 2012 in all four of our geographic regions and for almost all the industries we serve. We\u2019re starting the year with a strong order backlog that\u2019s almost $30 billion and up 37% from the end of 2010 and that\u2019s on an apples-to-apples basis excluding our Bucyrus acquisition.","In 2012, we\u2019ll have a full year of sales related to our Bucyrus and MWM acquisitions and sales for those two are expected to be about $6 billion and that\u2019s an increase from $2.6 billion in 2011 which was a partial for both at Cat. We expect mining to continue to grow globally and we have a strong order backlog for mining equipment. We expect mining sales to increase in 2012 and are in the process of adding additional capacity for many of our products. However, we do expect mining related sales to be constrained by capacity in 2012.","We anticipate the sales of new machines for construction in the developed countries will improve as customers continue rebuild fleets during 2012 and that historically high fleet age and low fleet inventories will cause dealers to continue to upgrade world fleets.","Despite the economic trouble in the Euro zone, all European dealers increased orders over the past few months compared with 2010. Considering the relatively weak sales level there over the past few years and the need for customers to replace machines, we\u2019re expecting machine sales in Europe to be half or above the 2011 levels despite the economic climate in Europe.","Government policy easing in China, which has already started is expected to continue and lead to some recovery machine sales in 2011. We\u2019re forecasting higher sales for our power systems and segment in most industries. High oil prices should encourage investment and improve demand for engines and turbines used in oil and gas application, we also expect improvement in engine sales for electric power generation and higher sales in our rail business. The only area of our power systems business that hasn\u2019t started to recover yet is marine engines.","Coming to profit, at the midpoint of our sales and revenues outlook, we expect profit to increase from $7.40 in 2011 to $9.25 in 2012 and that\u2019s a 25% increase. Bucyrus should move from being a negative to profit in 2011 and that was a result of the deal related to integration cost to being a positive contributor in 2012. While there are certainly headwinds and tailwinds as we move from 2011 to 2012 operationally, on balance we\u2019re expecting that excluding the impacts of MWM and Bucyrus, there are incremental operating profit pull through on incremental sales should be similar to 2011.","The most significant headwind we\u2019re expecting next year or this year in 2012 was tax expense. In 2011, taxes were 25.6 above the full tax profit. And that was the combination of an overall rate of about 27% last discrete favorable tax items during the year. In 2012, we\u2019re forecasting a range of about 30% and taxes are up for three main reasons. Negative geographic mix from a tax perspective, absence of the favorable discrete items that we had in 2011 and the end of the R&D tax credit in the United States.","Two final points before we move to the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. And the first is the bold gold (ph) that we introduced back in August of 2009 and that was at sales and revenues would approach $60 billion and profit per share would be $8 to $10 in 2012. Well, we hit that 2012 sales and revenues target in 2011 a year early.","And even excluding Bucyrus, MWM and EMD, we would be at about $56 billion this year, however, we did not hit that $8 to $10 profit range. We\u2019ve had a number of questions from investors on what\u2019s different now versus what we were assuming in that 2012 target. And we\u2019ve summarized in a somewhat lengthy Q&A in this morning\u2019s press release and that starts page 24.","But, in a nutshell what it says is that if you start with our 2011 actual profit of $7.40 a share, and you adjust it for acquisitions in our share count and our share count is higher because we invested in three large acquisitions rather than buying back shares. If you adjust from fully incentive compensation that was well above target in 2011 because of our excellent results, if you adjust for currency impacts and taxes, you exclude those items we\u2019d have been near the middle of that $8 to $10 profit range on sales and revenues of about $56 billion. And again, I would encourage you to take a look at the Q&A in this morning\u2019s release.","My final point today is on employment. Our global workforce continued to increase in 2011 and we hired. We were up over 14,000 at year end 2011 versus 2010 and that excludes acquisitions and we end up more than 33,000 since year end 2009. 2011 was a great year, the outlook for 2012 have improved and as you might expect, we\u2019re eager to talk to you more about it.","So, with that we\u2019re ready to take questions.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) thank you. Our first question today is coming from Anne Diamond, please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Anne Diamond \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi, good morning, its JP Morgan.","Mike DeWalt","Good morning, Anne.","Anne Diamond \u2013 JP Morgan","My first question would be on Bucyrus orders, it sounds slightly, sequentially $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion, maybe you could just take a step and tell us what\u2019s going on fundamentally Bucyrus customers, is there any risk that slowdown in demand from US thermal coil or just some color on what\u2019s going on there or it\u2019s a 0.1 of a billion just noise?","Mike DeWalt","Well, here is the deal Anne, for Bucyrus actually if you look from third to fourth quarter, the order rate went up quite nicely at Bucyrus. That said, they just had a fantastic fourth quarter in terms of shipments and the shipments were well above what we expect. So, orders are actually up sequentially, pretty nicely, it\u2019s just that they really, clearly did a great job in shipping in the fourth quarter. So, that 0.1 decline in the backlog I think had more to do with how good a job they did in the fourth quarter shipping rather any change in order rate. That said, our view of mining is quite bullish, the comments that I made and kind of the preamble there, this is not specifically Bucyrus, but we\u2019ve got to add more capacity, we\u2019re going to be constrained this year. I mean, on some of those big trucks for example. We\u2019re quoting delivery times now out in 2014. So, now mining is good.","Anne Diamond \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. On that note, just sticking with Bucyrus, you announced the sale of some distribution businesses to Finning. Can you help us in any way shape or form in terms of how we should think about that for our 2012 and go-forward model, how much more is there to do post Finning, what do you think the impact would be on EBIT, anything you can do to help us from a modeling perspective, we would appreciate it?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, no, I understand that. That\u2019s been a very calming question and I do admit we\u2019ve not been able to be overly helpful on that. Here is what I would tell you, we actually closed one of the dealers, the sales of distribution businesses to the dealers in the fourth quarter and there are many, there are in various stages of being in profit today. Your comment about Finning has been announced, others, we\u2019re talking with the dealers, we\u2019re trying to get sorted and done, but of course, aren\u2019t done yet. That will happen throughout the year just because of the sheared number of them. We\u2019re talking about involving more than 50 dealers here. We\u2019re probably not going to be done this year, we\u2019re trying really hard and we hope to get most of the big ones done this year. That impact of the whole deal on our profit, overall, we don\u2019t think it will be very significant this year one way or the other. Part of that has to do with the timing of when they\u2019re getting done. There is also a potential gain or loss impact, which we don\u2019t think will be big during the year, the impact of transactions themselves.","Our intangible amortization is going to go down some as we stall them because the dealers are acquiring some of the intangibles. So, it\u2019s a little bit of a moving target, but at this point it doesn\u2019t look like it will be very significant to 2012. and then, remember as we do this we\u2019ll bringing cash in 2012.","Anne Diamond \u2013 JP Morgan","That\u2019s fair. Just a very final point of clarification in that. Is it only the surface after market that will get sold or might there be some underground asset \u2013?","Mike DeWalt","Everything, the intent is everything, above ground, below ground.","Anne Diamond \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you, I\u2019ll get back in line.","Mike DeWalt","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Joel Tiss. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group","With Buckingham Research. I\u2019m surprised; I\u2019m usually the last one or not even on there. Just two questions, I noticed in the commentary on your press release, you broke down some of the sources of that $12.5 billion revenue growth, inventory, Bucyrus some of the other acquisitions. I wondered if you could give us a little bit of a sense on the operating profit side, you did say that MWM and Bucyrus didn\u2019t contribute much on operating profit, but how about the currency impact and also the inventory build?","Doug Oberhelman","This is Doug Oberhelman, Joel. Are you talking about the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter of the year or the outlook?","Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group","The whole year. So, of that $12.5 billion, if you try to take out, just say inventory was kind of a one-time catch up right and you take out some of the acquisitions as we go forward like you can, underlying growth I\u2019m trying to get, and so underlying growth was maybe 12.5% or 13% if you take some of those things out and I\u2019m trying to figure out what the underlying growth in operating profit just to sort of normalize for a basis for 2012 and 13?","Doug Oberhelman","Yeah, now you\u2019re getting 12% or 13%, I mean, we had $60 billion in sales. Bucyrus and MWM were I think 2.6 of that. So, sort of roughly 57.5 without those two. I think the impact of currency if memory serves me was about $800 million so you\u2019re at 56 \u2013 build was, I think, order magnitude $2.5 billion. So, I mean, we\u2019re at sort 42 to 54 which is 20% excluding all those items, more than 20% about close to 25.","Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group","I will pursue it offline. Can you talk about the pension, any change in the discount rate, what does that mean for after 2012?","Edward Rapp","Yeah, Joel this is Ed. The discount rate went down as we had anticipated, we took a hit to OCI of just $2 billion and in spite of that finished debt capped at 42.7 and really think about it taken in the last 18 months more than $10 billion plus a hit based on pension and to stay within our target range in terms of debt cap and it shows just how good at the year we had on overall cashbook.","Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group","Right. Okay, beautiful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Wells Fargo Securities, good morning everyone.","Doug Oberhelman","Hi Andrew.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Just a question, I guess, back on the cash flow, you had a really good year, I\u2019m just wondering about any change in seasonality that we should think about, I mean Q4 was down a little bit on an operating cash flow just for the quarter itself. But the first three quarter were excellent. So, is there a change with business mix and how you\u2019re thinking about investments that we should consider?","Doug Oberhelman","Hi Andy, this is Doug. I think in terms of investments, we\u2019ve outlined it\u2019s kind of that industry attracted in a strategic fit, a lot of good opportunities for organic growth and I think on the acquisition side, we\u2019re clearly focused on full integration of EMD, MWM and Bucyrus. I think on the cash flow if you really think about the result of 2011, we had some really good year-over-year improvement scenarios like receivables and payables and I don\u2019t you can anticipate that kind of improvement year-over-year again and it\u2019s kind of driving it to what we think are some pretty good levels. The real opportunity on the cash flow on into 2012 will be to continue to deploy the Cat production system, align with our suppliers and through that do a better job on inventory turns. I\u2019d say that would be the area that I give lot of focus as we go into 2012.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thanks for that. And just one follow up on the acquisition activity, you\u2019ve done a lot relative to your history in the last few years, your comment on focusing on the acquisitions that you\u2019ve made, should we just pretty much expect organic growth and inorganic growth to come from what\u2019s already been done or should we have to anticipate, there are holes that you may want to fill in \u201812?","Mike DeWalt","Andy, I think, it\u2019s always hard to speculate and what may come in the M&A space, but as we talked in the past, the acquisitions that make the most sense for us are the ones that bolt on to existing parts of our business. EMD really added to a great real services business, which gives us an ending real business, MWM was a great bolt on to have to build our engine platform on gas and Bucyrus was a big bolt, I mean it was really a perfect build out of our mining business. I would anticipate us to spend a lot of time in 2012 getting those fully integrated. On top of the $4 billion that we\u2019ve talked about relative to and of organic investment in capacity, we got a lot going on in 2012, we\u2019re going to be focused to get that done.","Doug Oberhelman","Yeah, I will pile on a little bit, Oberhelman here. As we sit here today, the strategy that we see for the next three or four years does not, we do not have any big holes to fill and the idea of absolute execution on both our organic growth which is going to be a significantly bigger factor I think and what our acquisitions have been and any new acquisitions is really going to be the focus and we get that right, we will have no problem with our 2015 numbers at all. So, we\u2019re really going to spend some time on that, having said that we\u2019ve got, probably dozens I would say of smaller acquisitions in mine, kind pre \u201809, pre-2010 for Caterpillar that we\u2019re always looking at. We would bolt as Ed said and I think those would compliment our business. But, where we\u2019re headed for 2015, we basically have our arms around today, we intend to deliver that ploy.","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Its Vertical Research Partners and good morning everybody. My question is, you had some real positive signs in the production system with the safety and some of the things you talked about in the press release and you\u2019ve had phenomenal demand. I just wanted to ask if you\u2019re seeing any hiccups or whether the production system is working just as well as you thought, the inventory returns you mentioned, are you seeing increased throughput on fixed asset and can that help in addition to the CapEx where you\u2019re going. Really just wanted to feel what do you think is feeling like CBS?","Mike DeWalt","This is Mike, I\u2019ll start that one out, Rob. Cat production system has been very successful, we\u2019ve talked about this all along, has been more than just, hey, we\u2019re trying to get labor efficiency out of that hit. It\u2019s the whole flow within the factory. For example, I think during this year, if it wasn\u2019t for Cap production system, I don\u2019t think we could have got the volume out of the plants that we did. If you look at our delivery performance to customers today, the lead times if you will. They\u2019re not fantastically short, but I think given the how much volume we\u2019ve added, how much more product that we\u2019re shipping to have them kind of those sort of historic levels at this part of the ramp up, sets volumes about how well Cat production has got. So, if I would characterize it overall, and I\u2019m sure you can pick some factories or even section of the factories where the results have been better or worse. But, I think, overall, I think with the possible exception of actual inventory returns, all the metrics are good. It\u2019s by and large doing what we hoped it would do, expected it will do when we started down this path and we really needed it. I mean, this is just an observation.","One of the comments that I made in the kind of lead in was a comparison. I understand that we lead our previous record. Go back and think about 2008. Our sales in 2008 were $51 billion, this year our sales excluding the acquisitions were probably $58 billion if you take out EMD and MWM and Bucyrus and excluding acquisitions our profit was in that, I think, excluding Bucyrus was 779. And if you adjust for price, the overall volume is not that different than 2008, but our profit is much better and I think its all from operational improvements, as we ramp backup, we\u2019ve done a great job in holding the line on fixed cost growth, we\u2019ve got more production out of the factories, we\u2019ve had good incremental margin pull through. So, I think Cat production is a big contributor to that. Sorry that was a long winded soapbox to your question.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","No, no that\u2019s great. Its sounds like it\u2019s not on your top worries. There\u2019s nothing getting tangled up. So that\u2019s great given the demand out there. Just a quick end-market question, is there any issue with demand for solar, I think they\u2019ve had year-after-year, year-after-year record performance with gas prices and maybe volumes being lower in the US, and also the pipeline compression is as strong. So, just any comment on solar and demand?","Mike DeWalt","Solar and demand was good, it was on a record year this year, they\u2019re going into 2012 with a very good order book, it\u2019s just called above average order cover, it\u2019s a good business around the world. I mean, not just in the US and if you think about it a lot of the needs in oil and gas area right now are basically getting in the oil patch, getting more oil out of existing wells. Just as an example, I know solar has big orders from a large existing customer on a project to do gas injection to a well to get more output of oil. So, solar business is good, they\u2019re starting the year with pretty good order cover and they\u2019re pretty optimistic about 2012.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Great, thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","ISI, good morning. My question is about the incremental margins for 2012 on a core basis, not to be greedy, but you would think if a lot of things working for you in 2012 versus 2011 that you might be able to do better incremental in 2012 and 2011. Your price costs in 2011 were the negative $400 million. Your incentive comp and I know that can change if guidance goes up. As we sit here today, the incentive comp is going to be less of the drag in 2012 than it was in 2011. Your CapEx was up in 2011 versus 2010, so trying to jump in CapEx in 2012 is radical change from the higher depreciation you had observed in 2011 and the currency was negative $400 million or so on, on an evil line in 2011. So, I guess, try to talk me down on why your incremental should not be better in 2012 than 2011 what am I missing?","Mike DeWalt","Just a couple of things, in first half what we have in the outlook is incrementals that are very consistent with 2011 and I tell you this, it\u2019s easier to get higher incrementals the larger your volume increase. I said as many times I can squeeze in that we\u2019ve had the best volume increase on a percentage basis in 2011 since Truman was President. Now, we got another good year of growth built in for 2012, but it\u2019s not the scale of volume increase that we had to determine our percentage basis in 2011. So, I think, the volume not being up as much as probably a little bit of a headwind. One of the things we mentioned this morning in the release was R&D we are looking for about a 15% increase in R&D next year. We have high depreciation, we had a $4 billion capital planning for next year plus we\u2019ll have a full year of impact on the $2.6 billion that we have spent this year. So, depreciation is going to be up. Related to that $4 billion, it requires a fair bit of expense to get that implemented so that will be a little bit of drag. So, there are pluses and minuses the things you mentioned are definitely pluses, incentive comp at target, which is where we started out the year in the outlook, is a tailwind without a doubt. Currency we wouldn\u2019t expect to be quite so bad as it was in 2011. So, to your point that\u2019s a tailwind as well. But I think a smaller volume increase and just the added cost around depreciation, implementation of the new capacity in some more R&D, now those are probably the headwinds.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Do you have a specific price cost baked in relationship for 2012 that may be, that will tell that into about the Tier 4 issue and how you feel you\u2019re coping those costs for 2012 and any sense of pull forward, people buying in front of that.","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, I think for Tier 4, we as in 2011, the difference between the price and oil cost is not material one way or the other it\u2019s been margin neutral at least. So that\u2019s not the big drag for us that\u2019s the implementation Tier 4 just on particularly compared with Tier 3 superbly well. Feedback from dealers is good, no major hiccups in the factory so Tier 4 has been very good.","Doug Oberhelman","I would just add here David that we are now essentially onto our 2015 goals and taking steps to get there and everything Mike said, the big step up in CapEx, the substantial step up in R&D, the price cost relationship being relatively to lead to our market share goal in 2015 are all aimed at steps in Tier 12, 13 and 14 to get there. This is one step along the way. We\u2019ve got to invest to meet those goals. In \u201812 we will some of that it\u2019s a balance. I would also say that we look at 2011 as achieving to 2012 goals that we laid out to all of you in 2009 that is in the rear view mirror.","As Mike took you through that reconciliation it\u2019s also in the report, we feel like we did pretty well, particularly in August of \u201809 when the world was ending by the best estimations at that point in time. We put out a forecast like we did and then to achieve that a year early, I feel pretty good about. So, \u201812 for us is really, maybe the first or second step into our 2015 goals which we will be steering you towards more and more later this year and beyond. But \u201812 is certainly a building block to get there.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","All right, I appreciate the color, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Henry Kirn. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Its UBS, good morning guys.","Mike DeWalt","Hi, Henry.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Can you touch on where you are with lean and maybe how that impacts your expectations for dealer inventory build as we go through 2012?","Edward Rapp","Henry, this is Ed. First of all in terms of relying like you said deal, we came out of kind of a standing star and deployed that and in 2011 we ran somewhere in the neighborhood of 27,000 units through laying, it\u2019s up about 50% versus what we did in 2010 timeframe. If you look at laying to one end to, it\u2019s now up about 55% of our total shipment and so, we continue to ramp that up. We\u2019ve got more to go, but I think we\u2019re making good progress there. In terms of dealer inventory build, I would say that as we finish 2011, we finished with dealer inventory to about where we wanted from a months to sales perspective. So, as we move forward I think you\u2019ll see dealer inventory kind of move with sales growth because I think the month\u2019s sales were about right. So as I look at 2012it would be a modest, our outlook would include a modest growth in dealer inventory just along with the sales growth.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","That\u2019s helpful. And as extended delivery times start to take hold, could you talk about how that impacts your expectation for pins over the next year?","Edward Rapp","Doug hit it earlier and we made some major commitments in 2010 to invest in capacity, we continue to add on in 2011 and we\u2019re going to do it again. You\u2019ve seen in our release, our sales growth outpace the industry growth and so, we think the capacity that we\u2019re adding is going to allow us to stay ahead of that curve.","Doug Oberhelman","We\u2019ve had it, basically monthly announcement more or less and almost for last two years now with growth or acquisition, those investments are starting to come online. We are saying on the large factory is now online and ramping. Victoria Texas is the new excavator plant will begin to ramp in the third quarter, I go on and on with this, but those investments are really just starting to return the money I guess, as we get production to those. So, we\u2019ll see that in \u201812 and \u201813 will be big build here as well \u201814. we will be adding capacity right on through to do that and that should help our availability and certainly will get after our market share goals for 2015.","Mike DeWalt","This is Mike, I was going to pile one more here. Henry, when are talking about extended lead times don\u2019t confuse that with sales aren\u2019t going up a lot in mining in 2012 because they are. So, we expect good sales increases in mining, the point that we\u2019re trying to make is that actual demand is even better. And there is one other comment, we tried make this but sometimes you don\u2019t always get your messages across. 2012 we are looking to be another record year with sales for us at a midpoint of around $70 billion. And remember that with US construction, I mean, housing starts at 700,000 I mean that\u2019s historically law, I mean, it\u2019s following the tradition, at some point construction in the US is going to pick up, Europe will eventually come out of its recession, we will get some housing, we will hopefully eventually get a highway built and at some point those two big pillars of our business which are not better but not still at the levels we\u2019re going to need quite a bit more capacity. So, this story isn\u2019t over. I mean, in the US and in Europe the two big developed regions are part of our business. We are still languishing at well below prior peak levels.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Thanks a lot, congratulations.","Mike DeWalt","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Good morning, it\u2019s Goldman Sachs. Can you give us some more color on the $4 billion CapEx budget, what are the most meaning in new capacity additions and if you could touch on mining accelerator capacity and give us some more context on the restructuring actions at CAT Japan? Thanks.","Mike DeWalt","Okay. I\u2019ll start with the first, I remember the first and the last and you probably have to remind me the middle question when we get to it. On the $4 billion what I would say is its spread out. Some of it is spending on projects that we already announced. A lot of it is for mining as Doug mentioned, we\u2019ve got facility in Texas, a lot of the project that we\u2019ve announced were also spending a lot of money at existing facilities, in fact, probably, the majority of it is that existing facilities we\u2019re ramp up. In 2011, we did a little bit more than half, I think it was 60% of our CapEx for facilities in the US. In 2011, it will be likely in mix as well, we\u2019re investing in the US and overseas. In terms of specific sort of project by project guidance, we will pass on that.","Your last question was on CAT Japan?","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","That\u2019s right.","Mike DeWalt","In CAT Japan, it\u2019s actually a good story, we\u2019re restructuring our manufacturing operations in Asia and CAT Japan as a key part of that. We impaired some assets in our Sagami facility that we would intend to sell in 2012. So, big chunk of the charge in the fourth quarter was for that plus there is some employee cost related to it as well. But its essentially restructuring our operations for our Asian manufacturing strategy.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","And Mike, can you talk about where you\u2019re seeing on supplier on-time deliveries and adherence to 90-day schedules exiting 2011 and also touch on what kind of increases in period and SG&A costs are, you expecting this year relative to the increases in \u201811?","Edward Rapp","Hi, Jerry, this is Ed. I would say, and Mike commented on this in his opening and we got to give our suppliers full marks. I mean, if you talk about going from the $32 billion in \u201809 to kind of what we finished up this year, from a supplier its even benefit because of the inventory at \u201809 timeframe. I think supplier delivery performance was what really helped us come up at volume curve and we\u2019re working closely with that in terms of making sure we stay and sink as we add capacity, they add capacity, we\u2019re doing the very same thing with the dealer organization as we try to execute if you would simultaneously.","On the cost side, we remain very focused at controlling cost as we go up this ramp. Mike did the comparison earlier back in that \u201808 timeframe but as we ramp volume up in that period of time, we allowed cost to kind of reflect in line with sales, you saw us do a good job in 2011 in holding that down at less than 50% of that ramp and you will see us focused on that again in 2012. Yeah, there is similarities like R&D and the cost implement capacity that we got to put in place but we\u2019re going to remain cost stocks as we control the cost side of this equation.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eli Lustgarten. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Good morning, Longbow Securities, terrific quarter guys.","Mike DeWalt","We heard you on TV this morning, Eli.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Hope I did a good job for you.","Mike DeWalt","You did.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Couple of clarifications. The guidance does not include any of the impact of the Bucyrus service business, is that correct?","Mike DeWalt","That\u2019s correct. It\u2019s our belief that it won\u2019t be very significant this year.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Okay, the only question we will need from you, is difference between the impact in operating profit and how much is gained on the sale of a transaction that would not be as repealing and you don\u2019t expect that to be material, is that what I am getting through here?","Mike DeWalt","Well, I think the overall impact of the transaction which is business that\u2019s going to the dealers and impact on us, reducing intangible amortization that goes along with it. Just all in, some of its timing, they didn\u2019t all happen on January 1, it just look like its going to have a very significant impact on our results in 2012. Now, as we go through each quarter as we have been, it\u2019s a big acquisition, it wasn\u2019t in our results a year ago and will continue throughout 2012 to kind of talk about the impact like we did EMD this year.","Doug Oberhelman","Eli, the only thing I would add to that is, it\u2019s going to be a challenge like Mike said, over 50 transitions during the year, but I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re starting to see the benefits of being able to go to our customer base with an extended product line, and I think we get this done and our dealers can go with full product line, full service offerings, I think we are actually convinced more and more each day, it\u2019s the right direction to go.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","You indicated inventory as sort of imbalanced with historic norms, can you talk about that geographically, I mean, the impression we had that US inventories would probably still be little bit light, and in some parts of the world it maybe little bit higher, is that correct?","Mike DeWalt","No, Eli. I would geographically we got pretty good balance in terms of where we are at, I mean, I do think, we did see it come up a little bit in North America in the latter parts of the years they gained confidence, you got it up a little bit in China as you kind of prepare for the selling season, we know, all know what happens coming out of the Chinese New Year. The other place from a geographic perspective we\u2019ve seen it build is on mining related product just based on the lead time to simple as that mining product has continued to grow. I feel pretty good about where we are at geographically as well as by different parts of the business.","Doug Oberhelman","It didn\u2019t answer his question, but I expect, it might inferred. Ed made comment about China and a little bit of inventory build there. I just wanted to kind of clarify one thing, if you look at our total company sales in China fourth quarter to fourth quarter and you take the impact of inventory build out of both, we would still be enough in China.","Edward Rapp","I\u2019m kind of surprised we didn\u2019t get a question on China, so I am going to give an answer or at least an opinion. But, I think its important for all of you to understand and really know what we are up to in China. China for us is a big market that we\u2019re bring the capital, broad set of business, products and services into, in a big way. So that\u2019s financing power systems, its machines, its locomotives, it\u2019s everything we do. And I have read there has been far too much encrypt about us being only excavator supplier in China, which I think is a bit thinker. Because we are installing a base over there of dealers that will sell our broader ray of products and services, it will go after everything, in fact if you look at our overall they are up year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter because of that (inaudible) in the excavator business. But because of the breadth that we bring, we can really spread the rest through China, it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing and on top of that building inventory as Mike just said in China, we are getting after market share in a big way and like here some of that come to provision. So, we have, as we told before some big win in China plans by 2015, if anything I am optimistic we\u2019re going to be a little bit ahead of that because of the breadth that China took in slowing their account which allowed us to catch up a little bit and then the speed in which we are putting our entire business model across China. So, China is a big opportunity for us, its paying off beautifully here and you saw that in the fourth quarter and year-to-year.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Let me just follow that. We\u2019re spending $4 billion in CapEx, is that level put in next two years or we will continue to go up, it sound just to me, some of the expectation between now and 2015, the cap of spending is probably going to continue to rise for couple of years.","Mike DeWalt","Eli, I don\u2019t recall making an outlook on capital spending for \u201813 and \u201814 but as Doug kind of mentioned earlier, we have both good, solid goals for 2015, we are well above where we are at right now. So, I think it\u2019s a reasonable assumption if you would think of an elevated CapEx to deliver that a while.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Hi, good morning, it\u2019s RBC. Just wanted to go back to an earlier question on the mining business, I mean, there is clearly or clearly saying decoupling here with US coal being weak, can you give us an idea of how much of the business today is tied to, I guess even may be the OE business to US coal, whether it\u2019s thermal, or thermal plus?","Mike DeWalt","Well, coal is certainly without a doubt by a pretty long shot the most worldwide is the most significant mining commodity and it is most important to our business, but it is not just US, I mean US has a big coal market of course, but Australia, Indonesia and China has a huge coal market, not as big for us yet, but witness our investment, hope to our investment in underground coal in China. One that we would like to take advantage of. So, mining overall including coal, we have a big backlog of, it is not good, customers are bullish, we\u2019ve not really split it out by commodity, by region, but I don\u2019t think there is any big weakness that I\u2019ve at least heard about anecdotally in the US in our business anyway.","Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Okay, thanks. I guess, can we switch over to Europe then, your outlook for machine business flat up is more bullish than we\u2019ve heard elsewhere. Anyhow I appreciate the fact that fleets are old and they need to be refurbished, but can you give us any additional color on what gives you confidence that that market is not going to worse through the rest of the year?","Mike DeWalt","Well, I think the most recent confidence if you will is just let, this is not a new thing, I mean, this has been Europe has been in the news last six months, I mean, big time. Order rates in the fourth quarter versus year ago just in Europe were decidedly up. So, just recent order rates from us despite all of the discussion of it being more positive. Now, happy of course, if somebody other parts of the world, not as part of the US, but in the right direction. I would say that\u2019s one thing that gives us confident, I think how far the market fell in \u201809 and how far below in years, the prior peak and industry sales are relative discuss appropriate or replacements, I think all of those kind of triangulate to give us some confidence as well. But, I think probably the key point on confidence is just what dealers and customers have been doing over the last few months.","Europe, Western Europe anyway and to some degree pieces going east, but question here up is really pure dichotomy of north and south. And southern European is really on its knees and Northern Europe was doing pretty well, in fact, still is even though the entirety of Western Europe might be in recession, probably yes. So, you really got to watch that in terms of country by country and then you break it down in country, there is a lot of special project. In France, a big high speed rail, second one is coming to provision, so it\u2019s really a tale of two stories north and south as much anything. That\u2019s really that\u2019s been helping us and it just depends on how much along with kiosk and Southern Europe that\u2019s goes on and its been going on a long time and hasn\u2019t tanked the place yet. We don\u2019t think it will.","Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Okay, thank you very much, I appreciate the color guys.","Mike DeWalt","I think we have, just about the end of our time, but will take time for one more.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Hi, Jeffries and thanks for sneaking me and you can answer very quickly if you would like. What are chance as we get back to the share repurchase in 2012?","Mike DeWalt","Well, I think the short answer to that in 2012 is probably no.","Doug Oberhelman","I could make it shorter but that was adequate.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","That definitely works for me and Mike sorry if I miss this but FX impact in 2012 probably a headwind did you quantify that?","Mike DeWalt","No, we didn\u2019t but certainly less than 2011.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Headwind, but less than 2011?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","And finally, if I could just in the past you commented sort of broadly it looks like the street has seasonally fairly balanced through the course of 2012, little bit lower in the first quarter, but we are hearing from lot other companies that may be things are weaker in the first half and then pick up in the second half do you want to give us any guidance there?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, we don\u2019t do quarterly guidance but that\u2019s actually a good way to end that\u2019s worth a little bit of the discussion. I mean, seasonally for us its on sale the first quarter is almost always the weak quarter of the year, I don\u2019t see any reason why this year would be any different than that. So, I certainly wouldn\u2019t divide the year of sales by four and assume that\u2019s gone in the first quarter. Also to on incrementals, I think we ought to get this out right now, if we go back to 2011, we just had a golden quarter in the first quarter, I mean, costs unusually seasonally low but were particularly good. Price realization was particularly higher in the first quarter of 2011. We had operating profit as a percent of sales was well above the rest of the year in the first quarter. So, I would just temper if you will the incremental margin expectations for Q1. Not because there is going to be some big change in operations on our part but because the first quarter a year ago was just so good.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Great, that\u2019s very helpful thanks.","Mike DeWalt","All right, thank you very much everyone and we will be talking to you over the coming days.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Michael I. DeWalt","Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President, Strategic Services. And on the call today, I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson. This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. Any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without our expressed written consent is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website, and it'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, which is Risk Factors, of our Form 10-K that we filed with the SEC in February of 2014, and it's also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release.","In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can also be found in today's release, which has also been posted on our website at caterpillar.com.","Now before I get into the details, I should also mention that we made organizational changes that went into effect at the start of 2014; responsibility for paving, forestry, industrial and waste and tunnel boring products moved from Resource Industries, and you'll find it in the financial release today in our all other operating segments line.","In addition, responsibility for some work tools was moved from Resource Industries to Construction Industries, and the responsibility for administration of 3 wholly owned dealers in Japan moved from Construction Industries, and it's also in the all other operating segment in today's release.","We also reclassified restructuring costs for 2013. We moved it from segment profit to corporate items, and we did that to be consistent with how we're presenting 2014.","The most significant impact of these changes on our reportable segments was for Resource Industries. And to put that in context, for the full year of 2013, that reorganization moved about $1.5 billion of sales from Resource Industries, but it had very little impact on profit for Resource Industries. In fact, only about $10 million for the full year.","Now after these changes, the vast majority of Resource Industries sales are related to mining and quarry and aggregates. We put a Q&A on this morning's release on the reorg. It's Q&A #7 on Page 17, and it includes a quarterly breakdown of the impact for Resource Industries.","Now we also changed the name of our Power Systems segment to Energy & Transportation. We did that to better reflect what the segment actually does, and we made the changes before our Analyst Meeting at CONEXPO last March. But if you missed it, Power Systems is now Energy & Transportation.","Okay, let's get into first quarter results.","At $13.2 billion, sales and revenues were flat with the first quarter of 2013 and were pretty close to what we expected. Profit was $1.61 a share, excluding restructuring costs, and $1.44, including restructuring costs. The restructuring costs were $149 million or about $0.17 a share. Most of the $149 million was related to the previously announced restructuring of our Gosselies, Belgium manufacturing facility.","Now to better compare results to the first quarter of 2013, the remainder of my discussion on the quarter will be excluding restructuring charges.","The profit of $1.61, excluding restructuring, was $0.29 a share higher than the first quarter of 2013.","While in the aggregate, sales were unchanged from last year, if you look at our 3 large segments, there were very different stories and I'll cover each one. The most positive was Construction Industries. And it was up 20% from the first quarter of last year. And in fact, this quarter, it was our largest segment by sales, which were over $5 billion and up more than $800 million from first quarter last year. They were up about 36% in North America, 20% in Europe, Africa, Middle East, up about 10% in Asia Pacific, and were almost flat in Latin America.","Now to understand what happened in Construction Industries sales, you do need to consider dealer inventory. It was a big part of why sales were relatively weak last year. Normally, during the first quarter of each year, dealers buy more from us than they deliver to customers, and they build inventory for the second quarter, we call it the selling season, and that means that for a dealer deliveries to end-users, the second quarter is usually the highest quarter of the year. Now that inventory build didn't happen for Construction last year. And that's because dealers ended 2012 with sufficient inventory of construction equipment and their inventories during the first quarter remained pretty flat a year ago.","This year, that wasn't the case and dealers reverted to the more usual seasonal pattern and built inventory in the first quarter for sale in the second quarter selling season.","Now in addition to the dealer inventory impact, end-user demand also increased versus the first quarter of last year. And you may have seen that in our release of dealer statistics yesterday, where dealer deliveries for the first 3 months of 2014 were up 9% for Construction Industries. Bottom line, for Construction Industries, demand's better for construction, and we believe dealer inventories are in pretty good shape relative to seasonal needs. Okay, that's Construction.","For Energy & Transportation, sales were up about 8% in the quarter. Remember, Energy & Transportation is made up of several sales that serve several industries: oil and gas, power generation, transportation and industrial. And oil and gas, power gen and industrial were all up a bit more than the 8% average that Energy & Transportation was up as a whole.","Transportation related sales were about flat versus the first quarter last year.","Energy & Transportation has been a stable performer over the past year, and that certainly continued in the first quarter.","Let's move on to Resource Industries, which, again, is principally mining. That's a different story. Sales were down 37% from the first quarter of 2013, and most of the decline was end-user demand which, again, you can see in the retail statistics that we released yesterday where deliveries of new equipment were down 46% in the first quarter versus the same period a year ago.","The decline we're seeing in the mining industry began in the mid-2012 and it's continued. And the business declined throughout last year. And because of that, the first quarter of 2013 was last year's highest sales for Resource Industries and it came down from there. So that's making it a particularly tough sales comparison for us, Q1 to Q1.","For Resource Industries, order rates for new equipment have remained weak in the first quarter and substantially below the peaks of 2012. That's the bad news.","The good news is that we were close to an equilibrium of order rates in sales in the first quarter. And as a result, the order backlog for Resource Industries was fairly close to being flat with year end 2013.","So in summary on sales, Construction Industries up, Energy & Transportation up, and Resource Industries down quite a bit. Sales overall, as a result, flat. But while sales were flat, profit was up. In general, it was a pretty good story across each of our 3 large segments. And I think because of that, it make sense to talk about profit this quarter by segment.","And I'll start with Construction Industries, which had a great quarter, with operating profit up $460 million on a sales increase of $845 million. And I think there are 3 things to cover with Construction Industries. One, you have to go back to last year, think about the first quarter of last year. Our sales and production were relatively low. And partly, that's because we and our dealers started 2013 with probably too much inventory. And in the first quarter of last year, most of the factories that we have that make construction equipment were at least partially idled.","This year, we were producing more. And with our factories producing more, we were doing it more efficiently. Related to that, inventory reductions from last year resulted in negative inventory absorption impacts on profit, and this year, that was much, much less.","Second thing about Resource -- or I'm sorry, Construction Industries profit, we've continued to focus on managing costs, and we were able to hold our period costs. Those are costs that are relatively fixed. We've held them flat with last year despite a pretty significant increase in production volume.","And the third thing about Construction profit was currency. And currency impacts versus a year ago were positive for us and mostly related to the yen. And remember, we are a net yen exporter. We're a Japanese manufacturer.","So all in all, profit for Construction Industries in the first quarter was the best since the second quarter of 2012.","Okay, let's move onto Energy & Transportation, which had another good quarter, with operating profit rising $236 million on a sales increase of $371 million. And that resulted in operating profit as a percent of sales being up from the first quarter of last year.","Now the increase in our profit dollars was primarily due to higher sales volume, lower manufacturing costs, and price realization for Energy & Transportation was slightly favorable.","Now when you think about Energy & Transportation, and profit over the course of 2013, it's probably worth noting that the first quarter last year was the weakest profit quarter of 2013, and Energy & Transportation margins improved over the last 3 quarters of the year. And the operating margin rate in the first quarter of '14 this quarter was reasonably in line with the last 3 quarters of 2013. Thankfully, it's a diverse business. It's been a consistent performer over the past year and that includes this quarter.","Let's turn to our Resource Industries. Operating profit for Resource Industries, again, that's predominantly mining, was down substantially versus the first quarter. Operating profit declined $310 million on a sales decline of $1.2 billion. That's the bad news.","The good news is the decremental margin rate, that's the change in margin divided by the change in sales, was a mere 25%. And that's a demonstration, in our view, of good cost management in a business with a very variable margin rate that are much higher than 25%. Resource Industries has made substantial progress on reducing costs as demand has declined.","Operating margin as a percent of sales is now mid-single digits. But for a capital-intensive business where demand has been hit this hard, we think that's pretty good performance. It's a business where sales of its most significant product, mining trucks, are expected to be down this year about 80% from the peak year of 2012. To be even profitable in an environment like this demonstrates the success they've had in managing costs.","Okay, that's operating profit. Let's turn to the outlook for 2014. Now in our year end financial release from January, we provided an outlook for 2014 sales and profit. We said we expected sales and revenues to be similar to 2013 at about $56 billion, and we put that in a range of plus or minus 5%. We said then that there were encouraging signs in the world economy, and that we were expecting sales improvements in Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation. And that's still the case.","Our outlook in January expected construction and Energy & Transportation to be up about 5%, and that's still the case for Energy & Transportation. However, we increased our view of Construction from up 5% to up 10%. However, in our original outlook, we expected sales to be down in our Resource Industries segment by about 10%. In this outlook, we've reduced that forecast and now expect it to be down about 20% from 2013.","Despite the prospects for a better year in the world economy and continued strong production at mines, mining orders for new equipment haven't really improved and remain at pretty low levels.","Order rates are a fraction of where they were in 2011 and during the first half of 2012, and are substantially below where we believe the long term sustainable level is.","Our outlook from January expected mining orders for 2014 to remain low, but be modestly better than the second half of 2013. So far this year, that hasn't happened. And based on where we are today, even if we started to see some improvement in orders, it likely wouldn't be soon enough to have much impact on 2014. And that's why we lowered the Resource Industries outlook today. That's the bad news.","The good news is, new mining equipment sales in our outlook are low enough that we believe the downside risk for 2014, in our outlook related to Resource Industries, is reasonably limited. That doesn't mean that it couldn't go down further. That just means that the sales of new equipment for mining are so low in the outlook that even if there is no improvement in order rates at all, the downside in the scheme of things is limited.","So overall, our outlook for sales and revenues remain $56 billion in a range of plus or minus 5%. There's certainly potential, it could be higher than $56 billion if economic activity around the world accelerates or if mining orders increased meaningfully in the short term. But there's also plenty of downside risk that could cause it to be below $56 billion. A couple of examples include geopolitical. While we're hopeful that the situation in Russia and the Ukraine will be resolved, if it does get worse, and has an impact on business confidence, world trade and world growth, it could certainly be a negative for us.","And we're closely watching growth rates in China. We had a good first quarter in China. In fact, company sales were up 30%. But we're concerned that if economic growth in China slows enough, it could have an impact on our business. Those are 2 good reasons why we have a 5% plus\/minus range around our $56 billion sales outlook.","Now in terms of the profit outlook. On the strength of our great first quarter results, we raised our full year operating profit by $0.25 a share. Excluding restructuring costs, our profit outlook moved from $5.85 to $6.10. And with restructuring charges, our costs had moved from $5.30 to $5.55 a share.","Now our overall expectations for our restructuring costs in 2014 remains at about $400 million to $500 million, with the midpoint impact on profit per share of about $0.17.","Okay. To help you think about the rest of the year, there's one more thing I'd like to cover in the outlook, and that's how we think the rest of the year could shake out by quarter.","Of the 3 remaining quarters of 2014, of course, that's Q2, Q3, Q4, we would expect of those 3, the fourth quarter will be the highest for sales and profit. We think the third quarter will likely be the weakest and that the second quarter will be slightly below the average of Q2, Q3 and Q4 in terms of sales and profit. I hope that helps you calibrate your expectations for 2014.","One last point before we move to the Q&A. We had a good quarter for operating cash flow. We were up from $1.1 billion in the first quarter of last year to $1.9 billion in the first quarter of this year. Our balance sheet remain strong, with a debt-to-capital ratio for Machinery and Energy & Transportation of near 30%. And during the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of stock. And over the last 4 quarters, we've repurchased about $3.7 billion.","In January, the board authorized a new 5-year program to repurchase an additional $10 billion in stock. And while we've not announced additional repurchase for this year, as we move through 2014, we'll certainly continue to review our options for cash deployment. So that's our rundown of the quarter and the outlook.","With that, we're ready to move on to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ted Grace.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Susquehanna. I was hoping, Mike, maybe you could walk through, specific to Construction Industries, how production kind of progressed through 1Q, and how you would encourage us to think about production in Construction Industries in the second quarter. I realized you gave that quarterly guidance and that in itself is helpful on a consolidated basis, but could you maybe just help us understand how production and cost absorption worked through 1Q, and how you would encourage us to think about 2Q?","Michael I. DeWalt","Yes. I'll -- we actually stretched it a little far, farther than we normally do on guidance for the rest of the year, so I'm going to be a little hesitant on breaking it out even further. But what I can tell you is this. If you go -- if you just think about how it's changed over the course of the past year, as we came into 2013 a year ago, we were cutting our inventory, our PDC finished inventory. And dealers, you would normally add inventory in the first quarter and they didn't do that. So our production a year ago was pretty low for Construction. And if you look at the first quarter of this year, dealers built inventory as this kind of a normal pattern. And as a result of that, and us not making as substantial reductions to PDC inventory, our production went up a lot. Our production was up more in the first quarter than sales. I think if you look forward for the rest of the year, you can kind of do the math on this a little bit based on us saying sales up 10% for Construction over the course of the year. The rest of the year for Construction Industries sales will be probably not massively different than the first quarter. So probably not wide variations in production because the sales numbers, the first quarter was not far off, being 1\/4 of the year.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. The second thing I was hoping to ask is, on the restructuring side, just an update on where things stand in Europe, specific to Belgium. And then in the press release, it seemed like that you may have cited more potential restructuring benefits in the year. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that.","Michael I. DeWalt","We certainly weren't trying to signal more restructuring benefits in the year. I think Gosselies' restructuring is coming along about as we expected. We got approval in the first quarter from the local officials. I was expecting maybe a question on why the entire $300 million that we were expecting for the year wasn't in the first quarter, and that's because we'll be recognizing the expense related to that as the -- as we get specifics on the individuals that have accepted the offer. So that will probably come in through the course of the year. I would say, if you look at all the restructuring activity that we have done over the course of the past year, one of the places you can see it is actually in employment. If you think about this, our sales in the first quarter of this year were about the same as the first quarter of last year. And if you look at the employment schedule in our quarterly release today, on flat sales, our employment levels are down, I think, 8,000 to 9,000 people. And I think that's where you can see the impact of not just lower volume, but also some of the restructuring activities we've taken.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It's Jefferies. And I have a question about the revision in your outlook. And I guess I'm wondering, maybe 2 parts on the Construction business. What and where are you seeing the improvement that gives you the visibility on the 5% improvement on the top line that you talked about, Mike? And then on the Resource side, I'm curious, you talked about the OE being pretty limited at this point, but can you just discuss a little bit about what you're seeing on the aftermarket side, and whether that's still declining? It sounds like it is, but what's the outlook there?","Michael I. DeWalt","So a couple of things. One, with Construction, I think the one area, geographic area, that's, I would say, has had the most upside for us is actually North America. And you can kind of see that, I think, in the retail statistics that we've provided. It's doing pretty good. So I'd say North America is the reason for the upside. On Resource Industries, on your comment specifically, aftermarket, and in our release today, we did say that, versus the first quarter of last year within aftermarket -- or within Resource Industries, parts sales were lower than a year ago, and that's true. But they came down over the course of last year. I mean, if you look at parts sales within aftermarket -- within, I'm sorry, Resource Industries, over the last few quarters, it's been stable. It's not down like it was from Q1. So it fell during last year. It's held pretty stable over the last couple of quarters. And now we're hopeful at some point in time here, it'll start to tick up. It seems like it should.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I guess pricing in both of those segments was a little bit weak, a little bit negative, should we worry about that? What's the outlook there?","Michael I. DeWalt","We're not really expecting much sale or a much price at all this year. I mean, when we came into the year, we said, I think, less than 0.5%, if memory serves me, which is, in the scheme of things for us, pretty small. I think that if you look at the 4 quarters of last year, actually, pricing levels were probably, in those businesses, a little better in the first quarter than they were for the rest of the year, so it was a little bit of a tougher comp for us. There's certainly pricing pressure out in the marketplace and that's why we're not expecting much for the year. But overall, our view on pricing, by and large, hasn't changed much from when we came into the year.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Eli Lustgarten.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Longbow Securities. Can we talk a little bit -- when you talk about Construction Industries, you sort of -- in your commentary, you basically said that the rest of the year, volume levels went up even radically altered from the first quarter. Can you talk about the profitability of this sector for the rest of the year? I mean, you had a very impressive first quarter for lots of reasons. Are you -- I mean, I assume you're expecting double-digit operating margin in the sector, but not quite up to the first quarter level. Is that a fair representation of what to expect for the rest of the year?","Bradley M. Halverson","Yes, Eli, this is Brad Halverson. That's a good question. One, I would say that we're extremely happy with the profitability of the Construction Industries. We had an operating margin of around 5% kind of in our core product line. If you look back a year, we finished the fourth quarter at 9.9%. We like this business to be double digits. We did have good mix. Some positive things happened in the first quarter that they gave us a record return for the Construction business at 13.6%. I would say, an expectation for the rest of the year, slightly above a double-digit number would be a good estimate, and we think that's good profitability for where this business is at right now.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Yes. Eli, it's Doug Oberhelman here. I would just add a comment on the pull-through objectives we've had going back a number of years of 25% on the additional $1 of revenue. And while we did much better than that in Construction, in Energy & Transport, this quarter, I would expect that over time, 25% is our objective. So we'll have some quarters that are juicy like this one and maybe some that aren't so juicy, I guess. But overall, we're after that. And as Mike said in his comments, even our Resource business on the way down held with 25%. So I'm pretty happy with that. But I'd steer it that way as an answer to your question. And if it comes up better than that, great, but there'll be quarters when we'll be talking about the other side of that.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. And along the same line, when you look at Energy & Transportation, with the first quarter volume up 8% and the year up 5%, we're talking, maybe slower top line growth, but I assume that we're expecting better product mix for the rest of the year that will enhance the profitability to match last year's numbers; is that sort of the expectation that we should look at in that sector?","Michael I. DeWalt","Yes, Eli, there are -- that segment has -- serves a bunch of different industries that have, let's say, sort of different profitability characteristics. So in any quarter that you get into, you're subject to a little up and down on margin. Based on whether the increase is oil and gas or industrial engines, they have a different margin profile. If you look at what Energy & Transportation has done over the last 4 quarters, the margin rate has been within a relatively tight demand. And I don't think our view for the rest of the year would have it being dramatically up one side of the other of that. So it's been a consistent performer. And I think our view of the rest of the year is that it will continue to be a consistent performer.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. And one final question. Will you talk a bit of what we should expect out of the finance company this year given the changes in the first quarter, weakness in the first quarter?","Bradley M. Halverson","Yes. Eli, this is Brad Halverson. The Financial Products division, I think has continued to perform very well. Their profit was down compared to the first quarter of last year. But in the first quarter of 2013, we had a positive adjustment due to improved warranty, improved quality. And we have a Cat Insurance business in Cat Financial. So we had, I think, it was roughly $40 million positive adjustment in the first quarter. So their results quarter-over-quarter are slightly up, their portfolio is growing slightly. Their past dues at the end of the first quarter were, I think, a record in the last 10 years or so. And so their portfolio is performing well. I think you can expect similar to Energy & Transportation, pretty good, stable performance out of them the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It's RBC. I'm just trying to reconcile the comment about Construction on the aftermarket sales being flattish in the quarter. I mean, wouldn't -- if the demand is really improving, wouldn't you expect to see an increase in aftermarket sales for the Construction business?","Michael I. DeWalt","I think aftermarket for the Construction business, for any businesses, usually related to activity. It was pretty flat for the first quarter versus a year ago. It's not as -- aftermarket is not quite as -- I don't know, maybe relative to the total, as significant as it might be in industries like mining. As activity goes up, as Construction spending goes up, as housing starts go up, you would think that would as well. It might have something to do a little bit, Seth, with a particularly bad winter. That might have put a little damper on actually work being done. Other than that, I don't know of any big reasons why it should be off that pattern.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess a similar question on the Resource business. Are you seeing -- are customers still idling equipment or bleeding off of parts inventory? Because we are starting to get the sense that some commodity production volumes are going -- are rising like U.S. coal. So can you give us a sense for where you think your customers stand on their parts inventory levels? And how they're -- how soon you think we could see a pickup in that business?","Michael I. DeWalt","I don't know about the inventory levels. But again, if you kind of look sequentially at what's going on over the last 3 months, it's not continued to go down. It's remained pretty stable over the last 3 quarters actually. I think as activity goes up, we would fully expect part sales to go up. I mean, there's a pretty strong relationship. Customers can only put off maintenance or cannibalize idle equipment or idle the oldest equipment for so long before that begins to catch up with you. And the dynamics of a business that's pretty tough on equipment, that starts to come through. So I think, at some point here, we would think that it would pick up.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But do you get the sense that the idling is still occurring then?","Michael I. DeWalt","Yes. I think there's definitely still some parked fleets. It's not the same everywhere in the world, but yes, I think -- I won't quote a number, but yes, there's definitely still parked fleets.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Goldman Sachs. Mike, you had nearly a 10% SG&A and R&D reduction on flat sales this quarter. Can you talk about, is there something in the comparable period or is that consistent with your expectations for the year? And then the restructuring actions in Resources on the manufacturing side came over the course of last year, and I'm just wondering how far along in harvesting those savings are we at the first quarter compared to the ultimate run rate?","Michael I. DeWalt","Jerry, this is Mike. I'll start this. Now we had a very good first quarter. Costs were lower than a year ago, but I think we also were very cautious coming into the year. We purposefully tried to slow down -- even what we have in the hopper for program spending over the course of the year, we tried as much as we could to be very cautious on spending even what we planned to do for the first quarter. And so I think that helped. And as some of those programs that we want to do because they're the right thing for the long term, but we've been cautious on in the first quarter, I think there will be some increase in spending over the remainder of the year for programs like that. That's why if you look at the profitability of the -- in our outlook for the next 3 quarters, that's one of the reasons why it's down a little bit relative to Q1. But again, I'll go back to a comment that I made earlier. This is actually a total company question. We've taken a lot of costs out since the first quarter of last year. And I think if you look at the employment numbers, that kind of -- and particularly because this quarter was a quarter that had almost dead, flat sales, it really -- I think it really brings home the magnitude of the actions that we've taken to adjust the cost base to the current volume situation.","Bradley M. Halverson","And I might add, this is Brad Halverson. We're really happy with the quality of our earnings. We're focused on the business model. We're growing share, little price. And we're really focused on lean deployments across the enterprise, both in our factories and in the office. And so we had increased short-term incentive pay expense in the first quarter, which we're happy about going to our employees based on our performance of roughly $140 million. So we had roughly $500 million of pure cost reduction for us. And so with the mining business that's contributing just a little over $100 million, that used to contribute $1 billion, that will come back. And where our cost structure is, we're going to continue to focus on this, but we're happy with where we're at.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then can you talk about what you're seeing in Western Europe for Construction and Energy & Transportation? I know you're concerned about Eastern Europe, but it sounds like cement volumes are finally starting to pick up and maybe operating hours are starting to improve. I'm wondering if you could just touch on if you're seeing a pickup in demand off of low levels in Western Europe across your businesses.","Michael I. DeWalt","Well, I was just looking at the Construction numbers this morning. And if you look at our first quarter, actually, Construction in Europe was positive. It wasn't negative. So yes, I think it's not as robust as what we're seeing in North America. But I think it's probably little bit of a case where the economic situation there doesn't seem quite so dire. And I think the environment for customers to do some machine replacements is probably a little bit better, and we're seeing that, some positive in our Construction numbers in Europe in general.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Steven Fisher.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's UBS. Just trying to get a sense of the growth rate of the segments that you moved to the all other category as it compares to the core mining business. If you didn't do the re-class, would mining still have been down 20%, or for the year, would have been kind of more or less than that? Because I guess if the stuff you moved into all other is not quite as bad, then the reduction in guidance might not be as severe.","Michael I. DeWalt","So what we moved last year was -- last year -- for the full year anyway, it was $1.5 billion. It's the kind of product that would more closely, in most cases, more closely follow construction paving, for example. Forestry has a relationship, say, with housing construction. So it would have been a year-over-year, at least year-over-year first quarter to first quarter, it would have been a little bit positive. So it was -- it's a different profile than mining. I haven't -- honestly, I haven't looked at that level of detail in the outlook. But it wouldn't surprise me of what you say, is to some small degree, true. The difference, though, is that it's a smaller portion. It was a relatively small portion of Resource Industries. So I don't think the impact would have been that, on the percent change, the 10% to 20%. I don't think it would have been massively significant to that, but it probably -- it's certainly wouldn't have been down 20%, it would have been likely up.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then to get to that minus 20% from minus 37% in Q1 in Resources, are you assuming any year-over-year growth at all or just kind of significant moderations in the decline?","Michael I. DeWalt","When you say year-over-year growth, I'm -- explain a little bit more, Steve.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","No, just the -- because you have to do better than the minus 37% in the balance, in the decline. Is that just a rate that's well below the 20%, or could you actually see something that's up year-over-year?","Michael I. DeWalt","Yes. I think as we go through the year, you'll see that gap narrow. I probably wouldn't want to be so specific as to say, at fourth quarter, it's up or down. But if you just think about the trajectory of last year, it started out stronger. I mean, there were orders that were being produced and shipped, and sales were higher. And it declined as you went through the year. I think the fourth quarter, if memory serves me right, for Resource Industries, it was about 20% below the first quarter. So I think if we get any kind of a modest improvement going through this year, it'll narrow that gap. So I would think that year-over-year gap would come down probably in every quarter.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Wells Fargo. I just wanted to go back to the profitability for the rest of 2014 and make sure I understand the puts and takes. Should I think about this lower margin improvement relative to what you posted in Q1 as driven really by 3 things: More difficult Energy & Transport comps; fairly good-sized headwind from higher incentive comp; and then fading headcount benefit. Are those the 3 main things?","Michael I. DeWalt","No, I wouldn't say -- no, I don't think so. I don't think Energy & Transportation is going to be materially different probably than the first quarter. So what we're thinking about here, Andy, is that second -- or the last 9 months of the year versus the first quarter. I think the way to think about it is we usually have seasonally low costs in the first quarter. We would approve programs that our units can spend money on during the year. But it usually takes a little time for that to ramp up. So first quarter is usually light on costs, fourth quarter is usually a little heavy. So we would see program-related costs going up. Incentive comp that you mentioned is up year-over-year, but we have that in the first quarter, too, so I don't think -- there's not a material -- there's no difference really between the first quarter and the rest of the year for that. Depreciation usually kind of ramps up as we go through the year. As we put capital in place, it goes up. We have things like our annual merit plan is effective April 1, so we get a bit of a bump up in labor costs, usually from Q2 on. I think another point, and Brad mentioned this earlier, and that is margins in Construction Industries, I think relative to the first quarter, Construction Industry mix is going to probably get a little bit worse. More of the rest of the year, we would have smaller product. We expect some rental reload to occur kind of over the course of the year, more than we had in the first quarter. First quarter was a little more excavation-focused, particularly in China. So probably a little bit of a declining mix in Construction as we go through the year. And then for Resource Industries, there are programs that we cut last year. Things that we really want to do for the long term. Engineering around getting our components. And what was Bucyrus product, getting all the hundreds of thousands of part numbers into our systems for aftermarket. That all requires some spending. We delayed it last year. And as we go through the course of this year, those are programs that we want to spend money on. They're the right thing to do for the long term. The rest of our business is pretty stable, and we kind of need to get to it. So I think those are the kinds of things that caused profit over the course of the last 3 months of the year to be maybe a bit below the first quarter.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if we go back -- thanks for the clarity but it makes me a little more cloudy in my thinking about how to get to the Q4 being the highest of the last 3 quarters. Is there anything unusual that you're building into the -- that quarterly comment? I'm wondering if there's any...","Michael I. DeWalt","No, no. The fourth quarter for us usually is a big sales quarter. It's usually right up there with -- sometimes, the second quarter can be higher than it. But in general, the fourth quarter is usually seasonally a pretty high quarter. The third quarter and the first quarter are usually the weakest. So of the last 3, the third quarter would be the weakest. And we think the second quarter is probably close to, but a little bit below the average of the 3. We don't really have anything unique, any big, strange expenses. I'm -- when I talk about these numbers, by the way, I'm excluding restructuring costs because the timing of that could have a different effect. And of course, that's why we pulled it out. But no, we don't have anything that, off the top of my head, that I can think of that's going to be odd about any quarter. I mean, it might turn out to be that way, but certainly, we're not planning it that way.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","JPMorgan. Actually my first question is for Doug if he's still in the room. Doug, it was interesting to me that you mentioned Ukraine, Russia and also China as potentially headwinds. But you didn't mention Latin America, and in particular, Brazil. Are you not concerned about the macro environment in Brazil or is that something you've been planning for all year, and so incrementally, it's not getting any worse than you might have anticipated?","Douglas R. Oberhelman","I would put Brazil macroeconomic as one or macro situation as one of those we would be watching. I would not put it in the same category as the others that I talked about: China, Ukraine, and maybe a couple of others in the Middle East at all. We've got a pretty stable business across Latin America. Brazil's got some projects that are coming in that we -- doing some things around infrastructure this year, next year and the year after that ought to help that. But the overall macro situation there is one to watch, frankly.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, the color. And then can you -- one of you talked about -- where does Tier 4 pricing show up in your numbers? Is that in the pricing bucket or is that not included because it's separate pricing? I'm just trying to get a sense of net pricing, are you giving away the Tier 4 costs, and is that impacting margins or are Tier 4 prices being passed through but not incorporated into pricing? If you could just give us some color on what's going on with Tier 4 pricing and whether you're actually giving pricing?","Michael I. DeWalt","Yes. So it's not included in our price realization bucket, in our kind of a waterfall chart and release. And it's because the content is different. If you're going to add, for example, say, after treatment, and you're going to raise the price for that, there are kind of 2 ways that you could deal with that. You could say, hey, I have a price increase and have a cost increase. We think that's kind of -- distorts what's really going on. The content of the machine is changing, it's a different machine. So the way we deal with it is, we net the content cost changes with the specific, in this case, Tier 4 related price changes. And we would just show the net of the 2 in the price realization number. I think as a generic comment, I would say we're not giving away Tier 4. I think it's been a pretty successful introduction of the price increases that have gone in for Tier 4. Generically, we're meant to cover the additional costs and reasonable margin. And I think, by and large, that's happening.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Ross Gilardi.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Bank of America. I just had a couple of questions. From your backlog commentary, it sounds like Power Systems backlog is up fairly sharply due to locomotives. In the rest of your press -- other parts of your press release, you mentioned that well service activity is picking up. You don't sound worried about oil and gas CapEx, natural gas prices have rebounded. Why aren't you raising your Power Systems outlook today?","Michael I. DeWalt","Well, a lot of those things we had in our original outlook. I think we were probably -- maybe in January, what we were seeing in terms of quoting activity, deals in place with customers, our expectations haven't really changed all that much as a result of this. So I think we were reasonably positive on that sector all along.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you, Mike. And then could you comment a little bit more about recent order activity in oil and gas? And maybe give some color on what your exposure is to subsea drilling, which seems to be sort of the weaker spot for a lot of your peers?","Michael I. DeWalt","Yes. I guess I would be careful of how I say this. For our oil and gas business, particularly for resets, order activity has been pretty strong. It looks like the well servicing is starting to pick back up a little bit, and that's a good thing. In terms of deep-sea drilling, I would say, in the scheme of our overall oil and gas business, that's pretty minor.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Mig Dobre.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Robert W. Baird & Co. If we can, guys, going back to Brazil in Construction. Latin American revenue was slightly down this quarter. Can you maybe talk a little bit about dealer inventory levels in Latin America? Maybe also your view on fundamental demand through the year, excluding this large government order that you got from Brazil?","Michael I. DeWalt","Yes. Dealer inventory, I think most places in the world, with a few minor product exceptions, is in pretty good shape. I mean, dealers worked on adjusting dealer inventory to current demand really over the past 1.5 years. And so I don't -- I can't see any reason that looks out of line. Now you might be able to get to a country or a dealer and maybe draw a different conclusion. But I think by overall and by region, it's not sort of out of whack with selling these. Your comment on demand in Brazil is a little bit hard to answer because, if last year, related to this, these large orders that we had that Doug mentioned a minute ago, because we had them last year. This year, the amount related that we're going to sell related to those big orders, I think, is going to be a bit less than last year. So far this year, Brazil has actually been reasonably good for us. Most of the other countries in Latin America have been down a little bit. Brazil has kind of held up for us. And I think this big order, these large orders that we're getting from the government certainly helped that. But we've had them in both years, last year and this year.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a quick modeling question. On the corporate expense line, there's a lot of moving pieces there with incentive comp, LIFO, legal settlements last year, can you give us some maybe color or guidance as to how you expect this line item to move through the year?","Michael I. DeWalt","Yes. That's a tough one because I think the big variable for that will be the timing of the restructuring costs. That's probably the biggest variable. And then as you go forward, if there happens to be changes, if the outlook from here goes up or goes down, that can have an impact on the corporate, some of the corporate incentive comp. Based on the outlook where it's at now, we would think that to be pretty stable. So probably, the biggest variation going forward there is likely to be restructuring costs.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's Barclays. So Mike, your cash flow generation in the quarter was strong, as you said. Some of it was obviously net income growth, but can you talk about the increased focus it seems that you have on keeping working capital down or any other changes you've made to generate more cash? And is this level of cash sustainable, is this pace sustainable going forward? And then how should we think about buybacks in the subsequent quarters? I know you'll tell me you'll be opportunistic, but it seems like you've shifted your focus that way at least little bit.","Bradley M. Halverson","Yes. Andy, this is Brad Halverson. I can start. And so I think on the cash flow side, it\u2019s another positive story for us that we're extremely happy with. We finished the end of '13, I think, with a debt-to-cap at 29.7%. We did complete the buyback of the $1.7 billion, and we had some incentive pay expense. Even with all that, we're going to finish debt-to-cap at 30.2% at the end of the first quarter with $5 billion in cash. And we have been steadily working on our working capital management. We've made great progress, I think, in all areas. The one that I think remains the biggest opportunity for us will remain in the inventory turn area where we talked about a little bit in CONEXPO. If you look out a few years, we still see continued improvement there. And so our cash flow situation is very good. Our priorities remain the same. And the credit rating, mid A, is in good shape with our position. We're continuing to fund growth and push for organic growth. We don't see anything big. Pension plan, well-funded, we only have $200 million of required contributions the rest of the year. We will make our normal dividend decision in June to the board and announce that at that time. But our history of dividends will remain kind of consistent with our approach there. And you're right, stock repurchase will be opportunistic. But I can tell you what we will do is, when we get to that decision time, we look out a couple of years and we'll model a couple of years of trough and look at what our balance sheet strength would be. But at this point in time, Andy, yes, I would say we continue to be positive about our ability to generate cash out in the rest of the year and in the next 3 to 4 years, and we're in great shape.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful, Brad. And then if I just -- if I could ask you guys to step back and maybe talk about U.S. and European nonresidential construction. I mean, we've heard a lot of mixed sort of feedback this quarter. I think a lot of people were positive at CONEXPO. Your results look good, but maybe just commentary on how you see that market unfolding here this year and beyond?","Michael I. DeWalt","Sorry, I was -- I missed that question, Andy, I was saying something to Doug here.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No worries. So just on U.S. and European nonres or commercial construction, a lot of mixed feedback we get on that topic. And people were pretty positive on it at CONEXPO. Your numbers look good, but maybe just commentary on the overall market.","Michael I. DeWalt","Yes. I mean, you get -- it seems like you get mixed messages almost every day on housing. One day, it's -- prices are up, there's -- and it's a hot market. And then the day after that, you get sales of existing homes down. But if you look at the fine print of those because one of the comments is, there's not enough supply. So I think our view of housing is that it will continue, particularly for starts, kind of continue to get better. We think this year is going to be over 1 million. So I think we're pretty constructive on -- at least for the U.S. housing, I mean. But again, you've got to put that in perspective. It's still way below where it was 6 years ago, 7 years ago. So getting better, but not great. Europe has been -- I don't think I can give you a separate comment on res versus nonres there. But it has been steady positive for us over the course of the quarter. Whether that will keep up, I think depends a lot on kind of confidence there and kind of, is this economic growth starting to get a little bit better, does it continue? Because one thing you've got to remember about our business, and that is, most of what we sell at any given quarter is to replace something that's worn out. And what customers are -- it's not -- certainly, at this point, in those markets, it's not about increasing the capacity of the installed base. It's about replacing things that need to be replaced. And what you need is business confidence, reasonable results from construction activity, interest rates that are supportive, and we kind of have those things. So I'd say, we remain reasonably constructive on construction for the developed world. And you're right, the number for the first quarter kind of pan that out.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from David Raso.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","ISI. Just wanted to figure out the EPS progression the rest of the year. It seems like you're implying second quarter EPS is below 1Q and really that's only happened once in the last 20 years and that's the quarter when you were trying to absorb Bucyrus initially. So I'm just trying to figure out, are you being conservative or maybe I need to figure out more about the sales mix help in the first quarter for Construction, so I can more understand why the margins need to come down in Construction and\/or do you feel that Resource Industries margins have bottomed yet? So I'm just trying to understand why we're down sequentially in 2Q.","Michael I. DeWalt","Yes. I think a couple of things. One, even in Resource Industries, it's our intention to increase spending on programs that we really need to do for the long term. I kind of talked about those a little bit. So I think if you look at our level of spending on programs in the first quarter, it was extraordinary -- it's usually seasonally light and it was probably even more so in the first quarter this year. Now we had a rough year last year. And I'll tell you, we came into the year with the management team with a lot of caution. We were purposely trying to push as much of the program spending out that we had allowed in the plan and was in our outlook beyond the first quarter. We wanted to get part of the year under our belt to see how it was actually going to turn out before we started up some of the programs. So we have been cautious with the management team early on the timing of expense for this year. So I think we benefited by that in the first quarter, and we'll see some cost increase for things, again, that we need to do that will come later in the year. For Construction, I think there will be some margin decline. The first quarter was heavier on excavation and earthmoving. The rest of the year, proportionately, will be a bit more of the smaller BCP product. I think we expect some more rental-loading as we go through the year and that will be a little bit negative to mix, so we think that will be the case as well. So it'd be great if it was better than that. We would certainly like that, but I think our outlook for the year is kind of our reasonable and prudent view today of how it looks.","Okay.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Mike DeWalt","Thank you very much and good morning and welcome everyone to our year-end earnings call. I\u2019m Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar\u2019s Corporate Controller and Director of Investor Relations. On the call today, I\u2019m pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.","This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you would like a copy of today\u2019s call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website, and it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","This morning we\u2019ll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1-A, Risk Factors, of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC back on February 21 of 2012, and also in the forward-looking statements language contained in today\u2019s release. In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in our financial release and that\u2019s been posted on our website at caterpillar.com.","Okay. This morning before we get into the Q&A, I\u2019m going to cover four topics. The first will be a short summary of the full-year of 2012; then I\u2019ll take a few minutes to discuss how we ended the year compared with what we expected in our outlook for 2012 that we issued back in October. Our third topic will be a comparison of the fourth quarter of 2012 with the fourth quarter of 2011, and then I\u2019ll finish-up with my final topic which is a discussion about our 2013 outlook. Then I\u2019ll turn the floor over to Doug Oberhelman, and Doug will take a few minutes to talk about our Siwei acquisition.","All right, lets get started with 2012, and we were very pleased there was report this morning that it was another record year for both sales and revenues and profit. Sales and revenues were $65.9 billion and that was an increase of 10% from 2011. Profit was $8.48 a share and that was up 15%. Now the $8.48 per share for the year did include the goodwill impairment charge of $580 million or $0.87 a share and we announced that back on January 18. At $65.9 billion sales and revenues were lower than we expected when we were at this point about a year ago in January 2011 with our first outlook.","After a great first half the economies around the world began to slow around mid-year, and as a result dealer sales to end users began to flatten out. We found ourselves with inventory that was too high and dealers also found themselves with too much inventory. As a result dealers slowed orders, and in the third quarter we began the process of scaling back production. Now while production declined somewhat in the third quarter, we took it down much more in the fourth quarter, and because of that we were able to reduce inventory in the fourth quarter by $2 billion, far surpassing our goal of reducing inventory by about $1 billion.","Now in addition to the $2 billion that we took out in the fourth quarter, dealers also reduced inventory by about $600 million in the quarter. So, in combination with our inventory and dealer machine inventory a total of $2.6 billion came out in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s a lot of inventory coming out in one quarter, and it was certainly a negative for sales, efficiency and the impact of cost absorption.","Now turning back to the full year from an operational standpoint, 2012 was a good year. We've been providing a table near the back of our financial release each quarter this year highlighting our incremental operating profit pull through. Now when we show that, we try to make it apples-to-apples and to do that we've been adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. And on that basis, our full year incremental operating income was 43% of incremental sales and revenues.","Now that 43% was helped by currency impacts over the course of 2012 and excluding those items, it was 33% still much better than our goal of about 25%. Now in addition to operating income, we continue to improve quality, safety measures and our sales improved faster than the overall machine industry in general.Finally in response to the weaker economic climate we found during the second half of the year, we've slowed down capital spending. Our CapEx for 2012 was about 3.4 billion and that's over $0.5 billion under our original expectations for 2012. Okay, that's a quick review of 2012. Let's move on to the second topic and that's how we did versus the outlook we've provided last October.Last October, we were expecting 2012 sales and revenues to come in at about 66 billion and with actual sales and revenues of 65.9 billion; we were right about on what we thought. Our outlook for profit at that time was a range of $9 to $9.25 with a midpoint of $9.13. We ended the year at $9.48, so we missed the outlook.There were two large items that we didn't anticipate in the outlook; one negative and one positive. The negative item was the 580 million or $0.87 a share goodwill impairment related to Siwei. The positive item was the settlement of U.S. tax returns and that was a 300 million or $0.45 per share positive.Excluding those two large items, again neither of which was anticipated in our outlook, profit was $0.10 per share lower than the bottom of our range and about $0.23 per share below the middle of the range. About two-thirds of the difference from the $9.13 midpoint was the cost impact from the more substantial production and inventory cuts in the fourth quarter. Most of the remaining difference was from currency translation losses reported in the other income and expense lines below operating profit and that was related to the euro primarily.While the scale of production and inventory reduction was certainly negative to efficiency and profit, we're pleased with what we achieved in terms of inventory reduction. It's been a major focus throughout the company over the last couple of quarters and it was an exceptional result.Okay, let me move on to my third topic this morning and that's the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter a year ago. Sales and revenues of 16.1 billion or about 1.2 billion or 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2011. While there were certainly pluses and minuses, the most significant factor in the sale change was the inventory. The others add about 800 million to inventories in the fourth quarter of '11, which was positive for sales back then and in the fourth quarter of '12, they reduced their machine inventories about 600 million and that was a negative.In total then, the impact on sales of dealer inventory changes was about 1.4 billion and that was more than the total change in our top line. Our profit per share in the quarter was $1.04 and that's lower than the $2.32 per share that we reported in the fourth quarter of 2011 by about $1.28.As with the full year numbers, the Siwei goodwill impairment was negative $0.87 a share and the tax settlement was positive $0.45. Other unfavorable factors in order of importance were manufacturing costs and they were unfavorable 417 million and that was primarily a result of the significant impacts of the decline in production in the fourth quarter and the $2 billion inventory reduction.Sales volume was negative 371 million. Tax impacts and this is excluding the 300 million positive item were unfavorable $0.36 a share. We had a higher tax rate and absence of favorable items from a year-ago. Other income and expense, again which is below operating profit was negative $136 million. And that\u2019s essentially the absence of currency gains a year-ago versus losses in the fourth quarter of \u201912.Now, one positive factor that partially offset those negative items was price utilization and that was a positive for the quarter. Now on our \u2013 in our release today on page 6 we have a waterfall chart that goes through the changes in operating income and that can provide a little more detail.All right, that\u2019s the fourth quarter, my final topic this morning here is the outlook for 2013. We will start with economics. And from that standpoint we do see conditions improving and expect world economic growth of at least 2.5% in 2013 and that would be a small improvement from our estimate of about 6.3% for 2012. I think the key phrase here when we talk about the world economy in 2013 is a bit better, but still weak.In the United States we\u2019re becoming increasingly optimistic. The feds interest rate policies and their plan that continue injecting liquidity are in our view positive for 2013 growth. We are expecting the U.S. economy to grow at least 2.5% in 2013. Now that\u2019s now when any of us would consider a robust level of growth, but it\u2019s certainly than what we saw \u2013 better than what we saw in the second half of 2012.We expect the U.S. housing industry to help the economy in 2013 and we\u2019ve all seen the positive news items related to housing over the past few months. In Europe we\u2019re expecting another tough year for growth. The problems in Europe are well known and much of the region is entrenched in fiscal austerity. As a result, we expect growth in the eurozone to struggle to match 2012 and we expect that construction activity there will decline.One more positive about the prospectus for the developing economies around the world, in many countries they\u2019ve been easing policy and lowering rates for more than a year and average rates today are close to levels that were last reached during the financial crisis. So, we expect that contributes to better growth in \u201913. Specifically in China, we\u2019re expecting improvement in 2013. In response to the 2012 slowdown, the Chinese government did accelerate its credit growth in infrastructure spending and as a result the economic data that we\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter has begun to improve.Our outlook assumes that Chinese government will maintain pro-growth policies throughout 2013, and we\u2019re expecting the economic growth in China to be near 8.5%, a more favorable environment for construction and higher commodity demand. Okay, that\u2019s a quick look at our economic view. Let\u2019s turn to sales and revenues.We\u2019re expecting sales and revenues to be in a range of $60 billion to $68 billion reflecting both upside and downside potential from 2012. We\u2019re increasingly optimistic that there may be potential for better growth ahead, but we remain cautious about how quickly that improvement in going to translate into higher sales for Cat. At the $64 billion middle of that outlook range, we\u2019re expecting overall end-user demand to be relatively flat with 2012. We do expect pluses and minuses by segment and I\u2019ll cover that in a minute, but overall demand relatively flat. At the mid-point of the outlook though we do have $2 billion decline in sales and revenues from 2012, and that\u2019s primarily a result of dealer inventory changes.Over the course of 2012, dealers added about $1 billion to their inventories and in \u201913 our expectation is that dealers will reduce inventory by well over $1 billion, so the net of that is an unfavorable impact on sales of over $2 billion. By segment we expect sales in resource industries which is mostly mining to decline. As we said last October, mining customers have been lowering their CapEx expectations for 2013 and order levels have been very weak since the middle of 2012.Another sales negative next year is going to be in our all other segment. In terms of sales is very small and we usually don\u2019t have much to say about it, but over the first-half of the year we expect it to be about $400 million lower than in sales and revenues from the first half of 2012 and that's due to the absence of sales from our third-party logistics business which we sold in July of 2012.We expect sales in our Power Systems segment to be relatively flat with 2012. And on the positive side, we expect that Construction Industry sales will be flat to up in 2013 with improving end-user demand.In summary on sales, at the middle of our outlook range, dealer inventory changes are driving the most significant piece of the reduction in sales. For profit, we're expecting a range of $7 to $9 a share. Profit in 2012 with $8.48. So at the middle of the range, we have profit declining $0.48 a share.Negative items include absence of the tax settlement that was 300 million in the fourth quarter, absence of about a roughly $275 million gain from the third quarter related to the sale of our third-party logistics business. The 2 billion decline in sales with higher depreciation.Now if you look at costs and price realization together excluding depreciation, so price net of cost, we would expect that to be overall relatively neutral next year. We do have a big positive item and that's absence of the $0.87 per share impairment charge that we recorded in the fourth quarter.Now my final point here on the outlook is really about the first quarter, and while we're not providing specific sales and profit outlook for the quarter, we are expecting that sales and revenues are likely to be significantly lower in the first quarter of 2012. Now to put it in perspective, let's think about the full year. At the middle of our outlook range, we expect sales and revenues to be down about 2 billion for the year and it looks like all or more of that 2 billion is likely to be in the first quarter. And that's the result of further reductions in production from the fourth quarter and we and our dealers continue to work down. As a result, profit is also expected to be significantly lower than the first quarter of 2012, again a result of the lower sales and some negative cost impact from continuing to reduce production and take out inventory. Okay, that's my review.With that, I'll turn the floor over to Doug.Douglas R. OberhelmanAll right, thank you Mike and good morning everyone. It's Doug Oberhelman. I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about the $580 million impairment charge that we announced on January 18 related to our acquisition of Siwei and I'll start by going over some background.Siwei's a company located in China and they make hydraulic roof supports that are used in underground coal mining. China is the world's largest coal producer and the vast majority of it is mined underground. The acquisition of Siwei is a starting point for Caterpillar entering into the Chinese underground coal business.We've completed the acquisition in June 2012 and in about that time, as we do with Caterpillar, we moved experienced Cat people into our newly acquired company to start the process of bringing Siwei into the Caterpillar family. In the fall, we started a physical inventory and reconciled or I should say attempted to reconcile the physical inventory with the books.Our newly appointed team with Siwei found a substantial discrepancy which led to our investigation. What we discovered was deliberate multiyear coordinated accounting misconduct at Siwei. It was executed by several senior managers at Siwei for the purpose of inflating sales, understating costs and over-reporting profit and it included fabricated documentation designed to cover their tracks.In light of this new information, we had to take a goodwill impairment charge which was included in our fourth quarter results that we reported this morning. The conduct we discovered does not represent in any way, shape or form the way Caterpillar does business or how we expect our employees to work. As a result, we moved quickly and decisively to hold responsible the leaders that were directly accountable for the wrongdoing and we've changed the leadership at Siwei.Because this happened at an acquisition we made in China, it's raised questions in the media about our strategy in China and I'd like to address that. China is the largest country in the world by population. It's developing rapidly and it's one of the fastest growing large economies in the world. It\u2019s already the world\u2019s largest market for construction equipment and has a large mining industry. It\u2019s a very important market now and as we look to the future, we expect it to become even more significant.","While the industries we serve in China are significant, it doesn\u2019t mean there are challenges. The construction industry in China had a tough year in 2012 as in other countries the construction and mining industries in China are subject to changes in the overall economy and over time move with the business cycle. You don\u2019t have to look any further than U.S. housing to see that cyclicality happens in countries other than China.Our strategy in China has served around bringing our products, services, support capability, manufacturing scale, supplier development, procurement, product development and distribution to China for the long-term. That will continue. The impairment at Siwei doesn\u2019t change there. China is the world\u2019s leading coal producer and the products we make at Siwei are important for that industry. We will develop and improve those products for use in China and for export and we intend to add more products to better serve the Chinese coal mining industry.While we look at Siwei, we felt we could make improvements with Caterpillar\u2019s experience and people and given our strategic imperatives, this deal make sense. In fact, we\u2019ve already made good progress on significantly lowering Siwei\u2019s most significant cost driver, steel. The ability to lower steel cost is just one example of leveraging Caterpillar scale and global network to improve Siwei\u2019s operation.Our announcement of the accounting misconduct in impairment is something that no CEO wants to make. Its disappointing, one we better not have had to deal with, but when faced with challenges like this, it\u2019s how we respond that defines us. We talk a lot about accountability at Caterpillar and I sure have preached that here in the last three years as CEO. I recognize the decision to acquire Siwei happened on my watch and the buck stops at my desk. I\u2019m accountable for that acquisition.There has been a tremendous amount of time, energy, and resources dedicated to this investigation up to this point and we\u2019re not done. We\u2019re putting in more effort to finish our investigation as we do with processes and products at Caterpillar we\u2019re constantly looking for improvement. We will imply what we learn from this as we go forward.One final point, we were deliberately misled by the accounting misconduct at Siwei and we're considering all options to recover our losses and hold those responsible accountable for their wrongdoing. Related to that we have a long standing policy not to comment on pending or contemplated litigation and further comment is not appropriate at this time. That means we won't be going into more detail on this subject when we take your questions about 2012 results and the \u201913 outlook. With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to, Mike.Mike DeWaltOkay, thanks Doug. With that we\u2019re ready to go into Q&A, please.Question-and-Answer Session","OperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.David Raso - ISI GroupHi, ISI. For 2013, the sales mid-point, if we strip-out cap financial we\u2019re speaking about $61 billion. So, that said, a question on the Company inventory. Your Company inventory is a percent of trailing sales looking at the equipment company just came down from over 27% of trailing sale to now below 25%. So, when we think about 2013 and the target for Company inventory, are we comfortable with that 25% level? I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for how much more Company inventory do you expect to take out in 2013?Mike DeWaltYeah, good question David, and honestly we don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t track it as a percent of sales. What we\u2019re targeting is inventory returns which is essentially related to cost of sales not so much sales although of course they\u2019re tied together. I think to a large degree where -- in terms of dollars where we end up on inventory, at the end of 2013 will kind of depend to some degree on where we're at in terms of the outlook if we're at the bottom of the outlook or the top of the outlook. I suspect that the inventory number will look different. If you just start with where we are today in terms of inventory, there's more to come out in the first quarter. I certainly don't think it will be on the scale. We're not predicting it will be on the scale of what came out in the fourth quarter $2 billion, but certainly there is more coming out in the first quarter so it's going to come down from here.David Raso - ISI GroupBut at the midpoint, do we feel there's more inventory to come out?Douglas R. OberhelmanYes.David Raso - ISI GroupOkay. And then related to that, the guidance by segment if I look at Construction Industries, you said flat to up slowly and you used 3% Power flat. I assume all other pull-out Cat logistics and this small number call it flat after you pull that Cat logistics out. It would seem to be implying Resource Industries is down, call it 10%, 11%, 12% on revenues for the year. Is that a fair characterization how you're looking at Resource Industries and how do we square that revenue guidance up with the orders for the equipment have been down more than that the last two quarters?Douglas R. OberhelmanYeah, a couple of things. One, we gave general direction on the segments and I think the way you've described it in terms of general direction is absolutely correct. Resource Industries is going to have again other than absent the logistics really all the decline. How that squares up with orders, we're starting the year with actually a reasonable backlog for the big product but we do need to take \u2013 we need to take on more orders over the course of the next maybe two quarters to make the forecast. So it's not a case where orders can stay at the level that they have been during the second half of '12. So it will need to go up. But it looks to us like the bottom is actually the third and the fourth quarter of last year. We've already seen pretty substantial pickup in construction orders in the fourth quarter. Most of the decline in orders that we saw I think in 2012 and the second half of the year on construction was related to dealers wanting to take out inventory. Hope that helps. David, we probably need to move on to the next person on the line.David Raso - ISI GroupAll right, thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich [Goldman Sachs]. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman SachsHi, good morning. It's Goldman Sachs. My two questions are on the pricing outlook. Mike, first, how would you characterize the pricing environment on your Resource Industries bookings today compared to what you're shipping out of backlog? Do you expect positive price realization out of that business? And second, does the pricing outlook include any benefit for your Construction Equipment business from the next export position out of Japan given the recent movement that you had? Thank you.Mike DeWaltOkay, that's a real mouthful, Jerry. I think in general I would say we're cautious on the pricing next year. Our outlook reflects something around 1%. We did better than that in 2012. I think we were actually a bit surprised as we went through the year at how well pricing held up. We don't have a big difference looking forward to next year between the segments. We have small improvements baked into each of them, nothing big. I think given another year of relative weakness in the global economy, I mean my goodness, 2.5% is nothing to jump up and down about in the world economy, it's pretty weak. I think we're sounding a fairly cautious tone on pricing but by the same token we're not trying to be alarmist here. It's not as though you have big cuts anyway, it's just weak economic growth and caution on our part.Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman SachsThank you.Douglas R. OberhelmanI would like to add to that, Mike, just a little bit on kind of our business model and strategy and we are really working on market share to build population around the world to make sure that that cedes our business model. And that plays also into the kind of pricing philosophy we had because we're trying to juggle that much better as we go after an increasing field population which then drives our aftermarket, drives our dealers, as you all know. So that plays into that equation as well.Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman SachsThank you.Mike DeWaltThanks, Jerry. Next question please.OperatorThank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.Jamie Cook - Credit SuisseHi, good morning. Credit Suisse. Just wanted to dig a little deeper into, how you guys are thinking about the backlog and in particular mining backlog order of trends, I guess, Mike at what point do you expect to see a stabilization or improvement in orders within mining\u2019s and which areas are you guys most optimistic or pessimistic on, because I guess when I think about your stock, the overhangs being mining, I\u2019m sorry, its been inventory which you\u2019re working through, mining is the next one because we\u2019re just trying to get a feel can Cat, if you look at Cat 2013 is a transition year, can Cat grow their earnings in 2014 on just construction if mining continues to deteriorate and I will get back in queue after that.Mike DeWaltOkay. Well, in terms of 2014, of course we\u2019d like to get through 2013 first.Jamie Cook - Credit SuisseI know, but you did lay out 2015 long-term target, so \u2026Mike DeWaltOn mining again, we had massive orders, I mean very large orders in mining throughout much of a \u201911 and really through almost the entire first half of \u201912. That\u2019s when sentiment changed I think in the world economy it was evident, in China it was softer, you had an easing of commodity demand, although, overall mining activity actually did go up in \u201912. So, orders on hand were quite significant and over the past six months customers have really eased off on ordering. It did started to pick up a little bit late in the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s certainly not what we\u2019d consider to be at a sustainable level, that means to go up from here. But right now we have good availability, so when the order rate start to move back up a bit, we will certainly be in a position where we can take care of the customers. For \u2013 again for the large product, we don\u2019t have certainly 100% coverage for 2013, so we didn\u2019t need to take in orders both for kind of filling up year in 2013 and for 2014. So, I think we would want to see some continued improvement in order rates, really between now and mid-year, let\u2019s make that happen.Jamie Cook - Credit SuisseAnd Mike, can you just say, you said it picked up a little in the fourth \u2013 late in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about which area specifically within mining that you saw that? Geographically by commodity, however you wish to?Mike DeWaltNo, no, and partly because it's relatively small, I mean, I\u2019m not trying to make a big deal about it. We went from \u2013 let\u2019s say, very low to low. So, it's still below where we need it to be.Jamie Cook - Credit SuisseOkay.Douglas R. OberhelmanI would just add Mike that we did add a slightly firmer price forecast for iron ore, in copper you saw that in our outlook statement. If that happens, of course that will help the order rates as the miners respond to that. A lot of which is dependent on world growth as it goes through the year as well, and if that would be above our 2.5% rate on a global basis we probably would expect that go up, but if it's lower we\u2019d probably not see it come back as fast. So, there\u2019s really a high correlation there, but we did put out $135 ore price. So, we\u2019ll see how that goes throughout the year.Jamie Cook - Credit SuisseOkay. Thanks.OperatorThank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.Seth Weber - RBC Capital MarketsHey, good morning, it's RBC. A couple of clarifications just to start, the fourth quarter pickup in construction equipment orders that you sighted Mike, I mean, is that just typical a seasonality or can you talk about how that\u2019s turning year-over-year?Mike DeWaltYeah. No, I think in some ways I think that the year-over-year trend at least if we\u2019re looking at order rates for construction have more to do with dealer inventory than actual demand levels. I think it's a case where \u2013 think about it, if you\u2019re a dealer and you want to lower inventories, the way you do that is you lower order rates below what you\u2019re selling and then we ship you less and then you lower your inventory. So, that\u2019s what happens really beginning in the third quarter. Construction orders were very weak in the third quarter and that means our production levels in the fourth quarter went down and dealers cut out inventory. So, the order level is always -- order of magnitude, three, four months ahead of where our production levels are. So, what that means is, so I think that pick-up that we saw in the fourth quarter probably has more to do with dealers seeing the light at the end of the tunnel on inventory reduction.Seth Weber - RBC Capital MarketsOkay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then on the inventory reduction that you saw this quarter, was the Siwei adjustment, did that contribute to the inventory reduction that you booked?Mike DeWaltNo. I mean virtually not at all. I mean not at zero but it's so small that it'd be less than rounding.Seth Weber - RBC Capital MarketsOkay. And then if I could ask another question just on the mining space, the slowdown that you're seeing or the cancellations, is that related -- is that still related to primarily growth projects or are you starting to see the mining companies scale back on sort of more maintenance type stuff?Mike DeWaltYeah and I think if you were to judge it by order levels, they've cut back on capital spending across the board.Seth Weber - RBC Capital MarketsSo, including maintenance type stuff?Mike DeWaltYeah, I mean order rates over the last six months in mining have been very low. I mean if you think about it, at about midyear, we have a very large backlog as a result of the year and a half of very high orders. And really for the last half of 2012, they essentially took a break from ordering and it was pretty much across the board. I wouldn't pick necessarily on one commodity versus the next or one type of project versus the next.Seth Weber - RBC Capital MarketsOkay. Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. Our next question today is coming from Theoni Pilarinos [Raymond James]. Please note your affiliation and pose your question.Theoni Pilarinos - Raymond JamesGood morning. Raymond James. I'm just reading through your outlook section and I see a lot of bullish points that you have a higher housing starts, PMI, commodity prices going up, pro-growth policies. So I'm just wondering why you have such a wide guidance range and what's really baked into that $7 number?Bradley M. HalversonYeah, this is Brad Halverson. I think if you look at our range, we've been down this path before. We do see some positive news as we've mentioned in our release. North America is getting stronger. At Cat Financial, we've finished the fourth quarter strong with retail financing up and frankly past dues at the lowest level they've been since 2007. But if you look at the last two years, we've been in this path with good momentum in the first half of the year, fiscal cliff issues, debt ceiling issues, election issues, China is slowing down and so in our industry we're prepared for both sides and that's why we have a wide range. And I think when we get through the first quarter, we're going to know a lot better but internally we're planned for both sides and we surely hope to see the high side of our outlook and another record year for sales and profit.Theoni Pilarinos - Raymond JamesOkay, great. And a follow-up question. You talked about your construction orders picking up at the end of the fourth quarter. Where do we see that in your dealer stats [indiscernible]?Mike DeWaltTheoni, you were cutting out. Could you restate that?Theoni Pilarinos - Raymond JamesYeah, sorry. You mentioned that there was a pickup in orders in the back half of the -- at the very end of the fourth quarter. And I'm just wondering where do we see that in your dealer stats? From what I saw, they were declining.Mike DeWaltDealer stats are what they're selling not what they're ordering.Theoni Pilarinos - Raymond JamesSorry. You said there was a pickup in demand rather, and so the dealer stats indicate demand was declining in December. Am I correct there?Mike DeWaltIf I said demand, what I meant to say was that for construction in particular, orders later in the fourth quarter picked up. Again, that's what they're ordering, that's not what they're selling.Theoni Pilarinos - Raymond JamesOkay, thank you.Mike DeWaltBut I will make a comment on the retail dealer statistics that came out last Friday and it was a little weaker than it had been. I mean we were in the range over the last few months about 5% or 6% and in December, it was down to 1%. And I think there are two reasons for that or two \u2013 I'm sure there are definitely many more but the two that stand out are in the fourth quarter last year, we had just a very, very large pickup between November and December in North America, up more than 50% in one month. And I think a lot of that or some of that anyway had to do with the bonus appreciation that was expiring at the end of last year, so I think that helped out dealer sales a bit in the fourth quarter of last year. So I think between that and coal mining sales being down a bit, that in December, that really amounts I think for most of the decline.Thanks, Theoni. Next question, please.OperatorThank you. Our next question today is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research PartnersIt\u2019s Vertical Research Partners. Good morning.Douglas R. OberhelmanHi, Rob.Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research PartnersMy first question is on mining, it seems as though you have a little bit of mining inventory at dealers, which I don\u2019t think is typical although an in-transit assembly and so are you able to quantify that or comment on it? And the related question to that is, it seems as though despite all the noise on mining CapEx and there is clearly cancellations and push outs in a more cautious atmosphere, it seems as though the top 10 or 15 miners are only spending down 10 or 15 \u2013 5% or 10%, excuse me, in \u201913 versus \u201912, the order sound a lot worse than that. So, I guess, there is a question, did the Company\u2019s over order and there is lot of inventory sloshing around either on mine sites or at dealers and at the normal level is actually based on CapEx as it stands now is higher than now or not? So, it\u2019s how do you feel like orders at\/or are versus mining global CapEx?Douglas R. OberhelmanWell, there is a lot wrapped up into that Rob. But I think there are a couple of differences between order rates and mining CapEx. First off, I mean, we come into the year still with for the large products in particular, reasonable order backlog. So, that is reflective of that plus whatever new orders we take in, what we\u2019re actually going to sell. What\u2019s happened and those dealers have low or \u2013 dealers and customers have order \u2013 mining orders over the last six months, a bit of that\u2019s come out of the backlog. So I think there is a little bit of the difference because of that. Your point on dealer inventory is also actually a good one. We don\u2019t usually have dealer inventory in that normal way you would think about it where we ship, a bunch of trucks to a dealer, they put them together and set them on the lot and wait for a customer to come by. It doesn\u2019t normally happen that way. But we do have substantial dealer inventory and that\u2019s essentially a pipeline.Now with activity levels, with sales levels coming down, that we\u2019d expect a part of the decline in dealer inventory actually quite a bit of it next year to be related to mining. So what that means is what the miners would have as CapEx is what they would be buying from dealers, not what we\u2019re selling to dealers. So, I think their CapEx numbers probably are going to look a little bit better than our sales number, because some of them will be out of dealer inventory, if that makes any sense to you at all. There are a couple of spots where we actually do have inventory that\u2019s a little bit beyond what you would think that was just a pipeline that\u2019s in process waiting to get put together or assembled and commissioned on site. But by in large most of the mining inventory around the world is a pipeline that\u2019s kind of on its way to dealers.Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research PartnersThat is helpful; and then if I can ask my quick follow-up, on hours run on mining equipment, has it come off at all, and I know Central Appalachia is a little down, but if you look to your global, total number of trucks running and total number of hours the aftermarket mining was down again this quarter. Are they running fewer hours or not?Douglas R. OberhelmanRob, I don\u2019t know the answer to that, if I did I\u2019d give an indication, but I don\u2019t. I did know that parts volume around coal mining is down, but in terms of hours elsewhere I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know the answer.Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research PartnersGreat. Thanks.Mike DeWaltOkay. The next question.OperatorThank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.Ann Duignan - JPMorgan Chase & Co.Hi, good morning, JPMorgan. And Doug, you and Jamie Dimon, can commensurate I think together. Yeah, my question is around China and the inventory overhang that we\u2019ve been dealing with there on the construction equipment side. I would be remissive, I didn\u2019t ask how that is going and where are we in that process and according to our context when we were over there in December that we\u2019ve got about a years worth of excess inventory still there, so maybe if you could update us in that region?Douglas R. OberhelmanI am not quite sure what the context is Ann, but in China remember they normally have a pretty good selling season in the spring, it's sort of disproportionate with the rest of the year in terms of seasonality. We have really not taken much inventory, our dealers have taken a bit of inventory out of China over the last quarter, but we\u2019ve not taken much inventory out. If you look at our $2 billion decline in the fourth quarter, actually very little of that had anything to do with China. Our view is that, that will be a first and second quarter phenomena as we go through the selling season. We're keeping production levels in China pretty low so that we can use the selling season to kind of soak up the inventory that's there. But certainly, there is not years' worth of sales.Ann Duignan - JPMorgan Chase & Co.Well, that was actually the President of LiuGong and also confirmed by comments on excavators in particular. And then can you talk about in general reducing your inventories, are you having to use financial services as a way of incentivizing sales in anyway, both either you or the dealers. We look around the world and it doesn't seem like the greatest environment we're trying to liquidate inventories. Can you talk a little bit about what you're having to do to get those inventories down?Mike DeWaltYeah, and I feel like in a little TV commercial we're doing it the old fashion way. If you think of inventory as a bucket with water flowing in and water flowing out, we've severely restricted the water flowing in. So we have really lowered production. That's the main driver of inventory down. There is no fire sale of finished inventory going on, it's lowering our production.Ann Duignan - JPMorgan Chase & Co.So no extended terms or changes in leasing arrangements or anything on the financial services side?Mike DeWaltI mean nothing of any materiality, no. I mean if you just think about it in context, sales to users have been relatively flat. We've lowered -- dealer lower orders rates, we lowered production, our inventory is going down, dealers are receiving less materials, their inventory is going down. So it really has to do with what's going into the channel. What's leaving the channel I think has been fairly stable.Ann Duignan - JPMorgan Chase & Co.Okay, I'll leave it there and get back in queue. Thanks.Mike DeWaltThanks, Ann. Next question, please.OperatorThank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz [Barclays Capital]. Please note your affiliation and pose your question.Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.Good morning, guys. It's Barclays.Mike DeWaltHi, Andy.Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.Mike, can you talk about the Bucyrus business in particular, maybe talk about its execution. Sales were up in the quarter, but margins were still I think pretty low, maybe how it's trending versus your expectations?Mike DeWaltYeah, I mean there's a lot of moving parts in Bucyrus. I'll make a few generalizations overall to kind of maybe frame it for the future. There is a lot that we're working on there, a lot of benefits that we're working hard to deliver. One of the things that we talk a lot about is putting Cat components in Bucyrus product, and we have what we've done that for some of the products, we've done that for some of the hydraulic shovels, have availability at Cat engines, that engineering work goes on. So, on one hand, there is a lot of extra engineering spend going on right now, Bucyrus to get that done. That's a big positive for the long term that we don't have completed yet and aren't really seeing much of the benefits. So that's sort of one point.We are in the middle of selling off to the dealers Bucyrus distribution, and again that's a good positive for the long run for us. That puts one of the world's premiere distribution and service organizations, the Cat dealer network squarely in the middle of driving aftermarket sales for that product. But we're still in the middle of doing that. In the short term, immediately after you do that, after you sell distribution to a dealer, they have essentially bought profit stream and they have margin, and our margin goes down. So while we're in this process of transferring the distribution to Cat dealers and they're ramping up and making improvements, and we're putting inventory in place, there is going to be a bit of a lag between the time that we lose margin because they bought it and the time where the good things that they can bring to it generate higher sales.So I think we'll probably be in a period for a year or two where we would think of sort of normalized -- I would hate to use that word, but if you look at the rest of the mining business, you have much higher margins. Because of the extra engineering work, the process of selling, distribution to the dealers, we're probably looking at more high-single digits for a while until the benefits start kicking in as opposed to mid-teens prior to the acquisition.Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.Mike, that's helpful. If I could step back and ask you maybe slightly more philosophical question. If I ask you about lean inventory strategy, like, this is sort of the first - I don\u2019t know if you want to call it mini downturn or whatever it is, to test this strategy. How would you assess this strategy? How has it worked and is there anything that you could do to improve it as you go forward?Mike DeWaltWell, you know there's always things you can do to improve it. I think lean inventory right now despite everything that we took out in the fourth quarter lean inventory did not \u2013 it was a piece of the total, but it wasn\u2019t the major piece of the total. I think we still and I talked about this a little bit ago, there is still too much inventory in China and again the post Chinese New Year selling season, we think we\u2019ll take care of much of that. Outside of that, generally speaking, it\u2019s our view that the lean inventory is by and large they\u2019re about the right level based on what we think we\u2019re going to sell.We\u2019ve got a good performance in terms of shipping out of Lane One and I think that is certainly going to be a contributor to dealers being able to take out some more inventory. So, it\u2019s like all things, there are things you can do better, while the overall inventory level excluding the China piece is probably close to what we would like it to be. There are some product that we wish we had less other than some products we wish we had little bit more. But I think by and large it\u2019s about the right amount and it\u2019s doing what we want.Bradley M. HalversonHi Mike, this is Brad Halverson, maybe I will make one quick comment here. As dealers start to reduce their inventory, it really kind of delayed the benefit that of all the actions that we really started on mid-year and we\u2019re really happy with the inventory reduction that came out in the fourth quarter. As we move forward, integrated supply chain from order to customer delivery is something we remained focused on and we\u2019d expect improvements throughout the years and we have operating targets at all of our units as we call it inventory turns to improve in 2013 and this will remain a focus for us. We see some opportunity in this space.Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.Thanks, Brad.Douglas R. OberhelmanI will just add also, I think you probably all read our announcement regarding Gerard Vittecoq, our Group President who is retiring in May of 2013. We\u2019ve asked him and a small team of very deep experts on everything from lean manufacturing to integrated supply chain to order to delivery to really study where we\u2019re right now and deliver by May timeframe, a vision and strategy to really take us into world-class levels of integrated supply chain and ordering, and I expect great things from that that study, as you're always really wound up about it and off to a great start, and we\u2019ll probably talk more about that at an analyst meeting later this year I suppose, but that will really chart us then for the finale that I would say of our CPS efforts between now and \u201915, and I am really excited about it. I will be leading that, cheerleading that and driving that the next couple of years.Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.Appreciate it.Mike DeWaltThanks. Next question please.OperatorThank you. Our next question today is coming from Eli Lustgarten. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow SecuritiesLongbow Securities. Good morning everyone.Mike DeWaltGood morning, Eli.Douglas R. OberhelmanHi, Eli.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow SecuritiesCan I just have one clarification, the $85 million R&D tax credit that are all going to be taken in the first quarter?Mike DeWaltYes.Douglas R. OberhelmanYes.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow SecuritiesOkay. Can we go back to resources; you basically said $2 billion, more than $2 billion down in the first quarter. I mean the implication and when you look at the years, the second and third quarter will be relatively flat and you hope you get enough orders to get to match the fourth quarter which was quite strong, is that sort of a fair profile of what we can expect?Douglas R. OberhelmanWell, Eli I\u2019ll respectively decline \u2013 I mean, we can try to give a little guidance on the first quarter. We tend not to do quarterly. I think the way and we\u2019ve kind of set it up and I wouldn\u2019t say it is specific to every quarter, but I think most of the \u2013 I don\u2019t know call it pain, inventory reduction, negative impact on sales and production and is likely to be in the first quarter. Again from an overall demand standpoint, we\u2019re looking at right now at the mid-point anyway for 2013 to be relatively similar to 2012. Again ups and downs by segment, as you mentioned mining, weaker construction, stronger power systems relatively flat, but I think what that leaves you, if you think about most of the decline being in the first quarter at the mid-point of our range it would tell you that we wouldn\u2019t be expecting big changes for the rest of the year.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow SecuritiesYeah. And then a follow-up, we have final Tier 4 being effective January 2014. Can you give us some idea of how that's going to affect Cat as you go through it? Do you plan to roll out the product issue at the beginning of next year? That's another big deal that we have to deal with, not as big as interim, but still some to deal with?Mike DeWaltI think at the risk of patting ourselves on the back too much, Tier 4 for us whether it was interim or work that's going on for final, has just gone exceptionally well. In our releases over the last couple of years and the outlook that we talked about today, you've not really heard us talk about one bad thing that was a result either on margins, pricing, costs. We haven't said one bad thing about Tier 4. The changes that we made in our R&D process, what we learned from Tier 3 we've applied, and it has gone very well. So I wouldn't expect -- if the rest of it goes anything like it has so far, I wouldn't expect anything negative.Douglas R. OberhelmanYeah. Mike's right, Eli, and I will just add here that we're about halfway to Tier 4 final, and certainly January of '13 brings up another batch of new machines in throughout the year as does January '14. And then in 2015, of course, we have heavy horsepower locomotive and inland marine and ocean going coming. So, so far our teams have just performed outstandingly with quality results on Tier 4 introductions and our customers are happy, our dealers are happy, but we're really just about halfway and the next 18 months are going to be heavy as you suggested.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow SecuritiesAll right. Thank you very much.Mike DeWaltOkay, I think we have time for certainly one more.OperatorThank you. Our final question today is coming from Ted Grace [Susquehanna Financial Group]. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial GroupHi, thank you. It's Susquehanna.Mike DeWaltHi, Ted.Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial GroupHey, Mike. How you're doing?Mike DeWaltGood.Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial GroupI don't know if this is for Mike or Doug or possibly if Steve is on the line, but we've talked about kind of the need for mining orders to inflect some point this year to potentially reach the goals, but could you at least characterize how sentiment feels on 2014, some mining companies have already given a framework; Vale, Freeport, Newmont to name a few, but can you just maybe give us a sense for based on what you're hearing, how you're thinking about 2014 on the Resource Industries side?Mike DeWaltYeah, this is Mike. I'll start it off and I'll let the other guys chime in as they would like to, but again, what's going to happen with mining is a function of world growth. What happens to commodity demand? As Doug mentioned earlier, we're I would say cautiously optimistic on China, which is good for commodities which stabilizes prices and ought to be good for mining. So, our long-term view of mining remains I think very good. The issue of declining ore grades and deeper mines is still there. So equipment sales over the long term in our view should outpace actually even mining production. So, I think the fundamentals economically around it look pretty good for the long term on our part. I'm not personally close to the miners. I don't talk to them. So I'm afraid I don't have any insight on that piece of it.Douglas R. OberhelmanYeah. I don't have much to add, it's Doug here, but I fully, fully believe that our idea on long-term mining around the world and our strategy to get after it whether it's surplus or underground is exactly the right one for this company. I'm not sure anybody saw -- could see the current cycle with what happened in China and slowdown, but having said that, we deal with cycles in this company and we have for many, many years. You know 2009 dropped 39% one year. We're used to this unfortunately, but I've got to believe that the decade out mining, the moves we've made in mining and the strategy that comes from that, if we execute well, will really pay off. I also think that at some point we're going to see world GDP above 2.5% and I don't know if it's '13, I hope it is and I don't know if it's '14, I really hope it is, but we'll see world growth move up to 3% to 4% at some point. I've got to believe that in our near-term future, if that happens, it's going to be mineral-driven. It has to be around the world as we\u2019ve seen every time. Housing starts we\u2019re calling for over 1 million, the drive for copper on that [SKU], if you all know that number. So, I'm still as optimistic as I\u2019ve ever been on mining long-term. The cycle we have to deal with and we always have and we\u2019ll get through it. But I really like the play, I think, I come back to the number of people on the planet that want to move up their standard of living and we all and over time that\u2019s played right to mining and arguably to some of our infrastructure disruption as well. But maybe in the long-term, I\u2019m still really bullish on what I see for mining.Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial GroupAnd then as a follow-up maybe a Brad or Mike question, if you look at the mid-point of earnings guidance and you think about pulling more inventory out and the guidance you\u2019ve given on CapEx, it looks like it could be a really big free cash year. So, I\u2019m wondering if you could just maybe frame out your expectations on free cash and then just philosophically how you\u2019re thinking about use of cash whether it\u2019s continuing to kind of fortify the balance sheet and build cash, any change in use towards dividend increase or buybacks and things of that sort, that would be great.Mike DeWaltWell, that\u2019s very longwinded question, Ted, and I\u2019ll get started on that. I think if you look at \u2013 we report on operating cash flow, so let\u2019s use that for a proxy, I think our expectation is that at the midpoint of our outlook range, we would see operating cash flow substantially better in \u201913 than \u201912, I mean, substantially. And the factors are declining inventory rather than increasing inventory, and I think there is a little bit of a timing impact there as well. I mean, we took $2 billion out of inventory in the fourth quarter and that was split between raw material work-in-process and finished goods, and so we had a quite sizable decline in payables related to that, and as that kind of stabilizes out, you won\u2019t have that year-over-year negative on that. So, I think all in all, from a cash flow perspective, 2013 looks like a better year relative to \u201912 than if you just look at the profit relative to \u201912. And I think beyond that in terms of our overall structure of our balance sheet, nothing has really changed over the last 30 days or three months in terms of what we\u2019re thinking about the future and how we structure the balance sheet.Bradley M. HalversonI would just say Mike, our balance sheet is strong right now. Our debt-to-cap is 37% under 30% on a net-to-cap basis. We\u2019ve over $5 billion in cash and so we did manage our CapEx down this year below expectations as the volume moved and so, we think we\u2019re in a great position. Capacity wise we\u2019re in a great position moving forward and clearly our priorities for cash that we\u2019ve talked about many times has not changed.Mike DeWaltThanks, Ted.Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial GroupThat\u2019s great guys. Congratulations. Good luck this quarter.Mike DeWaltWe are little past time, thank you for joining us and we will sign off.OperatorThank you ladies and gentlemen; this does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Mike DeWalt","Thank you very much and good morning everyone and welcome to our year end conference call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services.","On the call today, I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.","This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website, in the section labeled Results Webcast.","This morning we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, or Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2014 and with our 10-Q filed with the SEC in August of 2014. And it\u2019s also in the forward-looking statements language in today\u2019s release.","In addition to that, there is a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures and that can also be found in our financial release which again is on our caterpillar.com website.","Okay, with that let's get started. In this morning we'll be reviewing our financial results for the quarter, for the full year of 2014, and we\u2019ll spend some time on our 2015 outlook.","Now as I do each of those, I just want to go through the major themes right now. For the quarter, sales were about as expected but we were disappointed with lower profit in the quarter than our outlook. The significant decline in inventory in the quarter more so than we anticipated was a large contributing factor to that.","For the full year of 2014, the major theme continues to be around execution and better profit per share than 2013 and the outlook that we started the year with. We\u2019re pleased with what we've accomplished in 2014 given the continued weak economic conditions in most of the world, and the declining commodity prices.","Now for the 2015 outlook, well it's shaping up to be a much tougher year than we were expecting when we went through our preliminary view of 2015 with you all last October. It's been definitely a developing story as oil prices have continued to decline. No doubt it will be a major topic of discussion when we get to the QA in a few minutes.","With that, quick recap of the theme, let's start with the review of the fourth quarter. Sales and revenues were $14.2 billion and that was close to last year actually down about 1% from $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Profit per share all-in was $1.23 and $1.35 excluding restructuring costs. And that's down from a $1.54 all-in and a $1.68 excluding restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Quarter-to-quarter restructuring costs were a little lower in 2014 about $100 million in the fourth quarter versus about $130 million in Q4 of 2013. So not a lot of change there.","Excluding restructuring costs, profit per share from the fourth quarter of the year ago to this fourth quarter declined $0.33 and there were several things that contributed to the lower profit.","First, we had an absence of several favorable items from the fourth quarter of 2013. We had $115 million of LIFO benefits in the fourth quarter of 2013. We had a favorable legal settlement that was close to $70 million. We had gains on the sales securities and currency gains in our financial products segments. And in the fourth quarter of 2013, financial products also had a favorable adjustment to their allowance. Now, they had another favorable allowance in 2014 but it was quite a bit less.","Now in addition to the absence of those favorable items, we also had higher employee incentive compensation, that was about $110 million up in the quarter and that was because our incentive compensation metrics for the full year turned out better than we expected when we set them at the beginning of the year.","Excluding incentive compensation, SG&A [R&D] [ph] combined were up in the quarter, but were down for the full year. While R&D was about flat for 2014, we'll talk about this in a bit and the outlook that we are expecting have some increase in 2015.","We also had unfavorable inventory absorption in the quarter and that's a result of a more significant inventory reduction in the fourth quarter of 2014 than the fourth quarter of 2013.","Now, we also had some positives in the quarter. Income tax versus Q4 of 2013 was positive about $0.11 per share, material costs were favorable and price realization while up less than 1% was a small positive.","Profit per share also benefited from a lower share account and that was a result of share repurchases in 2014.","So that's the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2013. Let's take a look at how we did versus the outlook. And we ended nearly spot on with sales and revenues but profit per share was $0.12 lower than the outlook that we provided last October.","We did have one positive item in the quarter and that was the passage of the tax extenders. The major 2014 benefit for us was the R&D tax credit included in that.","More than offsetting in the favorable tax, we had some negatives. The most significant being the impact of negative inventory absorption. We were expecting a small inventory reduction in the fourth quarter and we actually ended up taking inventory down $1.1 billion. That resulted in a substantial cost absorption headwind versus our outlook.","While it was a hit to profit, we want lower inventory, we've been working to reduce it, and we\u2019re happy to have it lower.","Now in addition, price realization and sales mix were not quite as positive as we had expected and we had modest hedging losses. None of those were what I would describe as major and all on their own but they all kind of where in the same direction.","When you forecast you almost never get everything right, and even when you\u2019re close in total, there are always puts and takes. In the fourth quarter other than the R&D tax credit, most of the elements of our forecast went the other way.","In summary, Q4 was right on with sales. We had a major reduction in inventory and we like that but it continued to lower than expected profit.","Okay, that's a quick one through the fourth quarter versus the outlook. And before we get into the 2015 outlook, I would just like to do a quick recap of the full year 2014 and to help put it in perspective, I'm going to back in time a little bit to 2012 to set the stage.","In 2012 that was before the substantial decline in mining, our sales and revenues were about $66 billion. And as we ended 2012, we expected 2013 to be down because of mining and we got that in a lot more than we expected. We revised 2013 down every quarter in 2013, looking for a bottom in mining. We ended 2013 with sales down $10 billion from 2012.","At the end of 2013, we would have liked to predict the sales increase and recovery in 2014 but we started with the view but that wasn't in the cards for 2014 with mining remaining weak and the global economy continuing with the lower par growth.","We expected as a result 2014 sales to be about flat for 2013. And that\u2019s actually about what happened. The bad news is weren't surprised by a large rebound in the global economy, the good news is we called it pretty close to what happened and didn\u2019t get surprised with continuing bad news.","As we started 2014, we were expecting a relatively flat top line and relatively flat profit per share excluding restructuring costs. We accomplished that in a bit more. Excluding restructuring, profit per share was $6.38 and that's up from 597 in 2013 again excluding restructuring. And it was better than our original outlook at 585.","We also did better than we expected with operating cash flow. Our machinery energy and transportation operating cash flow was $7.5 billion. In 2014, in fact two of the best three years we've ever had were 2013 and 2014.","That helped to enable us repurchase $2 billion of Caterpillar stock in 2013 and another $4.2 billion in 2014 and it helped us - help set us up for increases in the dividend. We took the dividend up 15% in 2013 and 17% in 2014.","Now in addition to the financial performance, we improved inventory terms in 2014. We improved our market position for CAT machines as well in fact it was our fourth consecutive year.","And we\u2019ve done that by holding price realization low. 2014 was another year well below 1% and we've done it by providing customers with great products. While our Tier 4 introductions aren't over, we are very pleased with what's been introduced so far and customer and dealer feedback has been positive.","Quality is also helping. In 2014 it was the fourth consecutive year that the quality of the machines that we delivered to our customers has improved. I already mentioned better inventory terms and that was great. We\u2019re on a Lean journey and certainly we have more room to improve there.","I'll end up this recap of 2014 with safety and we probably don't really talk enough about it but it really is a high priority. And for the last decade we've made steady progress on improving safety and I'm happy to say that improvement continued in 2014.","So, all-in-all fourth quarter profit was disappointing but 2014 overall was a pretty good year financially particularly considering the economic and industry dynamics we had to work with.","Okay, with that let's go through the 2015 outlook. As I'm sure you picked up from our financial release this morning, we are more negative on prospects for 2015 than we were three month ago when we provided you with our preliminary view of 2015 sales and revenues.","In recent weeks with commodity price declines, our view of 2015 has certainly been a work in progress and we've just recently finalized the outlook.","Back in October, we expected sales and revenues with the flat to slightly up. Our current view is that sales and revenues will be about 50 million and that's down over 9% from 2014.","Without a doubt, the impact of substantially lower oil and gas prices is the most significant reason we're expecting lower sales in 2015. From mid-October to today, oil prices have dropped from the mid-80s to the high 40s and that's off prices that were around 100 for most of the first half of last year.","With the oil this low, we expect substantial reductions in producers CapEx and that it will be negative for our sales.","Now I'm going to take a minute to put what we do in our oil and gas into some perspective for you.","Most of our oil and gas related sales are in our energy and transportation segment. And to scale that a bit, in 2014 about a third of energy and transportation, 22 billion in sales were directly related to oil and gas.","The oil and gas exposure is however diverse. They're on the front-end with engines for drilling, engines transmission and pressure pumps for well servicing. We have engines that go into compressor sets for gas gathering, we\u2019ve engines and turbines that move oil and gas along the pipeline. And our turbines are used extensively on offshore production pipelines.","Now in addition to those direct exposures in energy and transportation, there are some indirect exposures that are real but a little more difficult to put a specific number on. ","For example, we saw marine engines and some go into vessels that service offshore oil and gas platforms on the rail business with services and locomotives and oil transport has become an increasing business for our rail customers.","In terms of the 2015 outlook, we believe the direct part of oil and gas that will be hurt the earliest and most significantly will be drilling and well servicing, particularly in the second half of the year.","At this point because of the scale and long term nature of projects to use turbines, we don\u2019t expect much impact there in 2015. However, if oil and gas prices stay this depressed throughout 2015, there could be a negative impact for the turbine business after 2015. So those are the most direct impacts.","Now there are other indirect impacts from substantially lower prices that we think can play in 2015. In countries and in fact in some areas of the U.S., where oil production is significant for government entities and local economies, it will likely be a negative for the sales of construction equipment and our electric power generation business.","In some cases, it can be fairly direct like building roads to service new wells, or it can be very indirect like construction spending in a country, where the government relies on oil revenue to fund government spending.","Order of magnitude roughly half of our expected year-over-year decline in sales is from these - both direct and indirect impacts from the fairly dramatic decline in oil prices.","Now in addition to the impact of oil and gas, there are several other factors that are contributing to the decline in the sales and revenues outlook. Year-over-year we expect the stronger dollar to be a sales headwind. Commodity prices in mining have also taken another leg down over the past few months.","For example, when we provided our preliminary outlook last October, copper was still over $3 account. Today it's in the mid $250.","Order rates for our resource industry segment have been reasonably stable at low level. But the continued decline in commodity prices and continued efficiency improvements, by our mining customers have caused us to lower our sales estimate for resource industries in 2015.","With weakness in agriculture, we\u2019re also expecting lower sales of industrial engines and we expect our rail business to be down in 2015 after a great year in 2014. Now that's not a new development, we anticipated that and discussed that last October.","And our expectation for the construction industry in China is also lower.","Our sales over the past year have held up better in China than the industry overall but with lower expectations for China construction, we think our 2015 sales in China will be down.","Okay, that's a run through of 2015 sales, the direct and some of the indirect impacts from dramatically lower oil, lower mining sales, or stronger dollar, lower sales in our rail business and weakness in construction outside the U.S. including China.","So let's shift over to profit. We\u2019re expecting 460 a share all-in for 2015 and 475 excluding restructuring. We\u2019re expecting to continue with restructuring actions in 2015 but with less cost than 2014.","In 2014, restructuring costs were $441 million and we\u2019re expecting around another $150 million in 2015.","Now excluding the restructuring, profit per share was expected to decline from 638 to 475. And that\u2019s a drop of about $1.63.","I\u2019m going to through the headwinds and tailwinds in a moment, but before I do that, I'd just like to put a drop and profit in perspective with the sales.","Much of the sales change between 2014 and 2015 is related to oil and gas and mining. And those are two areas with higher than average variable margins. Despite that, our $4.75 per share profit outlook again excluding restructuring reflects the decremental operating margin close to 25% and the impact of the higher tax rate that's mostly because the R&D tax credit wasn't extended past 2014.","Now our target range for decremental operating margin is 25% to 30% and our 2015 has us closer to the bottom end of that which is good.","But as you might expect, there are plenty of pluses and minuses that go into that. ","On the positive side, we expect lower incentive compensation in 2015. In 2014 incentive compensation was higher than target and that's because we exceeded our incentive metrics that we've set earlier in the year.","We're expecting variable manufacturing cost to be favorable in 2015. And that's a result of our continuing work to remove costs and improve efficiency and lower material costs.","Now this might be counterintuitive for some but the stronger dollar was negative for our sales is positive for costs overall and that's because of our non-US operations and our material purchases outside the U.S. and overall that's expected to be a positive for profit.","And we're planning another small but positive contribution from price realization. We\u2019re expecting an increase of less than half a percent.","Now the headwinds to 2015 profit include higher R&D expense. Now for the company in total, I\u2019m going back a couple of years here again. For the company in total, we lowered R&D 17% in 2013 from 2012 and that was in response to the decline in sales.","Now excluding the impact of incentive compensation, R&D remained at about that level in 2014. In 2015, we\u2019re planning to increase R&D. We\u2019re in a very competitive and changing world and products and services do matter.","We understand the need for profit in a short term but we also need to invest in the future and that's the main reason R&D is increasing. It's primarily for new and updated products, and more work on new technologies, that have applications across the company.","In addition to R&D, cost absorption from lower inventory is also expected to be a headwind. With the decline in sales, we expect, more inventory reduction in 2015 than we had in 2014. And while that's a positive for cash flow, it will have a negative impact on costs.","And as I mentioned a minute ago, with a greater proportion of our expected decline in sales occurring in the higher margin products, we anticipate an unfavorable mixed impact from sales on our operating module.","We also have higher pension expense for our defined benefit plans and that's a result of lower interest rates at the end of 2015 and an revision in the estimate of lifespans for the folks in our plans.","Okay, that's a run through of what we expect for 2015. The bottom line for us is - in our business is that it has been and continues to be a tough environment for many in the industries that we're in. Mining is weak and operating below what we think a normal level is and far below the prior peak.","From an industry volume standpoint, North American construction was better than it was a couple years ago, there is still about 15% below the prior peak. Europe is about over 40% of its prior peak and China is still 60% of its prior peak. So we aim to grow in all those areas.","Energy and transportation, it's a diverse business serving oil and gas, transportation, power generation and industrial applications. It's been a great business for us and we\u2019re expecting another good year in 2015. It will be good but not quiet as good as 2014.","Based on our outlook for 2015 sales and revenues, 2015 is going to be our third consecutive year of sales decline. And to put that in some perspective, that's happened only one other time in the history of our company and that was during the great depression in 1930, 1931 and 1932.","Overall, we think we have done pretty well with the economic and industry climate we have to work with. We have improved our market position and our operations but we would certainly like to see a better global economy.","So that's it. And with that, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays. Your line is live.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys. Mike, I think you did a good job on the puts and takes of the 2015 profit guidance, but let me push you a little bit here. Like, you talked about being in the range that you usually have 25% to 30% decrementals; but you are enjoying that $400 million tailwind from stock comp expense.","We've talked about restructuring benefits starting to ramp up in 2015, and I'm not sure how much that's going to help. Then obviously you mentioned the stronger dollar helping you. I know you've talked about mix and I know you've talked about inventory destocking. But maybe you could quantify something like inventory destocking or -- what I'm really trying to figure out, Mike, is if there is an element of conservatism at all in this guidance.","Mike DeWalt","You know we try to be prudent. There are always upsides and downsides in the forecast. We always attempt to try if we can to pick up middle reasonable ground. You did pick out currency as a modest positive and you are right, the incentive comp is positive as well.","But - and on the restructuring, we do expect favorable variable cost next year and above and beyond just material cost. So we do have some improvement baked in for that.","But we do have again I am just a little bit repeating what you said. Mix is negative. We've got a $5 billion decline in sales and that is I think - between that and the continuation of our Lean journey, we are likely to take inventory down more next year and we have somewhere around 15% to 18% negative hit to profit from cost absorption on that.","So that's going to be negative for the year. R&D is probably not going to be quite back to the 2012 levels but we do need to fund some more.","We've got a ton of exciting programs for the future that we need to get on with now and so we\u2019ve planned to do some funding of that. So it - again the two tailwinds are step and the incentive compensation in a little bit from currency to the bottom line.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay Mike.","Mike DeWalt","I don\u2019t feel like I added a lot more for you there but\u2026","Andrew Kaplowitz","Is it possible to quantify restructuring benefit that you expect? You've given us in the past, is it possible to quantify that?","Mike DeWalt","For next year\u2026","Andrew Kaplowitz","2015.","Mike DeWalt","Actually after this last decline in volume for us, we are reworking the detailed plans but before that we were looking at somewhere around - increment of somewhere around $100 million.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. Then just shifting gears, can you give us more color on construction, global construction demand in general? At least what's baked into your forecast in 2015? Do you believe North American construction will be up in 2015? Or at least what's in your guidance for that geography.","Mike DeWalt","So if we look at sales for construction, we just talked about it generically regionally. We are looking to be up in the U.S. next year, North America mostly the U.S. Probably a little less than we thought before the oil price dropped. So we are looking ahead. There is some headwinds in the oil producing areas, Texas, South Dakota, Pennsylvania.","So U.S. is still a positive but probably not quite as positive as we thought before. Almost everyplace else in the world to some degree negative. We are still not getting any decent economic growth in Europe. The developing countries Brazil, China are still let\u2019s just say challenged. We are actually expecting a little bit lower GDP growth in China next year than we had in \u2013 or in 2015 than we had in 2014. So we are looking for the - outside the U.S. construction to be weak.","We also have quite a bit of the sales impact from the stronger dollar showing up in construction as well. So it will bear most of the brunt of that.","We\u2019ve taken a stab at trying to estimate the impact of lower oil in the oil producing regions. I will say that that's probably - that's tough to forecast. We don\u2019t exactly know what the Saudis, the Nigerians are going to do, but just using those two oil exporting countries as an example. There are certainly many more.","We don\u2019t exactly know what they are going to do but we\u2019ve taken our best shot. So we\u2019ve taken sales out of those regions as well.","But I think if you were to combine it into kind of nutshell, we are looking down 5% to 10%. Currency is a chunk of that outside the U.S. generally. Oil producing regions weaker, U.S. not including, oil is stronger.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. Thanks Mike.","Operator","We will take our next question from Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, thanks guys, good morning. Maybe just starting a little bit with oil, I'm just curious what exactly you are hearing from your customers. I think if we looked back to 2010 it took several quarters for this impact to start bleeding through to your results. So I'm just curious how soon we'll start to see the weakness come through, both in your retail sales and in Cat's reported results.","Mike DeWalt","Yeah that\u2019s actually a great question Nicole because if you look at the 2014 fourth quarter or December even retail sales statistics, oil and gas was still pretty strong and it will probably continue that way for a while. I mean we are selling out of the backlog. So what we will be seeing first is \u2013 and we are actually starting to see it now.","So I guess this is what we are hearing from customers is a decline in order rates for oil and gas. It probably won\u2019t show up in our sales for at least a quarter maybe a bit more than a quarter in the second half of the year particularly for re-step engines, piston-based engines for drilling and well servicing. Our sales are likely to fall off quite dramatically for that kind of product in this \u2013 certainly in the second half of the year.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, got it. That makes sense. Then I guess maybe a somewhat philosophical question. How much does a strong US dollar concern Cat generally, given that you have such a strong base of sales in international markets? And to that point, are you seeing increased competitive intensity yet from Japanese or European OEMs?","Mike DeWalt","That's a great question too. So generically, what we\u2019ve done over the last I don\u2019t know 30 years basically is try to diversify our cost base to try to help it match up a little bit better with sales.","If you take 2015 for example, the stronger dollar, as we convert all those sales from local currencies around the world and the dollars is going to translate into fewer dollars, the flipside of that is we have substantial manufacturing operations outside the U.S. and that largely mitigates the profit impact.","So we have in the case of stronger dollar a decent sizeable negative impact on sales with a positive impact on cost. Usually it\u2019s not too big of an impact one way or the other on profit although it can depend on which currency moves and how much.","Doug Oberhelman","Yeah. It's Doug Oberhelman here. I will just add a little bit broader perspective on that thing. Rising dollar and I will expect that 2015 would see more of that will not be good for U.S. manufacturing nor the U.S. economy.","How that is offset against the lower oil, diesel, gasoline price, I don\u2019t know how it worked out but certainly anybody producing in Japan, the U.K. or Europe particularly Germany is going to have, it has had quite an advantage over their American competitors and I would expect that they have an impact on the U.S. in some way.","We worked hard to as Mike said diversify our manufacturing footprint. We are large exporters and have a large cost base in Japan, Europe, U.K. as well as we are taking advantage of that, as you mentioned, works its way through to the bottom line.","But overall I think it\u2019s a very good positive for U.S. manufacturing unit. The policy issue I think is concerning.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, great. I really appreciate the commentary, Doug and Mike. I will pass it on.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from our Robert Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question. ","Robert Wertheimer","Thanks, Mike. Just wanted to follow-up on oil and gas. Obviously you've taken a big whack to the drilling and the completions, the pressure pumping. But have you heard anything on production platforms on maintenance for solar turbines in the Gulf or in Nigeria or wherever? Have you factored any weakness in either production or maintenance into the account -- into the outlook? And if not, do you expect any could develop later into 2016?","Mike DeWalt","I think from a service standpoint, no. We haven\u2019t been hearing that. Once the platform is up in producing, we've got all that fixed cost sunk into it. So, you know it\u2019s likely to continue to produce.","So, no and even on, turbo machinery projects not just service for solar, the nature of that business is rather a long term projects. By the time, we produce a turbine, the project is pretty far along.","So, considering a lead times there, and the kind of projects that are there, you tend not to get big short term swings. It's not like somebody is coming in and buying something out of inventory of the shelf.","So, we really don\u2019t see much of an impact with solar for 2015. But, and I mentioned this a bit in my lengthy preamble, that if oil prices and gas prices stay this low, so large not immune it\u2019s just delayed.","Robert Wertheimer","All right, perfect. That was very helpful, Mike. Thank you. Then just a quick one. It seems as though 1Q will still have some deliveries on the 3500s or whatever to the drilling and pressure pumping. Should we assume that the back half of the year has basically almost nothing in it? I mean, the fleet has grown tremendously over the last 10 years. Maybe replacement sales continue to grow. I'm not sure if we should consider the back half to be the bottom or not on the drilling and completion side. And I will stop; thanks.","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. Certainly won\u2019t be the first quarter or second quarter. It will probably start tailing off as we get towards the end of the first half.","But yeah, we've had actually some cancellations, so the backlog has come down. There\u2019s been some cancellations, but that seems to have tailed off. So, we're scheduled out reasonably for the first quarter.","We think some of that is, if you have a well that's getting drilled, you\u2019ll want to frac it. So, we think that what\u2019s in the order book here, certainly for the first quarter is probably going to continue.","But orders have largely dried up for that kind of business. So, the back half of the year is going to drop a lot for the drilling and well servicing.","Doug Oberhelman","Probably not so much gas compression. It\u2019s really not for the turbine projects but you know, for the drilling and well servicing around oil and particular, yes.","Robert Wertheimer","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Joel Tiss. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question. ","Joel Tiss","Hi, I'm with BMO. Instead of beating up energy anymore, I wonder if you can give us a sense of why the resource industry dealer inventory went up a little bit, it sounds like in the press release. I just wonder if you're seeing anything positive there, or just what's going on.","Mike DeWalt","No. Actually dealer inventory went down. It just didn\u2019t go down quite as much as it did in the fourth quarter of 2013. It's a very challenged business.","If you look at order rates from customers, they\u2019ve been, they bounce around a little bit here and there month to month but if you look at the moving average, they\u2019ve been pretty stable here recently.","But it's actually been below our sales level. We've been selling a bit out of the backlog. The backlog in mining is getting to a point where we just don\u2019t have the capability to continue to do that.","So, in light of copper coming down around 250, iron ore prices severely depressed and coal prices down, we\u2019re taking a cautious view of 2014 for mining.","We were hoping that 2014 was the bottom but given everything else that is going on in the world, at least our estimate of China GDP being a little lower next year than this year, I think the prospects for a rebound in 2015 are just probably not there. So, that's negative.","There's also probably a small negative in there - I don't want to overplay this, but we do sell into the oil sands in Canada and we think there is not a - in the scheme of next year\u2019s business, it's not huge but we do think there is a little bit of risk there as well.","Joel Tiss","I wonder if you can share with us the overall company OEM versus aftermarket at this point, or over the course of 2015. I think it's a fuzzed-up enough number where you wouldn't really be giving anything away, but you'd help us understand the resiliency of Cat's earnings a little better.","Mike DeWalt","What I would tell you is that - as we talked about this outlook change, I will try to frame in a couple of different ways. What are the causes, like oil prices and that goes across the segment.","And then we try to give you a view by segment. RI down 10%, E&T 10% to 15%, construction 5% to 10%. But your point about original equipment and parts is a good one. I won't give you a complete split, but I would tell you that we would expect aftermarket parts to be pretty flat next year. With this year we\u2019re not taking that down.","So the decline for the most part is coming out of new equipment.","Joel Tiss","But you can't give us any sense if it's half of the overall business or anything?","Mike DeWalt","No we've never done that Joel and probably not going to start today.","Joel Tiss","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ross Gilardi. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question. ","Ross Gilardi","Yes, good morning, Bank of America. Gentlemen, I'm just comparing your comments on construction to what we were hearing from the large rental houses, who are substantially more positive. Obviously your business model is different, and also for Cat Rental the fleet mix is different. But do you think dealers are losing marketshare to the bigger rental houses who've improved their footprint, are getting better at servicing the national account customers, and just their overall service offerings dramatically in recent years? Anything you feel like you need to do from just a business model standpoint to deal with them?","Mike DeWalt","Well, first off, Ross, I will start by saying we\u2019re actually pretty constructive about U.S. construction. So we have U.S. construction actually going up.","I think probably the major rental houses that you\u2019re talking about our U.S. base are probably not feeding back what - what\u2019s going on, Brazil, the rest of Latin America, China, Europe. So, that is the - that plus currency impacts which there is also not seeing are, two principle reasons that construction would be down next year.","So I think from a North American standpoint, honestly I don\u2019t know, what the rental houses are actually telling you in terms of volume. But we\u2019re up probably, mid-single digits in North America construction despite a little headwind we think from oil.","I think the dealers are actually doing a pretty good job on rental. It's been an increasing piece of their business. It\u2019s a big focus that particularly in the U.S. and Europe, its how a lot of business gets done.","It\u2019s a key element of our across-the-table initiative and we\u2019ll probably do more. So, it\u2019s a big focus. I think if you parse out how we\u2019re describing the construction around the world, probably not that far off with what the rental houses are saying.","Ross Gilardi","Yes, okay. I mean, I realize there are big geographic differences in your overall footprint. I was more isolating just the commentary around North America; but thanks for clarifying that.","And then given what you're saying about demand and the overall environment for Caterpillar in your various end markets, what are you thinking now about capacity rationalization across your footprint right now? Should we be expecting to see some bigger facility closures as 2015 unfolds, to better align supply and demand for the medium to longer term?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. You know, we're -- how I say this with the right tone here? We're a cyclical company. Our sales in these industries as we've seen by mining and certainly oil and gas go up and down. What we try to do is manage best we can the fixed cost structure, the physical bricks and mortar capacity. You need that for when the business recovers.","So we have another $150 million in for restructuring cost in 2015, but I wouldn't say there aren't any large scale plant closures in there. Certainly $150 million wouldn't cover that. We have done a pretty good job on trying to flex our period cost down. That's where we're really focused, not so much on bricks and mortar.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kwame Webb. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Kwame Webb","Hello, this is Kwame Webb from Morningstar. Thanks for taking my question today. For me on the Caterpillar Financial side, I was curious to know: what are you guys thinking in terms of loss allowances for 2015? And then on a related note, I'd imagine the dealers are going to help you with repositioning some used equipment. What do dealer used inventories look like right now?","Brad Halverson","Yeah. This is Brad Halverson. You know, CAT Financial had another good year in '14. In fact, if you look at the credit metrics in '14, you'll see a positive story. Our write-off were down, our past dues moves from down to 2.17 from about 2.4 last year. We get this question every now and then and our China business continues to form well. Their past dues were also down.","And so, we are seeing some softening in the used equipment market in the last few months mining is actually held up pretty well during the year. We'll see how that carries forward in the next year. But at this moment, I would say that we don't have any concerns relative to our portfolio performance and past dues coming off another year of improvement and I'd say we'd pretty stable heading into '15.","Kwame Webb","And then just a follow-up on the Resources business. There was some commentary about aftermarket sales improving, and I think you guys actually said that you expect '15 aftermarket to be flat with '14. Could you comment on what specific product lines you're seeing strength or stability?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. I mean for aftermarket just generically the rate of change is much, much less cyclical than new equipments. So even in the areas over the last -- like mining where it's been down over the last couple of years, it's down much, much less than the new equipment sales would be.","As we look forward to next year, I would say we don't see any material changes in any other segment. There might be a little change around the edges, but nothing significant up or down by segment.","Kwame Webb","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning, JPMorgan. My question is around capital spending. You're keeping your CapEx budget flat year over year; R&D is going up. Should we be a little bit concerned that Caterpillar is expecting a quick recovery in the oil business? Or can you just dig a little bit deeper into why you're holding CapEx flat? We would have expected with earnings down this much that CapEx will be down significantly also.","Brad Halverson","Hi Ann, this is Brad Halverson. May be I'll talk just a little bit about cash and I'll get to answer your question directly as well. We talked a lot with you guys about improving our balance sheet coming out of '08. And when we got to the end of '13 we were very happy with our balance sheet in terms of our debt to cap, net debt to cap being around 17 and carrying about $6 billion in cash.","And we had another very good year, $7.5 billion of operating cash flow and our CapEx was fairly well below our planned outlook for the year. I think you'll find 1.6 being a fairly low number for us and well below what we thought in 2014.","And so, we finished the year with net debt to cap around 18 and around $7 billion in cash. And so, we're very happy with where the balance sheet is. In fact, our working capital as a percent of sales as we worked on lean and other initiatives is at a record low, around 12%.","So all that said is that we feel really good about where our balance sheet is positioned. Our priorities outside of maintaining the debt rating would be growth. And we talked a little bit earlier with Andy; we're spending a significant increase on R&D in '15 over '14. And that's a big part of how we want to deploy cash. And of course, that hits the P&L.","I think CapEx around 1.6 is a reasonable number going into '15. There is a decent amount of that. That's a normal replacement type activity to go in our manufacturing facilities. As you know, we're fairly highly vertically integrated which creates a little high replacement kind of demand for capital. So I would say that's fairly reasonable going into that.","You may want to ask a little bit and I'll just jump to it around deployment of cash. And I would say that we're continuing to look for growth opportunities, we're not announcing anything today but that activity remains very important to us and we're continuing to focus on that. The energy valuations are clearly dropped and so that's something that many are looking at including us.","We're really happy with the balance sheet position. We'll consider stock repurchase as heading to 2015. But again, those priorities remain pretty well the same for us then.","Mike DeWalt","Hey Ann, I think I'll just embellish one thing on what Brad said. If you look at the CapEx that we do have a lot of NPI, it's maintenance. It's not focused around capacity.","Ann Duignan","Yeah. Okay. I did pick up on that. So that's at least valuable to understand. And then, my follow-up question is getting more philosophical. A lot of the restructuring spend that you've been doing the last few years has been in Europe, to make -- to set up Europe for Europe, I think is what the program was called. Given where currencies stand now if you were embarking on that restructuring, would you do anything different? If we get to parity, euro versus dollar, would it make sense to be keeping manufacturing in Europe?","Doug Oberhelman","I'll comment here, Ann. It's Doug. We had some fundamentally, I would say, dysfunctional and not working operations in Europe, not productive, not efficient that we really needed to work through. Where we will land up when we're done there and we're closing in on that as a really lean manufacturing system and operations that are sized for that business in a euro at parity will just be a great tailwind for that.","I would point out our good notebook plan in France that we downsized makes wheeled excavators today. It's one of the models we have in the world in terms of throughput, high quality machines and lower lead time. And so, we like that and I think the currency benefit will just be kind of gravy on that.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I'll leave it there and get back in line. I appreciate the color.","Mike DeWalt","Thank you, Ann.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vishal Shah. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Vishal Shah","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. How much of a headwind would you expect the dealer inventory to represent in 2015? And how much of that excess inventory is in oil and gas versus construction and mining?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. Good question. In -- the majority of the inventory by far is machines, the actual engine inventory is quite a bit less. It's not that they don't have any, but just in terms of scale it's quite a bit less. We're likely to have and also embedded into our forecast for next year is further decline in dealer inventory.","So I think it's a case where we've got sales coming down $5 billion, dealers try to peg their inventory around what expected sales are. And so, when sales come down, they take inventory down. And that's -- we expect that to happen next year. So I think it will probably at least as much as we had this year.","Vishal Shah","Okay, that's helpful. Just on the E&T business, I know you mentioned 10% to 15% decline in sales. As you think about the decremental margin for that business, should we be assuming the decrementals to be above the 30% or 25% target in 2015?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah. Again it depends on the products in E&T. I think certainly in the oil and gas area, that the margins there would be above the average and so that would be negative to their decrementals.","Locomotives would probably be on - new locomotives, the services businesses very profitable. But locomotive less so, there are some industrial engines as well are down. So again that\u2019s probably a little below average on margins.","So on balance, I would think that E&T has it going both ways and probably not dramatic in total.","Vishal Shah","Thank you so much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","David Raso","Evercore ISI. My question is about especially the lag of some of these adverse impacts. I'm just trying to think of Cat's earnings power run rate exiting 2015. I think people are just trying to figure out where 2015 sets up going into 2016.","And just seeing the lag impact, can you maybe give us some cadence on how you're seeing the EPS play out for the rest of the year? It just seems like the back half of the year maybe we're looking at $2 in the back half, or less; or the fourth quarter at least running below $1. I'm just trying to make sure we understand how you see your earnings power exiting 2015, as it reflects on people's thoughts on 2016.","Mike DeWalt","Good questions David. I think forward to 2016, there are so many things that we don\u2019t yet know the answer to, and I'll just give you a couple here.","One with lower oil prices its driving lower gasoline prices, and that ought to be an economic stimulus from our consumer standpoint. How that plays out in world economic growth, what the actions with the ECB are taking, how that plays into world growth, whether or not China remains satisfies around seven or tries to push it up, all those things right now, we don't really know the answer to.","They could be positive, they could be negative, at this points it's hard to say on 2016.","David Raso","Yes. I'm not asking you to predict 2016. Right now \u2013 if I could predict that we'd all retire tomorrow. I'm just trying to figure out the idea of -- are we exiting the back half of 2015 at a $2 back half, or a $1 per quarter run rate? And then however we view 2016 is predicated on how you see commodity prices through 2015. I'm just trying to make sure we understand the earnings power run rate exiting 2015.","Mike DeWalt","I think if oil and gas -- if oil prices and gas prices don't go up and we\u2019re not forecasting them too. We would have much more of a follow off in the oil and gas sales in the back half of the year which would imply more of a negative in the back half.","David Raso","Well, maybe just said another way, the greatest sales decline in 2015, is it the fourth quarter? The EPS sets up to be the lowest for the year? I'm just trying to figure out - ","Mike DeWalt","Probably third and fourth quarter - third and fourth quarter. We\u2019ll start exhausting the backlog of drilling and well servicing probably as sometime in the second quarter I would guess.","David Raso","Okay. I really appreciate it. Thank you.","Doug Oberhelman","I think we have time - so we'll do one more.","Operator","We will take the last question from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliations then pose your question.","Jamie Cook","Hi, I guess most of my questions have been asked. But Doug, I just don't know if you'll be willing to provide to the Street your -- I mean, there's the concern the oil and gas cycle is the next mining cycle that we had. So can you just provide your view on what that risk is and how would you manage your business differently given what we learned from mining?","Doug Oberhelman","I would say tough question obviously. We saw our mining lose half of its sales in our segment in \u2013 really under a year about a year.","Our energy and transportation business last year was 20 billion plus. I would not see that happening on that scale at all because we don\u2019t have the exposure to oil and gas in that segment as we did with mining in the resource segment.","And that's probably about as far a I will go because as I said here today, if we see oil and all those who were forecasting oil at $20 and those who are forecasting gas at $1.50, some forecasting higher gas and higher oil, and I'm not going to make it commitment or even a forecast on that.","But what our commitment is to you all, is that 25% to 30% decrement on the way down and 25% on the way up. We've done pretty well with that. I don\u2019t like these top line gyrations that we\u2019re getting and we\u2019ve seen. But our managing of those ups and downs have been - I think pretty well in the last few years and that\u2019s what we would commit to if we have to go further down or if we get lucky and it goes up.","Jamie Cook","All right. Thanks. I will get back in queue.","Doug Oberhelman","Thank you all very much and we\u2019ll talk with you again at the end of the first quarter.","Operator","Thank you very much.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Brad Halverson, CFO. Sir, the floor is yours.","Bradley M. Halverson - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thank you. Well, good morning and welcome to our year-end earnings call. I'm Brad Halverson, Caterpillar's CFO. On the call with me this morning we have our CEO, Jim Umpleby; Amy Campbell, our Director of Investor Relations; and as has been the case for 48 consecutive quarters, Mike DeWalt, our Vice President of Finance Services. This is Mike's last conference call. He will start his retirement on March 1 after 36 years with Caterpillar.","Mike has led our quarterly earnings call since early 2005. He's done it as the Director of IR, the Controller and now as the Vice President of Financial Services. He's led this call through two peaks, the first one ending in 2008 and the second one in 2012, and he's been a steady hand through two down cycles; 2009, and a downturn that we find ourselves in at the moment.","Mike has been a great value to this company. He knows our business extremely well. He's a very smart guy. He's been a good friend. He'll continue to be a good friend, and we wish him all the best. But Mike, we thank you for everything you've done, and this is your last call. And those of you who can't see Mike, he's smiling right now.","So with that, I'm going to turn the meeting over to our CEO, Jim Umpleby.","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thank you, Brad, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. After I make a few opening remarks, I'll turn the meeting over to Mike and he'll cover the Safe Harbor and also get into our results in more detail.","We had good operational performance in the fourth quarter and in 2016, despite challenging market conditions. Our sales and revenue were down $8.5 billion or 18%. Decremental margins were better than our target. We achieved over $2 billion of cost reduction in the year, which helped to offset the lower sales volume. We had strong operating cash flow, and we continue to invest in key areas of our business that are critical for our future profitable growth.","At the midpoint of our sales and revenue range, our sales will be down slightly in 2017. We continue to closely manage costs. We're also preserving capacity for a potential increase in business whenever that comes. There are positive signs in many of our markets, but we are not anticipating an impact in 2017.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mike to get into more detail. Then we'll have some wrap-up comments after Q&A.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Everyone, today, we'll handle this call much like we have the past few. We'll be walking through a short slide deck, and then we'll move on to Q&A. And if you don't have that slide deck in front of you at the moment, it's available at our caterpillar.com website with the conference call webcast link. And as always, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website and it will be in a section labeled results webcast.","So if you go to page 2 of the slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. And this morning for sure we are going to be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. In addition to page 2 of the slide deck, there is a discussion of some of the factors that individually, or in the aggregate, could make our actual results to differ materially from our projections, and that can be found in our cautionary statements under item 1A, risk factors of our Form 10-K, filed with the SEC, and also in the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release.","In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both our financial release and this presentation, which can be found in today's earnings release. And again, that's also posted on our caterpillar.com website.","So, with that, let's get into the quarter and turn to page 4 of our slide deck for today. And that's the high-level summary of fourth quarter sales and profit. So sales and revenues for the quarter were about $9.6 billion and that's down about 13% from the fourth quarter of 2015 which was just a little over $11 billion. Now, we lost $2 per share in the fourth quarter this year versus $0.16 a share last year in the fourth quarter and if you \u2013 if you look at the primary drivers of profit, big contributors to that were the mark-to-market adjustment that we made for the pension liability, we impaired $595 million worth of goodwill, and on that particular topic, there's a Q&A in the release. I think it's the first Q&A, and I think that does a pretty good job of talking through those adjustments.","In addition to that, we have a valuation allowance on deferred taxes. That was unfavorable. And those three items, plus restructuring costs are the items that we're adjusting out between profit per share and adjusted profit per share. And adjusted profit per share coincidentally year-over-year was flat at $0.83 per share. And that's \u2013 to Jim's point earlier, I think that's pretty good performance. On a 13% decline in sales, our adjusted profit was flat. And that's because we had a lot of cost reduction in the quarter just like we had a lot of cost reduction in the year. Period and variable costs, and we'll talk about this in a minute, a little bit more, were favorable just under $0.5 billion. So that was good performance.","Let's move on to page 5. It's a little more discussion about the sales change. So Energy & Transportation, which by sales is the largest segment, dropped about $695 million in sales and about half of that was Transportation, and that is rail and marine. Oil and Gas was down a little and power gen was down a little as well. Power gen has been weak in particular in the Middle East.","Resource Industries, down $435 million from just under $1.9 billion to a little over $1.4 billion for the quarter and that's all new equipment. So aftermarket was actually up for the third quarter in a row sequentially, and it was actually up a little bit year-over-year. So fourth quarter was a little higher than the fourth quarter of last year, and that's a good signal. Price realization on the other hand was negative $62 million in the quarter.","If we go down to Construction, Construction sales were about $300 million lower, and most of that is in North America and Europe, Africa, Middle East. Actually Asia-Pacific was up quarter over quarter, and a lot of that came from strength in China that we've seen so far this year. So, again, in total, we were down about $1.456 billion quarter over quarter.","If we move on to page 6, this is a waterfall chart that sort of reconciles, I guess, operating loss in the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year, and it's everything, all in. So a big negative was $463 million and that's on that $1.4 billion decline in sales. Price realization, which has been fairly significantly negative most of the year moderated quarter over quarter in this quarter. It was negative $80 million, and most of that was, as I mentioned on the prior page, Resource Industries.","Cost reduction variable $91 million; period, $401 million. So that's good. That's a continuation. And I would mention that we had more incentive compensation in 2015 than we did 2016, but in the fourth quarter, it wasn't a factor. We had very little in both fourth quarters. So this $492 million all but was not affected hardly at all by the short-term incentive pay.","Currency was pretty neutral. Financial Products was down a bit. They had less gains on the sale of securities in their insurance business. There was a little bit more loss, and that's a result of, I think, lower used equipment prices on repossessed and returned equipment. And their volume was lower, the earning assets were down. And that's \u2013 in some ways it's a progression of what's happened to our sales over the last few years. Our sales are down, so the amount of what they're financing is down a bit as well.","Restructuring costs in the quarter were quite a bit less than the fourth quarter of 2015. And I'm going to talk a little bit more about restructuring costs here in a minute. Then we have a couple of big negatives. Mark-to-market losses, that's essentially the present value of the future liability of our pension and benefit plans. It was a loss of $985 million this year versus $214 million a year ago, and that's essentially because interest rates on high-quality, long-term bonds declined slightly in the year.","Goodwill impairment was $595 million, and that was in our Surface Mining & Technology business. We impaired about half of the goodwill in their business. And on the final other line we had legal charges in the fourth quarter of last year that we didn't have this year, and that's most of that difference. So that's a bit of a walk through operating profit.","Let's turn to page 7. Let's make a few comments about the full year. Sales were down from \u2013 and revenues \u2013 from $47 billion to about $38.5 billion. That's an 18% drop. Profit per share in 2015 was $4.18, and again this year it was a loss of $0.11. If you take out items that we're adjusting for, and again that's the mark-to-market, the goodwill, restructuring costs, and the tax impairment, we were at $3.42. And that's a little bit better than our final outlook of the year that we gave at the end of the third quarter. That was $3.25. We ended up at $3.42. So that's good.","Again, the drivers of the adjusted profit change on the bottom right are very similar to what happened in the quarter. We had lower sales volume but a lot of cost reduction that offset that, or at least offset a part of it, about half in fact. So that's a little on the full year.","Let's move to page 8 and talk a little more about cost reduction. I mentioned this earlier, but we had $492 million in the fourth quarter. For the year, it was over $2.3 billion of lower costs. And if you go down to the bottom, the three little boxes that start on the right, there was a piece of that that is related to short-term incentive compensation, and there's a Q&A in the back of the release that has all the numbers for the quarter and the year for that. But a little over $300 million of that $2.3 billion was incentive compensation lower.","If you move into the middle, we had good material cost reduction again for the year, and it's a combination of commodity-related prices versus 2015 and then, as always, even without commodities, we do a lot of work every year on sourcing and design to lower costs, and that was a positive. And then on the most significant item on the left, our restructuring, and that is reducing people, reducing floor space, consolidating functions and facilities, and we've done quite a lot of that.","In fact, if you turn to page 9 here, we'll cover restructuring \u2013 the big restructuring that we announced a little over a year ago. I thought this might be a good kind of recap on what's happened. On September 24 of 2015, we had a big press release that covered a number of fairly significant actions that we were planning to take. And in that release, we said we were going to close or consolidate about 20 facilities, which would reduce manufacturing floor space by about 10% and take about 10,000 people out of our workforce. We said that it would cost about $2 billion to do that, about $1.6 billion of it cash and about $400 million noncash, which would have been primarily asset-related expenses. And we also said when it was fully implemented, we would save about $1.5 billion annually going forward, and we thought that would take a few years to complete.","So if we go on to page 10, let's kind of talk through a little bit what's happened. And I realize there are a lot of words on this page, but we've either completed or announced or are in the process of implementing virtually everything that was in our press release from the third quarter of 2015 and then some. That's involved the consolidation and closure of \u2013 actually ended up more than 30 facilities and about 14% of floor space. We said we were looking to take down the workforce by about 10,000. It's actually declined about 16,000 from the end of the third quarter of 2015.","Now, restructuring costs in 2015 and 2016 have been about $1.9 billion, and our outlook today anticipates an additional $500 million in 2017. Now, if you add that up, that's a bit more than what we said in that release, and that's because a little of it was actually for programs that predated that announcement. And since then, we've actually done more. Just as an example, we announced the shutdown of our on-highway truck business earlier in 2016, and that was not something we had previously anticipated. So costs are a little bit more than we had talked about that September.","The flip side of that, though, is savings appear to be quite higher. So if you take out short-term incentive comp, that's really not cost reduction related to any of the actions that we've taken, and so it's not fair to count the benefit of that. So if you take that out, at the end of 2016, we had taken out about $1.5 billion from our period cost structure since 2014.","And we \u2013 to go to the next page, page 11, we're expecting more reduction in our cost structure, again, not including inflation and short-term incentive of about another $500 million this year. So that means by the time we get to the end of 2017, we'll be looking for our period cost structure to be down a couple billion dollars, which is a bit more than we said in the third quarter of 2015, and that's because we're doing more than we anticipated then.","Now, all those numbers both on the cost side and the estimated benefit side, they do not include two large facilities that we're currently contemplating. We've announced both of these: Gosselies, Belgium; and Aurora, Illinois. If those two actions end up moving forward, they would add both to restructuring costs and potential benefits. So that's a recap on restructuring. Actually, quite a bit of progress there.","So if we move on to page 12, just a few points on the outlook, and Jim touched on this earlier. Our outlook for next year has sales in a range of $36 billion to $39 billion. The midpoint of that is about a $1 billion lower than 2016. We are actually seeing a number of positive signals. Commodity prices over the course of the past year have risen, and that's good. If we get any continued improvement and any stabilization, I think that's important. That would be a positive for several of our businesses.","In particular, gas compression has remained very strong. Solar had another good year this year and they have a strong backlog as we start 2017. Construction in China has been positive, and that's good. But that said, it's dependent upon continued economic growth and government support for construction in China as we go into 2017.","And then, Construction \u2013 this might sound a little backwards, but Construction sales in other developing countries like Brazil, for example, are at extremely low levels. Brazil, in particular, it's way off where we were a couple of years ago. They've been involved in a pretty deep recession there, and with any kind of recovery, there certainly would be upside there.","Now, in terms of concerns, and we talked about these in the release, mining customers, our estimates and what we've read, we're not seeing \u2013 we're seeing better sentiment, for sure, but we're not seeing expectations for a big increase in CapEx in 2017, although it does look like that could occur in 2018. We've had weakness in North American construction over the past year. There's been a lot of used equipment in the market. The slide in oil and gas over the last couple of years has been a negative for our sales.","Economic growth in Europe, it's actually been not too bad. Our sales in Europe over the last year or so have been okay, but Brexit is still a risk. It's not happened yet, and so I think we have to count that as a concern. And then for next year, it looks to us like rail, marine, power gen and industrial engine sales are going to be down.","So that's all just a little summarization of the sales outlook. The profit outlook for next year is $2.30 all-in including restructuring, and about $2.90 at an adjusted level. And the only thing that's being adjusted out of that is restructuring costs, and those would be at the midpoint of the sales and revenues outlook.","So let's move on to 13, which is our last page and then we'll jump into the Q&A. Our 2007 (sic) [2017] outlook we think is pretty consistent with what we said in early December. We \u2013 at that point, we made a statement that said that the $38 billion outlook that was in consensus we thought was pretty reasonable. Since then, we've had a bit of currency movement, and so there's a bit of translation on sales that have caused us to peg the outlook at $37.5 billion. But that's not a result of any change in any of the underlying fundamentals the way we see the marketplace. We've had good operational performance, and we've talked about this quite a bit already, in particular, on cost reduction. We're on track with our restructuring actions, and we maintain a pretty strong balance sheet.","Our debt-to-cap ratio is within our targeted range for ME&T of 41%. We generated good positive ME&T operating cash flow in 2016, which was more than enough to cover the dividend and CapEx, and we would expect that to continue in 2017. And we ended the year with a cash balance over $7 billion, so that's good as well.","So with that, Kate, we're ready to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today is coming from Nicole Deblase. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thanks. It's Deutsche Bank. Good morning, guys.","Bradley M. Halverson - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So I guess starting with the revenue outlook, I know you gave some color about this in December, but the year-on-year decline that you are forecasting, what are you embedding by segment? Is it similar across all three segments, or are there certain segments where the decline is going to be steeper?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yes. Good question. First off, the decline is not very much, it's $1 billion. Roughly half of that is currency translation related, not an industry or volume decline. And of what's left probably the most significant decline is in Energy & Transportation. Again, it's not a lot, but like on my last slide I talked about Transportation being weaker. So we see a bit of a decline in rail and marine. Power gen, particularly in the Mideast has been tough and industrial engines down a little bit for Ag and loose engines we sell to gen set packagers.","So probably of the piece that's not currency translation is probably a little heavier E&T. Construction, we would see as relatively flat, and our Resource Industries, I think the mining part of it should be pretty close to flat. And we're still a little pessimistic on large construction equipment which come out of Resource Industries. We had quite a bit of rental load and a higher level of sales in late 2015 and throughout much of the first half of 2017 and that's kind of tailed off in the second half of \u2013 I'm sorry, 2016, tailed off in the last half of 2016 and we are not overly optimistic about that in 2017. So I hope that helps, Nicole.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. That's really helpful, Mike, and just for my follow-up, I guess thinking about restructuring costs, you are stepping up your efforts again in 2017, $500 million. I know that there's those two plants that you talked about that could actually present upside to that, but do you see additional restructuring actions coming through in 2018, or do you think that we're coming to the end of the restructuring initiative?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, you never want to say never. I mean, we did more in 2016 than we had expected when we announced the big program in late 2015. So it's hard to say that nothing else would come up. I mean, you don't have a crystal ball. I think much of what is actually in 2017 as a cost is just a continuation of the things that are already in flight. And the two things \u2013 the two that we announced that we're contemplating, Aurora and Gosselies, would certainly add to that some in 2017 and probably still some in 2018.","But beyond that, on the books right now, there's nothing else substantial that we're contemplating that hasn't happened. But, again, I certainly wouldn't want to try to make it sound like that's an ironclad nothing else will come up, and nothing else will happen. You just don't know what the world's going to do. But those two items would be \u2013 other than the things that are already in flight, the only big new things that are currently on the horizon.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Mike. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Gilardi. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Bank of America. Just a couple questions, guys. Just first on Construction, it's great to see the pricing flattening out, which has been a big headwind this year, but your closest competitor in North America is out there guiding to a 3.5% margin, and basically lost money last quarter, and you guys are still putting up 9.3%, which \u2013 more power to you for that, but you're flagging ongoing challenges in the North American market. I mean, is the issue that you just need to cut production a lot more aggressively to rebalance where we are in the U.S., because I would think given all the headwinds you've flagged that your margins would be a lot lower right now than they actually are?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Let me try to address that, Ross. We're not looking for major declines in North America next year. On balance, Construction looks \u2013 our Construction industry segment looks fairly neutral year-to-year. Our view is that the Middle East and North America will be a little softer, and Asia Pacific may be up a little, but we're not signaling some large continuing decline. I wouldn't want to give you that impression whatsoever. And we have a range out there. And you never know if economic growth is faster than we think, if tax reform comes sooner, if infrastructure spending comes sooner, maybe we can be towards the high end. So I don't want to make it sound like we're super negative on Construction, because that's not the case.","In terms of the margins, I'm not sure what our competitors are doing, but I can tell you we've been out there working the cost reduction pretty substantially in Construction, in E&T and in Resource Industries and in Corporate elements. I mean, we've been taking out costs pretty aggressively. And I think that that has contributed to the Construction margins that you see. I don't think there's production that needs to be cut substantially to make it better. Dealers took out inventory in the fourth quarter about the same as they normally do, about the same as they took out in the prior year. So I think inventories are in reasonable shape. I think production is in reasonable shape. And when a little volume comes back, I think those margins will go up.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you, Mike. And then just my follow-up is on the backlog and the sequential pickup that you noted in Construction and Resources. Resources has obviously been through a tough time for many years, but on Construction, is that a seasonal move, or could you give any more color on where that's coming from? Are you seeing an actual pickup in order intake in North America? Or anything you can provide there would be helpful.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, we did. Actually, we had decent orders in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we built backlog, and they were up from prior year reasonable double digits. So that's a good sign, but between \u2013 that's machines, that's RI and CI. So that's good. Hopefully, that'll continue.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Well, thanks very much, Mike, for everything and best of luck on your retirement.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Ross. Looking forward to it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning. It's Goldman Sachs, and congratulations, Mike. It's been really nice working with you.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm wondering if you could talk about the timing of the final decision on the Aurora and Belgian facilities. And separately, can you talk about the cost reduction carryover that you expect in 2018 from actions that'll be completed this year?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, on the first one, we will just take them separately. With Aurora, we need to provide between the time of our announcement and the time that it's kind of finalized, we need to provide time for the local unions to look at it and see if there's anything they can do to contribute to that. I mean you have a waiting period there. And in Belgium, it's a little bit kind of the same way except the government is involved in addition to the local unions. So we'll hopefully get the decisions made on both of those as soon as we can.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And, Mike...","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Oh \u2013 go ahead. What was the second part of that again, Ross?","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","It's Jerry, Mike. The second part of the question was the carryover benefit 2018 versus 2017 from the restructuring actions that will be completed this year?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yes. We have about $500 million of period cost reductions in for next year, and a lot of that is carryover from the actions taken this year.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sorry, so that's $500 million carryover 2018 versus 2017?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, we have $500 million of additional period cost reduction next year, and again, that doesn't include a little labor inflation and incentive pay. Outside of those two items, we have our period cost coming down $500 million, and what I'm saying is a decent part of that would be carryover from actions that we took in 2016.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Sorry, Mike, the question was on 2018 versus 2017. Are you able to comment on it?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, I don't have \u2013 I mean, certainly 2018 would definitely be higher in terms of benefits from restructuring. But at this point, we don't have a number for 2018.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","And it will depend on what happens in Aurora and Gosselies and whether or not a decision actually gets made to close them or not.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eli Lustgarten. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Longbow Securities. Good morning, everyone, and welcome, Jim, to our club and we are going to miss you, Mike, but that's what happens when you get to middle age, I guess.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","You're probably the only guy on today that's actually older than me.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Probably. Don't remind me. Just a couple. You went through the segment outlook by revenue or the impact from the low sales. Can you talk a little bit about profitability? Your press release says that you expect dealers to take less inventory out in 2017 than 2016. Does that hold up the Construction margins, so margins basically could be similar or up a little bit? Same thing with the lower volume coming and the impact in Energy & Transportation and how weak should we expect that to get or is that just take the 30% flow-through that you suggest and how close can Resources get towards the breakeven level given the outlook that is taking place?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good questions, Eli. On dealer inventory, I talked a little bit about 2016 and 2015. For 2017, in reality, when we get towards the end of the year, what's actually going to happen with dealer inventory will depend a lot on how dealers feel about 2018, I mean, you could paint a scenario with, again, tax reform and infrastructure spending and lesser regulation and more investment in energy. If all that happens, maybe dealers will be more bullish about 2018 and want to add inventory. So it's a little bit hard at this juncture to get very definitive about that.","And I would say in our sales forecast, right now, again, we're looking for each of the segments to not be far from flat. I mean, E&T down a bit on volume, RI down a little bit on volume. We're counting on a little more cost reduction, but the flip side of that is we do have a pretty sizable increase in incentive pay. And cost reduction and incentive pay is kind of universal across the company, so I wouldn't expect big variations in each of the segments.","You specifically asked about RI profitability. They have \u2013 relative to their sales, they've done a lot of cost reduction. And given where their sales are, I won't comment on whether they're right at or more or less breakeven at the sales level, but it would be pretty close. I mean, it's \u2013 they're not far from breakeven at what's in the outlook for next year, which is 2016 probably minus a couple hundred million. So they're getting pretty close, and it's a result of a lot of good work on cost reduction, a lot of capacity \u2013 or not capacity, floor space taken out, a lot of head count reduction.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And just a quick follow-up. What our surveys show when we talk to Cat dealers is they are extremely optimistic about end markets, but most of the dealers have indicated that because of the uncertainty that we talk about because of politics that they are planning to age their rental fleet this year waiting for more definitive action. Are you seeing any of that or hearing that, that the problems with the construction industry, if there is a problem this year in the U.S. is more on the rental side than it is in the end-user side?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, certainly, on some of the larger construction equipment, we had a higher rental load in \u2013 earlier in 2016. So I think we see that being down a little bit, particularly on large product. But I think the sentiment is what's important, not so much just the dealer \u2013 or the rental fleet age point. I think it's \u2013 there are a lot of positive signals out there, but it's not really turned into higher equipment sales yet. And I think it's \u2013 there's still a bit to play out. But I think we see and we hear the sort of general optimism about end markets. We hear that as well. Quoting activity, orders a little bit have been more positive in RI. And again, those are longer lead times, so it's probably more of a 2018 story than a 2017 story. But yeah, I think we sense more optimism.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","It's Barclays, and good morning. My question is on Solar really. If you look across Caterpillar, you've got a lot of businesses that are well below normal troughs, whether you want to do Brazil, as you mentioned, or Resources or locomotives probably in the U.S. or just a bunch of them. And Solar is probably the one that's hung on and you mentioned that the backlog was pretty good in the press release. But could you give a sense as you look at permitting, or you look at pipeline activity a couple years out, or you think about how much you have delivered into offshore oil this year that maybe was specced out two years or three years ago? Do you feel like you are still at risk of having that business slide or is it just at the right level when you \u2013 not just the backlog, but when you look at the activity level further out?","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah, this is Jim Umpleby. I'll take that one. If you think about Solar's business, there's a variety of elements to it. One is \u2013 and we talked about earlier on the call is the gas compression business in North America. And that business has continued to be quite strong, and people will often look at the CapEx in the pipeline industry and try to make a correlation with Solar's business.","While there is some correlation, I'd urge caution there because much of the CapEx is driven by new pipeline construction, and much of Solar's sales into gas compression in North America is adding horsepower to existing pipelines. So Solar can still have a strong level of business and it wouldn't necessarily be reflected in the macro level CapEx number for the industry.","So Solar's business, again, gas compression has hung in there. Their oil-related businesses, generally gas turbine driven gen sets for offshore oil and gas production facilities, has been down for some time, just given for obvious reasons with the decline in oil prices. Their customer services business, of course, Solar is a direct business. They handle both the parts and the service directly, and that business has been relatively stable as well. So I think to put it all together, it's not a situation where Solar has been living off of backlogs for oil, like you mentioned. It's really been a strong gas compression story. And again, we think that business is stable.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much. That's great. And, Mike, congratulations and well deserved. Thanks.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. JPMorgan and same thoughts from me here, Mike. I'm jealous. Anyway, my question is more related to the new administration and if you could \u2013 you gave us on slide 12 the positives and the concerns with regard to what you are looking at as you move into 2017 from a sales and profitability standpoint, but could you create two buckets of the new administration and what the net positives you might be contemplating versus the net negatives? We think of things like what if net interest expense goes away, what does that do to your financial services business? What does a strong dollar do? Are you a net exporter? If you could just break down two buckets for us, that would be fantastic.","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Hi, Ann. This is Jim Umpleby. I'll take part of that. As we look at what's happening in the conversation in Washington both within the administration and Congress, there's a number of things that we're very encouraged by. We've long been an advocate for, of course, infrastructure. You know the infrastructure in the U.S. is in dire need of maintenance and modernization. And we are very encouraged by the bipartisan support for much needed infrastructure bill. It would be good for both the country and for Caterpillar. Obviously, there is timing issues there in terms of if in fact that happens, and when it could occur.","We are also encouraged by discussions around taxes. We've been a longstanding advocate for overhaul in the U.S. tax code. Many of our competitors, of course, are outside the United States and we need a tax policy in the U.S. that puts us on a level playing field, so we can compete fairly. So again, we are encouraged by that as well. Smart regulations, again, another positive thing. So, again, generally all in given the conversations that are going on in Washington, we think it's positive for economic growth, jobs growth, and we are encouraged by that.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Ann, you made a point about FX currency and again...","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Can you talk a little bit about the risks, if net interest expensing goes away, if the dollar strengthens, what that does to competitiveness? Are you a net exporter? A little bit more balanced view, if you like.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. So I would just add a couple of things to Jim. One, we have a cost structure that's spread around the world, so \u2013 and you can see that in today's release. Well, actually, there was not a lot of movement, but over the last few quarters. The moving value of the U.S. dollar, it can change our sales, translate into more or less. But from a translation standpoint, we have a lot of costs outside the U.S. as well as sales. So it has not had that big an impact on our financial results. So that's been a good thing and the result of work-over will be 40 years to diversify the currency that the cost base is in. So I think, to a large degree, currency doesn't have too huge an impact. Now, certainly, there are some competitive impacts, like Komatsu if they're producing more in Japan and exporting to the U.S. So a particularly strong dollar against the yen can impact competitiveness, but in the ranges that we're at now, it's not something that's abnormal.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, Mike. Thanks. I appreciate that, but really what I was getting at is would you be willing to share whether Cat is a net exporter?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely, we're a net exporter. Absolutely, no doubt.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And net interest expensing on the FinCo?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Sorry. I don't know the answer to that, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. No problem. I'll leave it there. Thank you and best wishes.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Evercore ISI. First question, the sales cadence for 2017 in the context of the down 3% or so midpoint, do you see a quarter in 2017 where sales turn positive and if you maybe kind of give us some idea if you think it's midyear or late in the year? Just some perspective.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. I think if you look at the things we mentioned in the release and I've kind of talked about today, I think you can probably get your mind around the idea that the second half of the year probably has the most upside. All the things that we've talked about, tax reform, better economic growth. That's certainly not impacting what's on the books, getting produced and shipped here early in the year. In fact, probably for the first quarter, I think you can play into your first quarter thoughts. Basically kind of what's happening for the year will probably happen for the first quarter, so sales down a little, profit down a little versus a year ago. So I think if there's upside, it'll probably come later in the year, particularly if we start seeing better economic growth, we get tax reform kind of nailed down so people actually know what's coming. The more that happens, the sooner the better.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","And then regarding the segment margins. I mean, the framework here is you're saying sales are down 3%, EPS is down 15%, right, excluding extraordinary items?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Right. Yeah.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","And thinking of it as an equipment company, Cat financials probably say it's worth 4% of that down 15%. Tax rate, up a little bit is worth, call it, 1%.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Right.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","So we're still saying the equipment company is down 3%; EBIT basically implied about down 10%. But when you think about your comments on Resource Industries, you're saying they will cut their losses. You didn't say break even, but you said, call it, losing $150 million. And if CI margins then are flat on flat revs, it is implying a pretty big decremental on E&T. So just so we walk off the call understanding, I guess, really the interplay between RI and the E&T, are we saying the E&T margins are down fairly notably?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","No. We didn't provide any guidance on any margin by segment. I was just kind of reacting to, on RI, is it going to be at breakeven? My comment was probably not \u2013 but probably not far from it.","And another point, David, and this doesn't really relate to your question but I just wanted to \u2013 of all the year-end adjustments that we had, the one that was included in segment margins was the goodwill adjustment. And I know you know that. So we have about 30% decrementals for the company next year on the lower sales, and we a have higher tax rate, as you mentioned. Those two items \u2013 and the 30% decremental is a little bit higher than we've had over the last couple of years, and that's mostly because we have a lot more incentive comp. I mean, we paid very little this year and you know how that is a little bit of a moving target. Each year, it kind of gets reset at the beginning of the year. So at this point, that is a headwind for next year. And outside of that, I think margins will be overall fairly similar to last year.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Well, that's what I'm saying. I'm not trying to paint a rosy picture here on your guidance, but it doesn't seem \u2013 if you get any RI improvement and given all the restructuring...","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","...and even take your comment of not quite breakeven but again, let's say we lose $150 million. You would think CI profits should be steady versus a flat sales. So we're saying the hit on the EBIT's got to be E&T. And I'm not sure why the hit should be that big.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. Again, we've not provided any separate guidance on any of the segment margins. And remember that incentive pay is going to be a headwind for all of them.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Okay. I appreciate it. And good luck, Mike. I appreciate it.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Okay, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. Credit Suisse. And congrats, Mike. I get the sense that we will miss you more than you will miss us and also congratulations, Jim. I guess two questions, one for Mike and one for Jim. Jim, I guess as you sit here as the new CEO, can you talk about sort of your approach to guidance relative to Cat historically and how we should think about that and the precedent that you want to set here coming in as the new CEO?","And then I guess my follow-up question, Mike or Jim, because you will know this as well, on the oil and gas side, you guys talked about Solar and the visibility that you have there, but what are you seeing on the reciprocating engine side? I know orders had been down dramatically. I'm just wondering if we are seeing any improvement there or quoting activity. Any color you could provide. Thank you.","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","Good morning, Jamie. First part of your question, our outlook is based on input we receive from customers, dealers, market trends. Maybe the short answer to your question is it's not our intent to be overly optimistic or pessimistic. We'll hit it down the middle of the fairway, to use a golf analogy, and give you our best view based on all the various inputs that we receive.","In terms of your oil and gas question, we expect our recip business to be up slightly. As you know, there was a lot of carnage in that industry over the last few years. A lot of equipment was stacked. But we are seeing more activity in that area which is positive, but we'll have to wait and see how it all plays out. Stability of oil prices is very important, and it would certainly help to have the price go up a bit more.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All righty. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Andy, do we have you?","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, sorry about that.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","No problem.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Couldn't miss an opportunity to say goodbye, Mike. Good luck.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","It's been a long time.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, no kidding. And welcome, Jim. A question on the flattish pricing in Construction. Is that a reflection of the competitive environment getting less aggressive, the year-over-year comps getting easier, or is it potentially a shift in how the company is looking at the balance between profitability and market share?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Well, that is a very good question. And I guess in some ways, it's probably a little bit of all of it. We had, I would say, better comps. If you look at the pricing environment, it's \u2013 I wouldn't be saying that it's gotten better or it's easier or competitors are out there raising prices. That's not the case. It was worse in total, I don't remember what the separate number was for the year, but for the company for the year we were well over $700 million-ish negative.","I think what's happened is that stabilized. It doesn't look like it's getting any worse. I don't think the pricing environment is any better on an absolute basis, but we don't see it getting kind of worse from here. We do use our operating and execution model, and you don't want to be doing silly things. You don't want to, for example, have big sales discounts on products you don't make much money on. So I think we're trying to have the owning \u2013 or the operating and execution model guide us on where to spend our money on sales variance and discounting. But I think the main answer to your question is the comps have kind of started to flatten out.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And then a separate question on Resource Industries. You mentioned the parts demand continued to sequentially increase. Did you see that same sort of sequential increase in rebuild activity? And then for the backlog improvement, can you talk about if that was concentrated in a particular region or more broad-based?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Yeah. So I don't get actual reporting on rebuild, but I can tell you for RI rebuild is the major driver of \u2013 or is a major driver of parts sales. So if I had to speculate here, I would say the answer to that is probably yes, because that's a good driver of parts sales. And I don't think there's been enough of an increase in the backlog for regional differences to matter that much. And I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I did look at them, and it wasn't enough for me to say, ah, we need to make this point that it was all here or here. So probably nothing yet there to get too excited about.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks and good luck, Mike.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.","Okay. So I think we are going to stop the Q&A there for a moment. I want to turn the floor. We have a couple minutes left. I want to turn the floor back over to our CEO, Jim Umpleby, for some closing comments.","D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Mike.

I'd like to begin today by thanking our global team for delivering an outstanding year in 2018. It was the best profit per share performance in our company's history, which allowed us to return $5.8 billion of capital to shareholders. In 2018 we remained focused on making our customers more successful and executing our enterprise strategy, which centers around achieving long term profitable growth through operational excellence and investing in services and expanded offerings. ","Revenue for the year was up 20% to $54.7 billion as favorable economic conditions drove growth across many of our end markets. We delivered record adjusted profit per share of $11.22 and strong operating cash flow of $6.3 billion, which allowed us to repurchase $3.8 billion of company stock, raise the dividend by 10% and make a discretionary pension contribution of $1 billion. 2018 marks the 25th consecutive year we paid higher dividends to our shareholders, earnings us recognition as a member of the elite Aristocrat\u2019s Dividend Fund. ","Our fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 13.8%. This was lower than our expectations and was impacted primarily by right-offs at Cat Financial and higher than expected material and freight costs. ","However our full year 2018 adjusted operating margin was 15.9%, 340 basis points higher than 2017 and solidly in line with our Investor Day target range. We are continuing to execute our enterprise strategy with the operating and execution model guiding our investments to those areas with the best opportunity for future profitable growth. ","I\u2019ve talked frequently about two components of the strategy, expanded offerings and services. Let me walk you through a few successes from last year in both of those areas. On our October call I talked about our expanded offerings as next generation Articulated Trucks and Mini Excavators. We\u2019ve continued to roll out next-gen machines, including the 120Motor Grader that offers up to 15% greater fuel efficiency and saves customers up to 15% in maintenance cost with new Filtration Technology. ","In December we announced the next generation 36-ton Class Excavators. These machines increase operating efficiency, lower fuel and maintenance costs and improve operator comfort. We also launched our next generation D6 dozer offering customers the world's first high drive electric drive Dozer with 35% better fuel efficiency and increased agility compared to the previous electric drive models. ","We are expanding our engine offerings as well, including the CG Series of Generator Sets, increasing power output, offering high reliability and improving return on investment for our customers as they operate on natural gas and bio-gas, making them more economical. ","Thanks to the combination of Caterpillar Technology and the customer's initiative, the world's first Cruise Ship power by liquefied natural gas set sale in 2018. This is another great example of an expanded offering. We offered our customer an integrated solution utilizing our MaK Dual Fuel engines to fully operate this cruise ship using LNG. ","Now a few examples of services, including technology solutions that support our dealers and customers at the initial point of sale and in the aftermarket. As of November Cat Mining Trucks used in our MineStar command for hauling Autonomous Technology reached a milestone of moving 1 billion tons of material. We deployed our first six commercial autonomous trucks in 2013 and the fleet now has grown to more than 150.","Six different mining companies are operating command for hauling on sites in Australia, in North and South America. We are working with customers who operate mixed fleets and have successfully deployed our Autonomous Technology to rectorfix competitive haul trucks.","We are leveraging our success with autonomy and are collaborating with a customer to pilot remote control operative stations for landfill operations, which could transform even revolutionize many aspects of the landfill industry. We've also introduced an equipment management app that allows our customers to monitor fleet data, request parts and service, and connect with their dealer via mobile devices. ","These are a few of the many examples of our global team helping our customers be more successful working with Caterpillar than with any of our competitors.","Now for the outlook: Following a record year in 2018, we expect further growth in profit per share in 2019 to a range of $11.75 to $12.75. Our outlook assumes a modest sales increase based on the fundamentals of our diverse end markets, as well as macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. We will continue to focus on operational excellence, including cost discipline while investing in expanded offerings and services to drive long term profitable growth. ","In Construction Industries we believe the healthy U.S. economy, continued pipeline construction and state and local funding for infrastructure development will be favorable in 2019. Latin America is expected to continue its recovery, but demand will remain at relatively low levels. ","In the Europe, Africa Middle East region demand remained steady, but political and economic uncertainty exits. In Asia Pacific we expect construction growth in countries outside of China. Within China, the industry is very dynamic and there are a variety of forecasts. We will continue to monitor the situation, but as of now we are forecasting the overall China market to be roughly flat in 2019 following two years of significant growth. China represents about 10% to 15% of our total construction industry sales and about 5% to 10% of total Caterpillar sales and revenues. ","For Resource Industries, we believe commodity prices will remain supportive for investment and mining companies will increase their CapEx budgets in 2019. Demand for heavy construction in quarry and aggregate equipment should also remain strong. ","In energy and transportation we expect the recent volatility in oil prices and takeaway constraints in the Permian to negatively impact demand for well servicing equipment in the first part of the year. ","Gas compression should remain strong. Demand for power generation equipment should continue positive momentum that started in 2018. For industrial engines, the strong U.S. economy remains a positive for demand, but we expect some headwinds in EAME. Finally in transportation, we expect our rail business to improve in 2019. ","In summary, 2018 was an excellent year for Caterpillar and one that demonstrates the power of our strategy. We achieved record profit per share, returned significant capital to shareholders and continued investment in expanded offerings and services to drive long term profitable growth. ","Once again, I'd like to thank our global team. Now that 2018 is in the record books, we are focused on delivering another great year. We continue to feel good about our business and it increased out profit outlook for 2019. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew. ","Andrew Bonfield","Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. This year's record profits and strong cash flows are a clear reflection of the hard work and cost discipline that stems from the company's focus on delivering a strategy using the operating and execution model. ","Today I\u2019m going to walk through at a high level both the quarter and full year 2019 results and then I will discuss our outlook and highlight some of the key financial assumptions for 2019. So please turn to slide 5, to look at the results for Q4. ","Sales and revenues were $14.3 billion, up 11% from last year, with continued growth across all regions and in all three primary segments. Increased demand for resource industries machines, higher sales in North America for construction equipment and higher demand for reciprocating engines to support well servicing and gas compression applications in North America were all significant drivers of this increase. ","Fourth quarter profit per share of $1.78 and adjusted profit per share of $2.55 were both up from the year ago. You will recall that in 2017 profit per share was impacted by U.S. tax reform. The 18% increase to adjusted profit per share year-over-year was largely driven by the higher sales volume along with continued cost discipline. ","If you move to slide six, I will walk through the 36% increase in operating profit. As you can see from the chart, the operating profit contribution of the higher sales volume was most of the $496 million operating profit increase in the quarter. Price realization was $179 million or about 1% higher than the fourth quarter of last year.","Positive price realization was offset by higher manufacturing costs, largely due to high material and fright costs, as steel prices, tariffs and supply chain inefficiencies continue to impact our results. Financial products had a $73 million negative impact on operating profits for the quarter. I will walk through this in more detail when I cover that segment. ","Lastly, restructuring costs were favorable by $144 million as restructuring actions continue to ram down and are expected to return to normalized levels next year, which is why we will no longer exclude them from the adjusted profit per share calculation. ","In short, whilst there are several puts and takes, price continues to largely offset CAT cost headwinds, dealer costs remain about flat and higher sales volume will remain as the primary driver of the improvement in operating profit. However, we did see a decline in operating margins in the quarter versus year-to-date run rates. ","Also a decline in the operating margin is typical in the fourth quarter. This year it was greater than we expected and resulted from unplanned allowance increases and write-downs in financial products, higher manufacturing costs including higher material and freight costs, as well as inventory changes. The negative impact from inventory occurred as inventory increase throughout the year and came slightly down in the fourth quarter, resulting in unfavorable operating leverage. ","Now let's look at the performance of each segment in Q4, beginning in the construction industries on slide 7. Sales were $5.7 billion, an increase of $410 million or 8%. Construction sales increased in North America and EAME, but were down slightly in Asia-Pac and Latin America. ","The sales increase in North America was $403 million, driving nearly all of the construction industry sales growth for the quarter. We believe the North American economy remains robust with much of the increase driven by oil and gas related projects, including pipelines and other non-residential construction activities. ","In addition to higher end user demand, dealer inventories also increased in North America. This increase follows several quarters of tight dealer inventory levels and we now believe it now better aligned to meet current demand.","In EAME sales in the region were up 9% as strong end user demand in Europe for infrastructure, road and nonresidential construction was partially offset by continued weakness in the Middle East. ","Asia Pacific sales were down 4% or $64 million. The sales decline was driven by lower demand in China, partially offset by higher sales in other Asian countries. While sales were down in China in the quarter, this was in part due to an unusual seasonal pattern in Q4, 2017, with a more \u2013 return to a more normal pattern in 2018. ","I will remind you how strong the last two years have been with industry sales for 10 ton and above excavators up about 40% in 2018 after doubling in 2017. Lastly, several Latin American countries continue to experience economic challenges. Sales were down $18 million or about 5% for the region. ","Turning to profit, CI\u2019s segment profit was about flat versus a year ago with an operating margin of 14.8% down 100 basis points. The favorable impacts of high price realization and improved sales volume were about offset by higher material, labor and freight costs, as well as adverse variable manufacturing costs. ","The sequential decline in operating margins from the third quarter run rate was largely driven by higher material costs and higher variable manufacturing costs. Construction Industries backlog was up for the quarter and from a year ago as higher production levels supported an increase in order rates. Most CI equipment remains on managed distribution. ","Now let\u2019s go to slide eight and look at Resource Industries. RI sales were $2.8 billion, up 21% from the fourth quarter 2017. Higher sales in the quarter were driven by robust demand from heavy construction and quarry and aggregate customers, as well as higher shipments, machines to mining customers as mining companies increase capital expenditures. ","Demand for aftermarket parts to overhaul maintain equipment remained robust in the quarter. The decline in resource industries backlog was the result of several factors, including the lumpiness of mining orders and an increase in dealer inventory. Based on activities we are seeing in the market, we expect the slowdown in orders to be temporary and are expecting high mining CapEx in 2019 to drive high new equipment sales for the segment. ","Segment profit of $400 million was up an impressive 90% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Segment operating margin improved to 14.3% up 520 basis from 2017. RIs improved performance and margin expansion was primarily due to higher sales. The operating leverage came through several years of significant restructuring actions and the teams continued cost discipline. These gains were partially offset by higher material and freight costs in the quarter. ","Now let\u2019s turn to slide nine where we will discuss energy and transportation. E&T sales in the fourth quarter were $6.3 billion a 11% higher than the same quarter last year. Sales into oil and gas applications were up by $222 million or 15%, a strength in onshore activity in North America for reciprocating gas compression and well servicing applications continued. ","Sales for turbines and turbine-related services were about flat. Power generation sales increased by $211 million or 20%, driven primarily by sales of reciprocating engines to support data center and other large power generation projects. Industrial application sales were about flat with higher sales in North American and Asia Pacific, about offset by lower sales in Latin America and the EAME. ","Transportation sales were up by 10%, driven primarily by acquisitions of two rail services businesses into January 2018. Segment profit for energy and transportation was $1.08 billion, up $205 million or 23% from the fourth quarter of last year. The signal margin improved by 170 basis points to 17.2%. ","E&Ts profit improvement was mostly due to the higher sales volume, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs including freight. E&Ts backlog was down from the third quarter, but up when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. ","The growth in the backlog year-over-year is primarily attributed to higher turbine and reciprocating engine demand. About half the backlog decline in the quarter was related to large shipments for both recip engines and turbines. Another half resulted from the slowdown of orders to support oil and gas applications in light of recent oil price volatility. ","Please move to slide 10 and I\u2019ll walk through what caused the decline in financial products profitability in the quarter. Financial products fourth quarter profit was $29 million down $204 million form Q4 of 2017. More than 85% of the unfavorable change was due to the impacts from equity securities and the insurance services investment portfolio, and continued weakness with a small number of accounts and the CAT Power Finance portfolio. ","Unfavorable impact from insurance services was more than half of the change and was due to a $44 million mark-to-market loss in the fourth quarter of 2018, combined with the absence of a $68 million investment gain from the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding these non-core impacts that are not indicative of the profit from ongoing business, insurance services would have been possible with operating margin performance consistent with historical averages. ","The unfavorable change from the CAT Power Finance portfolio was due to an increase in the provision for credit losses, primarily from a $72 million unfavorable impact due to an increase in the allowance rate, and an increase in write-offs of $13 million. ","Cat Financials core asset portfolio continues to perform well. Excluding Cat Power Finance, Cat Financials key credit quality metrics are in line with historical averages for past dues, write-offs and the allowance rate. A strategic assessment of Cat Power Finance was conducted in early 2018, which resulted in changes to the risk management of the portfolio. This includes working down the balance of old loans to reduce exposure and that worker is substantially progressed. We have also significantly reduced our risk exposure going forward and have timed our lending criteria to reduce risks. ","Now let\u2019s quickly recap the year on slide 11. As we look back, 2018 was a year of solid strategy execution, production increases across most of our product lines, disciplined cost control, investments and profitable growth initiatives and record profit per share. ","For the year, sales and revenue of $54.7 billion were up 20% from 2017. Profit per share for the full year was $10.26 versus $1.26 in 2017. Adjusted profit per share was $11.22 up 63% from 2017s adjusted profit per share of $6.88. ","Please turn to slide 12 and I\u2019ll walk you through the operating profit for the full year 2018. Operating profit was $8.3 billion, up 86% from $4.5 billion. The most significant driver to operating margins was high sales volume, with sales in revenues up about$ 9.2 billion or 20%, representing sales growth across all three primary segments and in all geographic regions. ","It was another good year for price realization up $601 million or 1.2%. For the company price realization more than offset manufacturing cost increases, which were primarily a result of higher material and freight costs. Total SG&A and R&D expenses where higher by $249 million, largely driven by increased investments and initiatives to support profitable growth in services and expanded offerings. ","Financial products were unfavorable by $141 million, largely due to the absence of gains from the sale of securities, unfavorable impacts from the move to mark-to-market accounting for equity securities and weakness in the Cat Power Finance and Latin American portfolios. Restructuring costs were favorable by $833 million, largely due to the absence of expenses related to a European facility closure in 2017. ","On slide 13 you can see the significant improvements in adjusted operating margins across the enterprise and the all three primary segments. These improvements were largely driven by higher sales volumes and continued cost discipline, which enabled us to meet or exceed the ranges we committed to at our 2017 Invested Day. Adjusted operating margin for the enterprise was 15.9%, 340 basis points higher than 2017 with significant improvement in each segment. ","Now let\u2019s move on to slide 14 to discuss cash flow. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and $7.9 billion of enterprise cash. ME&T operating cash flow was $2.5 billion in the quarter and $6.3 billion for the full year and during the year the Board raised the dividend per share by 10%. ","In addition, given our financial position and strong cash flows, we bought back $1.8 billion of company stock in the fourth quarter bring our full year stock buyback to $3.8 billion. Lastly we were also able to make a $1 billion discretionary pension contribution in the third quarter. ","In summary, we returned $5.8 billion of capital to shareholders and ended the year with an entry price cash balance down just slightly from a year ago. It is this strong cash generation which is a result of the discipline created by the O&E model that is one of the most impressive outcomes of 2018. I will update you more on our refreshed capital allocation framework during the 2019 investor day we expect hold in Clayton, North Carolina on May 2. ","Now let\u2019s move to slide 15 and I\u2019ll walk through our assumptions for the 2018 outlook. Our profit per share outlook range for 2019 is $11.75 to $12.75. This range reflects profit per share up between 5% and 14% over the 2018 adjusted profit per share. Across the outlook range we would expect sales to increase versus 2018. Jim has already taken you through each segment and segments end market assumptions which are summarized on slide four. So I will highlight just a few key financial assumptions. ","Short term incentive compensation will be reset to about $800 million. We expect favorable price realization to be mostly offset by cost headwinds. Restructuring costs are included in the profit per share outlook as they are expected to return to a normalized levels in 2019. ","Financial products profit should revert to historical norms. The outlook assumes that lower share account, driven largely by 2018 stock buybacks, as well as anticipated additional repurchases for 2019. ","We expect to repurchase around $750 million company\u2019s stock in the first quarter of 2019 with the potential for additional share repurchases based on quarterly cash generation and alignment with our capital allocation priorities. We expect a higher tax rate of 26% up 2% from 2018. The increase in the tax rate is largely driven by the application of U.S. Tax Reform provisions to the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which don't have a calendar fiscal year end. These provisions did not apply to these subsidies in 2018. And for your cash flow modeling, we expect ME&T capital expenditures along with CAT inventory to remain about flat. ","Finally let\u2019s turn to slide 16 and recap today\u2019s report. 2018 was a great year with record profit per share. Given our solid balance sheet and strong cash flows, we returned $5.8 billion to shareholders, while increasing our investments to drive profitable growth in services and expanded offering. ","Looking ahead to 2019 we are going to continue the execution about possible go strategy and we are driving to further growth in profit per share. ","With that, I'll hand it back to Amy to begin the Q&A portion of the call. ","Amy Campbell ","Thanks Andrew. Now we will turn it back to Kate to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Please limit your questions to one plus a follow-up.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question. ","Stephen Volkmann","Hi, good morning, it's Jefferies. ","Jim Umpleby","Good morning Steve. ","Stephen Volkmann","I am hoping we can drill down a little bit more on construction industry as that seems to be sort of the biggest point of discussion this morning. Obviously the margin there was somewhat lower than I think most of us were looking for and pretty minimal incremental margin. So it seems like price and costs were sort of a wash if I\u2019m understanding your remarks correctly. So I guess I\u2019m trying to figure out what else was going on there that was sort of a big headwind for the margin and then I'll just throw the follow-up obviously right in there, which is how do we think about that in 2019 from an incremental margin perspective? Thank you. ","Jim Umpleby","Thanks Steve. Obviously the margins were a little bit lower than we anticipated as well when we gave \u2013 when we talked in the third quarter. There were couple of factors underpinning that. One where we did expect a material price actually to exceed manufacturing cost increases in CI. But there is a normal seasonal decline in CI margins, but that was one of the things we expected to partially offset that. That didn't materialize partly because of material cost increases and also because of other manufacturing variances that did occur in the quarter. These included things like the absence of some incentives in Brazil, some variable labor inefficiencies, which were all accumulated to that impact.","As we look forward to 2019 I'll point out a couple of things about CI margins which gives us confidence as we move forward. First of all, we did have \u2013 we put through the price increases on the 1 of January. Obviously that will impact positively on margins and offset some of that weakness that we saw in the fourth quarter; and secondly, we do see the reset of incentive compensation which will have a positive impact as we move through the year.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay, so incremental margins next year and a sort of more normal 25% range or is that a bridge too far? ","Jim Umpleby","We don't give margin guidance by segment, but we do would expect next year to see that construction industries margins will be strong and given the things like the price increase and the incentive compensation, obviously those are our tail winds which should help us improve them.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Timothy Thein. Please note your affiliation and then pose your question. ","Timothy Thein","Good morning; Citigroup. Andrew may be just to follow-up on that the last thread there, just on pricing for the enterprise as a whole, I think you had talked last quarter about a 1% to 4% announced increased to dealers. And just given that sometimes there is a lapse and maybe some of the end market conditions have changed, just how you're thinking about an overall yield relative to that 1% to 4% increase for 2019. ","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah, I mean there are a couple other factors also which are muddy water, so Timjust to remind you obviously the mid-year price increase we have put that through and some of that will also come through into next year as well. Overall though we do expect -- we take into account as Jim said, the macroeconomic environment and geopolitical factors, when we set our guidance range. We do anticipate obviously, but you know you never get 100% to stake, but we do expect good price realization next year and that will offset any manufacturing costs burns as we expect. ","Timothy Thein","Okay, I mean just to pick a midpoint. If I threw 2% out, that's $1 billion. Maybe you think at this point based on what you've seen and commodity markets and just some of your transportation and logistics, experience in recent months, would you expect that level of variable cost inflation or it's just too many moving parts at this point to pin that down?","Andrew Bonfield","I think there are a number of moving parts, but our expectation as I said was the price would offset material cost increases. ","Timothy Thein","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is come from Chad Dillard. Place note your affiliation, then pose your question. ","Chad Dillard ","Hi, good morning; its Deutsche Bank. So just wanted to go back to the tariff discussion. Can you quantify how much impact was in fourth quarter and how you are thinking about how that can better in the 2019 guide and which we can buy in terms of cadence as we go through the year? ","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah, so Chad, its Andrew again. So if you remember the third quarter we talked about the rail and we are expecting to be at the bottom end of the $100 million range. We ended up just over $100 million. Our expectation was at this stage we don't see a rate change in the tariffs, that's our expectation, and obviously you\u2019ve been \u2013 because you would just extrapolate that out based on 12 months versus five months for 2018. ","Chad Dillard ","Great, that's helpful. And then could you provide a little more color on that dealer inventory build. I think we talked about $2.3 billion for 2018 and if you can comment on what you expect that one in 2019 and can you take the entire about out by the full year and? ","A - Andrew Bonfield","Yes, our assumption is obviously as we say or we said consistently, dealer inventory has been constrained and obviously we've you know managed distribution in CI for most of the year. We have seen about a 2 \u2013 as you say, the $2.3 billion increase. Keep in mind that dealers are owned and control their own inventory, so that is based on their expectations. ","We believe that the growth is directly aligned with current market demand and more normal ranges versus historic trends. We expect dealer inventory to be flat. We don't expect any adverse assumptions for the guidance, assuming that there will be no further increase in dealer inventory from our shipments in 2019. ","Chad Dillard ","Great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","David Raso","Hi, Evercore ISI. My question is related to the \u2013 relates to the sales guidance. You're staying up modestly and I'm just trying to get some sense of maybe cadence or where your confidence is from that sales guide. ","The backlog is currently up only 4.4%, the implied orders are up like 2% and if you lose the $2.3 billion of inventory benefit to \u201918, right, you just said inventory is flat, that's over a 4% drag on your sales growth right there, right, from not getting the $2.3 billion that you got \u201918. So can you help us with your comfort level, where you currently are in your order rates, your backlog, that lack of inventory growth in \u201919, that sale should be up modestly everyone can quantify that. ","Jim Umpleby","Yeah, this is Jim. So obviously you know our sales guide is, it depends on a whole variety of factors, but we are in constant contact with our dealers, we look at industry trends, we have a bottoms up process and based on everything that we see, we believe that again sales will be up modestly in 2019. ","We just think about our different market segments and can go around the world. We talked about China a lot and we expect China to be flat after \u2013 you know construction industry is a very good increase. We were up 40% in 2018. The industry demand was up 40% in 2018 after doubling in 2017. ","Oil and gas compression remains strong, both for our recip and solar businesses. We are seeing some weakness in well servicing in recip, but as I mentioned earlier we expect that to resolve itself in the last six months of the year after the takeaway issues in the Permian get resolved. We've got positive momentum in power generation. The U.S. economy continues to be strong and that has an impact on both industrial and on our construction business. ","In transportation we expect our rail business to be better in 2019 than in 2018. As you know there's a lot of pipeline construction going on in North America, that's a positive for us. So again, we just go through industry by industry, country by country, and develop a forecast and we believe it will be up in 2019 modestly.","David Raso","But to the cadence question, I think what people are trying to figure out, are we starting the year with any growth rate cushion to be able to absorb second half of \u201819 if it is flat to down. We are just trying to get a sense of starting the year versus what\u2019s sort of baked into the back half. I mean we all can speculate, but I'll be honest, I was hoping to have a little more cushion to start the year from the backlog growth and what you just reported. The thing is we're just trying to get a sense of the cadence and what kind of just around the orders are needed later in the year. ","Andrew Bonfield","David, just to point out a couple of things. I mean the increase in the backlog is \u2013 the backlog at the end of the year was $16.5 billion versus $15.8 billion this year. That is despite putting more inventory into the channel. Just don\u2019t forget, these are dealer backlog orders effectively, so dealers have built inventory and they still expect \u2013 even though they built it, they are still asking us for $1 billion more on orders than we were at this time last year. So that does give us that confidence. ","I think as Jim said, you know we also have a look around end markets. We take all of these things into account you know and that doesn\u2019t give us the confidence to be able to say, we expect sales to be up modestly next year.","A - Jim Umpleby","And we do \u2013 certainly as you know, we have lumpiness in our oil and gas business and in our rail business and in our mining business frankly, so there are variations quarter-to-quarter as we ship lot and financially recognize large orders.","David Raso","No, I appreciate that. Okay, thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Gilardi. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question. ","Ross Gilardi","Hey, good morning everybody; Ross Gilardi, Bank of America.","A - Jim Umpleby","Good morning Ross.","Ross Gilardi","Could you help us a little bit on the quarterly earnings cadence for 2019 that you are expecting. I mean you did 255 in the fourth quarter, beat at 282 in the \u2013 you know the first quarter of \u201918. I mean our earnings up in the first quarter of \u201819 and if they are, can you help bridge with what you did in Q4 with what you would do in Q1. ","A - Andrew Bonfield","Yes Ross, its Andrew. Again, the 255 was impacted by the write downs in Cat Power Finance which we don't expect, and the mark-to-market losses in Cat Financial which we don't expect to recur. If you added that back, that would be about $2.70. We don't give quarterly guidance on earnings, but if that gives you, then you've got on top of that price increases and the start of the selling season which will impact Q1.","Jim Umpleby","I\u2019ll also add in there is that you recall that we had a very strong Q1 in 2018, so from a comp perspective that will be there as well. ","Ross Gilardi","Okay, got it. And then can you help us all on you know more on the mining OE side of the business and you know what you are expecting from a mining truck perspective and assuming in your 2019 outlook. Obviously that number is still way, way below what I think you guys would consider normalized demand. But are we at a pause here or does that number continue to grow nicely this year? ","Jim Umpleby","So certainly machine utilization by our mining customers continue to increase. We anticipate that our CapEx budgets will increase in 2019. The quotation activity remains robust and we expect our mining business to be higher in 2019 than \u201818, so that is a positive for us. ","Ross Gilardi","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. I just \u2013 you know given the macro concerns out there, one, can you comment on you know specifically what is any \u2013 are you taking any actions, you know whether it's production or you know additional cost actions you know given that concerns about the macro environment. I'm just trying to understand whether you guys are being proactive here or not, so first, if you could comment on that. ","And then my second question is, I know you said dealer inventory is expected to be sort of flat year-over-year. Are you doing anything as well with the dealers to make sure you know we are not over ordering or you know to again prepare for a market that could potentially be weaker. Thank you. ","Jim Umpleby","Yeah Jamie, certainly we've kept a very close control of costs and we saw that very cost in the fourth quarter of \u201818 were actually less than they were in the fourth quarter of 2017. I do remind you though that we are guiding to a sales \u2013 a modest sales increase in 2019, so we are not guiding to a sales decrease. Having said that we will continue to closely monitor costs and we\u2019ll always be ready for whatever the market send us. ","You know one of the things that we believe are in much better shape. At some point there will be a market downturn. We are not calling that \u201919, but whenever that does occur we are certainly in a much better position to generate cash than we were in the last downturn. So again, we\u2019ll be very cost disciplined here moving forward. ","Jamie Cook","And then sorry, just another one more follow-up. Just understanding restructuring is now part of GAAP, can you just help us understand what that number is and then also just the finance of contribution \u201819 versus \u201818 just given some of the one-offs that we had in \u201918? Thank. ","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah, so we would \u2013 obviously we are all going to a period where restructuring becomes much more normal. This year the charge was around $400 million. You should expect it to be substantially lower than that, otherwise we would still be adjusting it out of adjusted profit. ","I'm not going to give you a number, because obviously it depends on what activities we do and it will be reported in the Q and it depends on what actions we take in the business during the year, but it will be part of normal operating earnings and that\u2019s taking into account in that guidance. ","The other part of the question\u2026","Jamie Cook","The finance...","Jim Umpleby","Yeah, so this year I think write-offs relating to the Cat Power Finance portfolio in Latin America have amounted to somewhere around about $150 million in total. That would be the area in which we wouldn't expect to recover. ","Jamie Cook","Okay, I appreciate the color, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joe O\u2019Dea. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question. ","Joe O\u2019Dea","Hi, good morning. It's Vertical Research. I wanted to understand some of the cost headwinds in the quarter are a little bit better, so the degree to which you can expand on some of what happened on the materials and freight side that surprised you in the quarter, and then to understand how those work moving forward? Is that something that is corrected as of today and back to the kind of cost structure you expected to end 2018 with or those things that persist as of today and how long will that be the case? ","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah, yeah so I mean obviously things like manufacturing variances which were attributable to the absorption rates and so forth, obviously they end at the end of that period and they were a portion of that negative variance in the quarter and obviously that will be taken into account as we move into 2019 by some production, and we\u2019ll obviously continue to work those through. ","With regards to the material costs and freight costs, I mean we did see some material cost increases in the fourth quarter, which as we said we weren't expecting. Part of that is due to the fact that obviously we are an environment of constraint supply still and those did feed through into cost. Those will be built into numbers for 2019 and into our guidance range, so effectively we\u2019ll be a part of that manufacturing cost being offset by price realization as we move forward. So those are the two big things regarding that. ","Joe O\u2019Dea","And as of October you were talking I think about price offsetting cost and so is that meaning that you know a little bit more assertive on the price front to go after some of these costs or just trying to understand that dynamic of price cost neutrality and I think that was expected three months ago. You've got higher costs today, but you still expect to offset the unit price. ","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah, I think actually what we really expect to do is a little bit stronger performance in the fourth quarter than we actually expect price to more than offset costs. It didn't happen and so that was the \u2013 that was the challenge that actually happened there. As you look into 2019, as we said, we expect price to offset manufacturing cost increases. ","Joe O\u2019Dea","Got it. And then just on the revenue expectations for the year and the modest growth, as you walk through some of the key end markets and the puts and takes there, it's unclear I guess the degree to which you know you are looking at a scenario where you know volumes are up. So I think you know most of the commentary leans a little bit more constructive. ","There are some clear pockets of headwinds, but you know overall it leans a little bit more constructive and so is that to suggest that you know the base case expectation here is that we've got a little bit of volume growth in 2019 on top of the pricing expectations. ","Jim Umpleby","Yes, yes, there is there is a modest amount of volume increase on top of good price, that's correct. ","Joe O\u2019Dea","Great, thanks very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question. ","Ann Duignan ","Yes, hi, good morning; its JP Morgan. I'd like to go back to the financial services business and I was hoping you could give us some color on the unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment in Europe and Latin America specifically. Should we now be concerned that residual values are set too high and that this is just the beginning at negative residual value risk for the finco as we go forward, both in Europe and LATAM. ","Andrew Bonfield","Actually, most of that \u2013 Ann, this is Andrew again. Most of that is related actually to the Cat Power Financial portfolio rather than to construction equipment and that was specific items related to the portfolio I was talking about where we have had some troubled loans which we are making substantial progress on actually working through those. We've taken write offs in the second quarter and the fourth quarter and the residual risk is being managed and also the portfolio is been managed going forward. This is not a reflection of construction industry residuals. ","Jim Umpleby","If those write-offs were associated with, primarily with the marine portfolio for loans that were made quite some time ago. ","Ann Duignan ","Okay, and those are a surprise or have you been anticipating those as you run through the year? ","Jim Umpleby","I mean, as it always happens and until you actually take or repossess a piece of equipment back, you don't actually know what the real value is, so you have an estimate and some of those estimates were proving to be wrong. ","Ann Duignan ","Okay, and just real quick on my follow up on the revenue guidance, you know up modest but pricing should be 2.5% which again as others have pointed out, so just you know for the flat volumes. Can you talk about what you are seeing broadly in Europe? I know Turkey was a source of weakness, but are you seeing any broader weakness in Europe across the different regions? ","A - Jim Umpleby","Yes Ann, I don't believe we gave the 2.5% price guidance for \u201919, so I think that was\u2026","Ann Duignan ","A 1-4 aggregate is 2.5, right?","Jim Umpleby","That\u2019s fine, that\u2019s fine. So we talked about \u2013 just going around the world you asked about Europe, but again Turkey's been an area of real concern. Just going around the world, Brazil has been tough, Argentina has been tough, South Africa has been tough. But in terms of pointing to a particular country in Europe that has created concern for us, no. Obviously well are all waiting to see what happens with Brexit and how that'll shake out, but no, other than Turkey that's the biggest concern. ","Ann Duignan ","Okay, I\u2019ll leave it there, thank you. ","Jim Umpleby","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mig Dobre. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Mig Dobre","Yes sir, good morning, Baird. I want to go back to maybe understanding what's going on, on the cost side a little bit better. If you are saying that volumes here are going to grow modestly next year, how should we think about the manufacturing costs that are currently embedded in your outlook in terms of the headwinds on that and can you also may be comment at all on how you are thinking about R&D, how you are thinking about SG&A and I know somebody already asked a restructuring question. But what would you consider to be a normal restructuring level in terms of the transport for the business?","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah, so starting on \u2013 as well I think we\u2019ve tried to say, we expect price and manufacturing to offset each other, so that's our expectation. And obviously you know the timing of how those price increases come through and how that feeds through into the business route will be something that we'll be reporting on, but overall we expect the two to brush through the year. ","We will continue to make targeted investments in both R&D and in SG&A to expand their service offering and also other offerings as well, so those will \u2013 but we will be disciplined about those increases and they will affect around things which we expect to get a return on as you move forward. ","With regards to restructuring, the problem is if I give you a number today within restructuring, I can guarantee you that something will happen during the year which will change it, because as we know restructuring charges can only be taken once actually, and the announcements were made of some restructuring event. But what we expect them to be is substantially below the $400 million this year and therefore that's why we are prepared to observe what would have been normal earnings profit per share for the year. ","Mig Dobre","I see. Well, you know instead of asking a question maybe I'll just make a comment. I don't know about the other participants on the call, but as far as I'm concerned I can tell you I'm having a really hard time equating exactly all that\u2019s baked into guidance vis-\u00e0-vis, but we\u2019re all kind of learning it in terms of how commodity prices are progressing, fuel prices are progressing and really kind of your putting your overall outlook together for 2019. ","So I'm wondering, if there's a way at the Analyst Day or maybe next call that we can get a little more granularity at signal level in terms of what are you thinking from revenue and what you are thinking for margins as well. I think that would be really helpful. Thank. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question. ","Jerry Revich ","Hi, good morning; its Goldman Sachs. ","A - Jim Umpleby","Hey Jerry.","Jerry Revich ","Jim, I\u2019m wondering if you could expand on your earlier comments in terms of pretty good quotation activity and resource industries. Can you just give us a flavor for in terms of commodities that are driving increase today and when do you expect that to translate to seeing order and backlog growth and resource indices again. Yeah, are you hearing from your customers that we're going to need greater clarity on U.S. China trade relations for them to place the orders or any additional context along those points would be helpful please?","Jim Umpleby","You know what we\u2019ve seen is the idle truck fleet continue to decline throughout 2018. As I mentioned earlier, the utilization of machines continue to increase. We believe that most of the units have now been bought back online and of course we are in a situation for number of years where there was a very large fleet parked and that is no longer the case. ","Most analysts are forecasting an average of 5% to 6% growth in miner\u2019s capital spending in 2019 compared to 2018. Certainly mining companies are working to get the most out of their assets and they're you know they are being cautious as to when they place orders, but quotation activity as I mentioned is quite robust. We are selling more product and we expect to have a higher level of business in \u201919. ","Certainly there is some softness in areas like Indonesian coal, but again that's being offset by demand in other regions. ","Jerry Revich ","And just to put a finer point on that, are you at a point where you think where now that quotation activity after hitting a pause and translating to orders in the back half of \u201818 will see greater pace of new equipment orders in the first half \u201819 based on the timing of the tenders that you are looking at? ","Jim Umpleby","Again, mining in particular is quite lumpy and you can get orders. A single order for a very large number of pieces of equipment that has an impact on the backlog, so again I hesitate to try to quantify it in terms of a quarterly cadence, but again year-on- year 2019 we expect higher sales \u201919 than \u201818. ","Jerry Revich ","Okay, thank you. And Jim the other area that you mentioned that's positive in \u201819 is locomotives. Can you just frame for us based on the production plant and orders in hand how much of a production ramp are we thinking about \u201819 verses \u201818 compared to you the healthy run rate this business was at prior to Q4?","Jim Umpleby ","Yeah, you know we are not going to quantify it, but certainly again you know the rail traffic has in fact increased in 2018. I think we mentioned in a previous call the we had good growth in real services and with higher traffic and also we made a couple of acquisitions as we mentioned earlier this morning. So we expect continued growth in our service and parts businesses, we are seeing rebuilt again, we expect our business to increase in \u201919, would hesitate to try to compare it to where we were in previous period, but it is getting better. ","Jerry Revich ","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question. ","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning; its RBC. I wanted to just go back to China for a second. You did talk about expectations for the Chinese construction market, the industry being kind of flattish, but can you just talk about whether you're seeing anything unusual there from a competitive pricing perspective and whether that is something that kind of contributed to the lower than expected construction margins in the quarter? Thanks. ","Jim Umpleby","I think as Andrew mentioned, that really did not impact construction margins in the quarter, that's not one of the things that we cited. Certainly you know we have competitors all over the world, we have competitors in China, but you know we are very well positioned in China. We have invested significantly. ","We have more than 20 manufacturing facilities. We have roughly 13,000 employees. We have local leadership teams. We\u2019ve vertically integrated our supply chain in China, so we are very well positioned to compete and win in China. We're introducing new products. So we feel good about our competitive situation in China and again there's a variety of forecasts that are out there, but after two years of a robust growth in CI for us in China we expect to be about flat next year. ","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah, can I just add a little bit of color on the CAT sales in China actually relating to this, because we did see very strong sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, which then fell through into the first half of this year where obviously China as you would expect in the normal selling season pre this summer actually were very, very strong. ","Third quarter and fourth quarter have diminished slightly form those first half of the year as you would expect a return to much more normal pattern. So actually \u2013 it wasn\u2019t actually an overall view of China for the year that impacted the quarter. It actually was just a weakness relating to a very strong comparative in 2017. ","Seth Weber","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you and Andrew maybe just follow-up on the, I think you said share buyback, you are targeting about 750 in the first quarter, which would be down for you know $1.8 billion here in the fourth quarter and you're sitting on you know $8 billion of cash. Is there a reason why you are not being more aggressive, I guess versus the 750 outlook for the first quarter?","Andrew Bonfield","Yeah, a couple of things. One to think about, on which is obviously we\u2019ve always said we would be opportunistic and would depend on market conditions, and so forth as to when we are going to market and our other uses of cash. The reality is actually in the first quarter we have a lower cash flow partially because of our incentive compensation payments. So we do take that into account when we're considering the amount of year. ","As you'll know now, this will be the fourth quarter in a row which will have done $750 million. Our aim is to be in the market on a more consistent basis rather than be in and out. But we will take opportunities try to actually go back and buy more, but that would depend on our free cash flow and other investment priorities.","Amy Campbell ","And I think that's going to \u2013 thanks Seth. I think that's going to need to be our last question. Jim do you have any final comments. ","Jim Umpleby ","Well, thank you Amy. Again, 2018 was a terrific year for CAT. We achieved record profit per share and strong operating cash flow, returned significant capital to shareholders and continued to invest for long term growth. ","Again as I mentioned, we believe our enterprise strategy is working. Even though 2018 was a record year, we\u2019ve increased our profit per share outlook for 2019 and look forward to continuing to serve our customers. ","Thanks for joining today\u2019s call. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. ","Amy Campbell ","Thanks Jim. And Kate, I think that concludes our call. ","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation."],"4366":["Caterpillar, Inc.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Jennifer Driscoll. Ma'am, the floor is yours.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Catherine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar's Third Quarter Earnings Call at our new, earlier time of 7:30 a.m Central. Joining us today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman of the Board and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, CFO; and Kyle Epley, vice president of our global finance services division; and Rob Rengel, Investor Relations Manager.","Our call today expands on our earnings release which we issued earlier this morning. You'll find slides to accompany today's presentation, along with the release, in the investors section of caterpillar.com, under events & presentations.","The forward-looking statements we make today are subject to risks and uncertainties. We'll also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we discuss today. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in today's news release for details on factors that individually or combined could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecasts. Let me remind you that Caterpillar has copyrighted this call, and we prohibit use of any portion of it without our prior written approval.","We're not reporting adjusted profit per share today, but remember we will at the end of the fourth quarter. This will exclude any mark-to-market gain or loss for the remeasurement of pension and other post-employment benefit plans as well as any other material discrete items. As a reminder: Our U.S. GAAP-based guidance for profit per share continues to include the benefit of the $0.31 discrete tax item we recognized in the first quarter. In a moment, you'll hear from Andrew with a summary of this quarter's financial results, but first let me turn the call over to Jim for our third quarter highlights, which appear on Slide 3.","Thank you.","James Umpleby","Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning and welcome to Caterpillar's Third Quarter Earnings Call. First, I'll cover our third quarter results at a high level and give you my perspective on the key factors influencing our performance. I'll then provide some context for our decision to lower our 2019 guidance and will discuss our expectations for the external environment.","The primary factor impacting our third quarter results was lower volume driven by reductions in dealer inventory and lower-than-expected demand from end users. Sales and revenues declined 6% during the quarter mostly due to Construction Industries and Resource Industries. During the third quarter of 2018, dealers increased inventory by $800 million in anticipation of increasing end user demand. This compares to a decline of $400 million in dealer inventory during the third quarter of 2019, a quarter-to-quarter change of $1.2 billion. Although the retail sales data we released this morning reflected an increase of 6% for both machines and Energy & Transportation, we believe dealers reduced inventory due to uncertainty in the global economy resulting from trade tensions and other factors. We've also made progress reducing our lead times, which allows dealers to maintain less inventory. Shorter lead times allows Caterpillar and our dealers to more quickly adapt to changing market conditions. We are taking steps to reduce production to match dealer demand.","Our third quarter operating profit decreased 5%, driven primarily by lower volume. We maintained our operating profit margin percent despite lower volume and some continued pressure on manufacturing costs. We anticipate meeting the full year operating margin targets communicated during our Investor Day last May.","Turning to the full year on Slide 4. We lowered our guidance for 2019 this morning. We now expect profit per share for the full year to be between $10.90 and $11.40 versus our prior guidance of the low end of the range of $12.06 to $13.06. Both ranges include the benefit of the $0.31 discrete tax item in the first quarter. Our revised outlook is primarily the result of caution being displayed by our dealers and customers due to uncertainty in the global economic environment. You'll recall that, during our second quarter earnings call, we expected dealers to reduce inventories by about $900 million during the last 6 months of the year. We now anticipate that dealers will reduce their inventories by about $1.3 billion versus second quarter levels. This includes a decrease of approximately $900 million during the fourth quarter. As a result, our production and shipment to dealers for the balance of the year will be lower than we previously anticipated.","As I mentioned earlier, the retail sales figures we released this morning showed growth of 6% for machines and Energy & Transportation. However, based on input from dealers and customers, we now expect fourth quarter end user demand to be about flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Based on our revised expectations for dealer inventory and end user demand, we now expect sales and revenues to be modestly lower for the full year versus our prior expectation of modest sales and revenue growth in 2019. The global economic situation is very fluid due to a variety of factors. The decline in dealer inventory, along with our improved lead times, will position us to react quickly to positive or negative developments in the global economy during 2020. As I mentioned, we're taking actions to reduce production levels to reflect dealer order patterns and will be ready to increase production if order levels improve. We're also taking action in other areas to improve the competitiveness and flexibility of our cost structure, which Andrew will expand upon shortly.","During our Investor Day in May, we shared our intention to drive long-term shareholder value by returning substantially all of our Machinery, Energy & Transportation free cash flow to shareholders through a competitive dividend and a more consistent share repurchase plan. Our balance sheet remained strong. During the third quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $1.03 per share, representing a 20% increase over the previous quarter. As previously communicated, we expect to increase our dividend by the high single-digits percent during each of the next 4 years, continuing as the dividend aristocrat. Our most recent dividend increase reflects the company's confidence in our ability to achieve improved free cash flows through the cycle, as we discussed in May.","We also repurchased $1.2 billion of common stock in the third quarter. We continue to expect share repurchases during the second half of the year will be similar to the first half, which will reduce our total quarterly average diluted shares outstanding by about 9% since the first quarter of 2018.","Now let me comment further on our expectations for the external environment.","In Construction Industries, we continue to anticipate North America end user demand to be higher than 2018 because of strength in state and local infrastructure and nonresidential construction activity. At the same time, we expect dealers to reduce their inventories in North America from current levels. Turning to Asia Pacific: We expect stimulus to help the industry in China, although the industry has weakened outside of China and Japan. We expect dealers in China to build inventory due to an earlier Chinese New Year in 2020. This will partially offset the decline in North America. We anticipate that EAME construction activity will be lower than 2018, as we are seeing weakening demand in Europe, while Africa and the Middle East are likely to remain challenged. We anticipate Latin America will continue to grow but from a low level.","For Resource Industries, most commodity prices remain at investible levels, with the exception of thermal coal which remains weak. Quoting activity and end user demand for mining equipment remains positive, and large mining trucks have further room for growth. We continue to believe we are in the early stages of a multiyear recovery in mining. However, miners are cautious due to economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, we expect softer demand for nonresidential construction in quarry and aggregate equipment as dealers further reduce their inventory.","Turning to Energy & Transportation. We expect that oil and gas will continue to be volatile based on oil price fluctuations and reduced capital spending for well servicing. Takeaway capacity constraints in the Permian Basin have improved, but overall industry demand remains relatively depressed. For gas compression, reciprocating gas engine sales for gas gathering have slowed, but Solar Turbines' gas compression business in North America remained strong. Power generation continues to be an area of expected growth. We continue to anticipate that Solar Turbines and Progress Rail will both have a strong fourth quarter.","Please turn to Slide 5. We continue to execute our strategy for profitable growth, which has 3 pillars: services, operational excellence and expanded offerings.","At our Investor Day in May, we announced our goal to double Machinery, Energy & Transportation services sales between 2016 and 2026. This target is challenging yet achievable. By growing our services, we will help our customers improve asset utilization and availability while reducing their owning and operating costs. We're continuing to invest to drive services growth, including expanding our digital capabilities. We continue to connect assets and invest in our digital architecture to provide actionable insights to our customers. For example, our Cat Inspect app helps customers identify the maintenance needs of a machine and plan accordingly. We're seeing close to 100,000 inspections on the app per month.","In the area of operational excellence, we use lean principles at our large engine facility in Lafayette, Indiana to improve safety, enhance engine quality and achieve greater manufacturing efficiencies. Lean improvements drove a 40% reduction in assembly time for our large 3600 engines, allowing us to produce more engines from the same facility while improving safety and quality. Our drive for operational excellence is a never-ending journey. Lean is helping us respond more quickly to changes in industry demand.","And the final pillar of our strategy is expanded offerings, enabling us to grow our business by addressing the diverse needs of our customers around the world. We introduced a new Dynamic Gas Blending or DGB engine for our well-servicing customers. The new Tier 4 engine, which is unique in our industry, allows customers to replace up to 85% of diesel fuel with natural gas. Our DGB product helps our oil and gas customers to be more successful by improving operating economics by offering fuel flexibility.","We're continuing to offer -- we're continuing our focus on autonomy, semiautonomy and remote operation as we expand our offerings. We believe Caterpillar leads our industry in all 3 areas. Some of our early customers have cited productivity benefits of up to 30% using CAT autonomous mining solutions. In addition, our customers are seeing real improvements in safety, in some cases up to a 90% reduction in safety incidents. One of our competitive advantages is that we can retrofit our competitors' equipment, making our autonomous solutions an option for mixed fleets. We're encouraged by the recent wins we've had in autonomy this year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew for a closer look at our financials.","Andrew Bonfield","Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 6 with third quarter results, focusing in particular on what drove the top line. Then I'll turn to our revised outlook before finishing on capital deployment.","Sales and revenues for the third quarter declined by 6% to $12.8 billion. Operating profit decreased by 5% to $2 billion. Profit per share declined by 8% to $2.66. Overall, our results were lower than we'd expected. This quarter was largely a volume story. As you've seen on Slide 7, sales volume declined by $751 million. Construction Industries and Resource Industries drove this decline. The unfavorable currency movements were caused by the euro and the Australian dollar. It's important to understand the moving parts behind the volume figures. As Jim mentioned, the primary driver was changes dealers made in their inventories. If the impacts of this year-on-year change were to be excluded from our top line results, the underlying sales performance will be in line with the growth we reported in retail machine sales statistics this morning. We expect to see dealing inventory decline further in the fourth quarter, and I'll talk about that later when I discuss changes to our 2019 outlook.","Now let me discuss the individual segments. Firstly, on Slide 8. We saw strong margin performance from Energy & Transportation, which is not surprising as the second half tends to be stronger for that business. Despite a 2% sales decline, segment profit decreased by $48 million or 5% mainly due to lower incentive compensation expense. The segment margin finished at 18.7% of total sales, an expansion of 120 basis points.","In Resource Industries, shown on Slide 9, the impact of lower volumes and higher warranty expenses, which were partially offset by favorable price realization, drove the margin down by 220 basis points. Total sales decreased by 12%, and segment profit decreased by 25% to 13.5% of sales. The top line performance was driven by changes in dealer buying patterns. Dealers increased their inventories in the third quarter of 2018, whilst they decreased them in this quarter. Margins in Resource Industries are the most sensitive to fluctuations in volume. In the first and second quarters, margins were strong, driven by the leverage associated with volume growth. We'd expect the fourth quarter to show a similar pattern to the third quarter, but overall we expect full year margins for the segment to be higher than they were in 2018.","Now turning to Slide 10. For Construction Industries, sales declined by 7% due to reduced volumes. Our sales in the Asia Pacific region slowed versus a strong third quarter last year as dealers decreased inventories, particularly in China, versus an increase in the prior year. In North America we saw a solid third quarter in sales tied to road and nonresidential building construction. In the September rolling 3-month sales per user data published this morning, we showed an increase of 4% in worldwide dealer sales of construction equipment. We continue to develop and launch new products around the world, helping our customers move in their unique environments and enabling us to extend this growth over the long term. The segment margin fell by 80 basis points to 17.8%. While price continued to offset manufacturing costs, negative volume and mix were greater than the impact of lower short-term compensation expense.","Let's move to Slide 11 for a discussion of our profit performance. Altogether, third quarter operating profit decreased by 5%. The volume decline I spoke about earlier was the main driver of the change year-over-year. Our overall margin structure remains healthy. Although in absolute dollar terms both have moderated in the third quarter, price realization continues to offset increases in manufacturing costs. Obviously, pricing realization was lower as we lapped the midyear price increase in 2018, but equally we have seen the rate of growth in material and freight costs moderate as we've gone past the start of the significant changes in 2018.","Our profit margin was 15.8% of sales and revenues in the third quarter, flat versus the prior year. Let me talk you through some of the headwinds and tailwinds outside of the volume that impacted operating profit. Starting with tailwinds: Period costs have declined, helped in part by lower short-term incentive compensation expense. As for headwinds, as I mentioned a moment ago, we incurred higher warranty expense from products in Resource Industries versus a very low level in 2018. We continue to address some targeted product quality issues, as we're focused on ensuring our customers enjoy the performance and quality they expect from our products. We also experienced some negative operating leverage associated with slowing production due to the lower volumes, and we are still experiencing some inefficiencies associated with supplier constraints and product launches.","Turning to the outlook on Slide 12. Let me comment briefly on the full year outlook a bit before turning to our fourth quarter expectations. As Jim mentioned, we have lowered the annual guidance. Our new outlook is based on changes in our assumptions around end user demand and revised expectations for dealer inventory, reflecting caution on the part of our dealers and our end-user customers. Related to our lower dealer inventory expectations, this will mean that we have -- will have less of an overhang from dealer inventory as we move into 2020. However, the other implication of this change is that we need to manage production and reduce our shipments to dealers through the balance of the year. Jim also mentioned that end user demand is expected to dampen. We believe this reflects end customers delaying purchases of capital equipment in light of the uncertainty they're seeing in the business environment.","Our assumption of modestly lower sales and revenues for the full year 2019 flows from these changes to our expectations. Both of these factors are also flowing to the order backlog, which was $14.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, about $400 million lower than the second quarter. Order backlog decreased mostly in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. We believe this decline reflects a combination of our improved availability, dealer expectations for lower demand from end markets in the fourth quarter and dealers who decide to reduce inventory levels. However, it is difficult to disaggregate this decline into each of these components. Therefore, we will continue to closely monitor end user demand, commercial shipments, dealer inventory, orders and backlog; and adjust our production levels accordingly. As many of you know, our dealers are independent entities and control their own inventories. Our goal remains to strike a balance between satisfying dealer demand and avoiding excess inventory in the system.","We're also taking actions in other areas of our cost structure, particularly around things like general and administrative cost actions. While we've begun projects in a couple of these areas, we don't expect to recognize the benefits in the short term. We're committed to maintaining a competitive and flexible cost structure, and we are controlling discretionary spend. As we said on Investor Day, we are committed to improving margins by between 3 to 6 percentage points compared to historical performance.","Now let me share a few of our assumptions on the fourth quarter performance. Based on those changes in dealer behavior I mentioned, we now expect about a $900 million reduction in dealer inventories in the fourth quarter versus a $200 million inventory build in Q4 last year. We also now assume flattish end user demand in the fourth quarter year-on-year. Previously, we had assumed end user demand would increase at a similar rate that we have seen throughout the year or about 4%. As we no longer expect to see dealer inventories -- inventory reduce by higher sales to end-users, this means that almost all of the inventory reduction has to come from lower shipments from Caterpillar to our dealers given that we now anticipate about a mid-single-digit decline in sales in the fourth quarter.","So the assumptions for lower dealer inventory levels and lower end user demand feed into lowered guidance, so we'll need to cut production further in the fourth quarter. We do expect to see some negative operating leverage as a result of lower production. However, we expect this to be partially offset by favorability in material costs as we lap the 2018 increases in freight and material costs. In addition, we expect slightly higher warranty costs, given the increase in warranty expense year-to-date, against a very low comparative in 2019.","Obviously, it's very disappointing to reduce our guidance for the year. Our July guidance took into account the fact we have -- we expected dealer inventory to reduce in the balance of the year. However, the greater-than-expected reduction in dealer orders in the third quarter and the shift down in anticipated end user demand understandably dampens our expectations.","That brings me to our capital structure on Slide 13. We are committed to returning substantially all of our Machinery, Energy & Transportation free cash flow to shareholders through a competitive dividend along with more consistent share repurchases. We believe that's the best way to create long-term shareholder value. Excluding the discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plans, which I'll discuss in a moment, our free cash flow remained strong. That means we've been able to fund a competitive and growing dividend, and indeed we paid about $600 million of dividends this quarter. Our recent 20% dividend increase reflects the company's confidence in our ability to maintain strong cash flows across the cycles. And to remind you: We've said we intend to increase the dividend by at least high single-digit percentage in each of the 4 years.","We repurchased $1.2 billion of our common stock in the third quarter. Our quarterly share repurchases -- repurchase plans consider our projected cash flows and takes into account the intrinsic value of our shares. We will continue to be flexible, and in periods of time our cash flow is more variable as a result of dynamics in the external environment, we'll be able to use our balance sheet to maintain flexibility and returning substantially all of our free cash flow to shareholders over time. We continue to project share purchases for the second half to be similar to the first half, and we continue to expect to reduce our total quarterly average diluted shares outstanding by about 9% from the first quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, we continue to invest in services, operational improvements and expanded offerings. And we ended the quarter with $7.9 billion of cash on hand.","You may have seen our announcement last month that we had issued $1.5 billion of 10-year and 30-year notes in the third quarter, enabling a $1.5 billion voluntary contribution to the U.S. pension plans. This action increases the plans' funded status, allowing Caterpillar to further execute our strategy of reducing volatility in our pension liability. A secondary benefit of the contribution is we -- that we now don't expect to make any further contributions to the U.S. pension plans for a substantial period of time, therefore freeing up cash for discretionary deployment. This contribution has no impact on our credit rating metrics. Finally, it was funded at attractive interest rates; and was actually part of our cost-saving initiatives, as it lowers our long-term pension insurance-related costs.","So finally, let's turn to Slide 14 and recap today's key points. Third quarter's sales and revenue declined by 6%, and profit per share by 8%, due to volume declines driven by changes in dealer buying patterns. We reduced our 2019 profit per share outlook range to a range of $10.90 to $11.40 based on expectations that dealers would further reduce their inventory levels and that end market demand would flatten in the fourth quarter. We're proactively managing production to address expected changes in demand. We're working on the competitiveness of our cost structure, and a relentless execution of the operating and execution model remains at the center of everything we do.","Our overall financial position remains strong, and we remain very much committed to our strategy of profitable growth and deployment of capital back to shareholders through a growing dividend and consistent share repurchases.","With that, I'll hand it over to the operator for the start of the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","I guess, a couple questions. First, on the resource side, I think that sales and margin surprised people a little, while the overall quarter was fairly good. You talked about warranty. You talked about production cuts. Is there any way you can sort of quantify what the impact of that was in the quarter on the margin front? And is there anything that you're seeing sort of from the order intake side to suggest that there is more downside risk on the sales side for 2020 and what that implies for margins? And then my second question, bigger picture sort of on 2020. I guess the assumption is you go into 2020 with producing in line with retail demand. Is there any way you can help us with other puts and takes? It sounds like there is a cost-cutting program that could be additive, sort of incentive comp, share count lower. I'm just trying to think about the puts and takes that we should consider positive or negative. We can make our own assumption on volumes.","James Umpleby","Well, Jamie, just a couple of comments. I think it's important to remember for Resource Industries that it's a mix of mining products and heavy construction in quarry and aggregates. So you've seen weaker sales unexpected on the heavy construction and aggregate side of the business. Mining sales on a year-to-date basis continue to be positive, and rebuilds and part sales remained strong across the board. In the third quarter, we did see dealers reduce inventory related to heavy construction and some isolated pockets in mining for coal-related inventory. Again, I just want to emphasize that, again, RI does include both that heavy construction and mining, so it's not just a mining story.","Andrew Bonfield","And moving on to the margins, Jamie. It really is all around volume and mix. So the biggest driver both on a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis all relates to that. All the other items are puts and takes virtually as we move through. Remember, versus last year, we have lower short-term incentive compensation, but that is offset partly by a higher warranty, but versus quarter-on-quarter, all the other items are -- really washes all down to volume. And then moving into 2020, I mean, obviously at this stage, as we've said, the situation global economic outlook is very uncertain, so we are not going to be providing sort of sales guidance or top line or outlook guidance at this stage. We're still in the middle of our budgeting process, and things are very fluid. However, on some of the things, yes, we are continuing to look at our cost structure. As I've mentioned, we are looking at things like G&A and back-office costs, procurement costs and so forth. All of those are initiatives that are ongoing and will continue to go. They are part of maintaining a flexible and competitive cost structure. And then as far as share count, as we've said, by the end of this year, we'll have reduced the share count by about 9%. That will have an impact of about -- obviously they're split between 2018 and 2019, so there will be a bit of a tailwind from that. Next year, there will be a little bit negative on short-term incentive compensation. We expect this year to be about $150 million lower than our base plan. That obviously will be reset for next year.","Jamie Cook","Okay, but I mean in -- the goal for 2020 to produce in line with retail demand, so sort of in a flat market it's not unreasonable to assume you could probably grow earnings.","Andrew Bonfield","Obviously it depends what your assumptions are on top line, yes. So if your assumption is we have a flat retail market, that obviously would flow through, yes.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.","Robert Wertheimer","Thanks for the commentary on dealer inventory and otherwise. It seems like you made a positive step. And dealer inventories are going down, up last quarter, going down now; and yet that was only maybe a -- I don't know, maybe 1\/4 of the total cut to revenues. So I'm trying to square the circle here. The dealer sales in retail seemed pretty good in your release this morning, up mid-single digit. You're reducing dealer inventory and those sales are up. And so I guess dealers must have really gotten more conservative on orders, but could you just talk about dealer inventory cut being 1\/4 of that overall revenue cut? And then did you see any cancellations in Solar or any direct sales or larger projects?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So Rob, if you think about -- I think you're talking about over the full year rather than actually in the quarter because obviously, in the quarter, we saw a quite significant year-on-year impact of dealer inventory because it was up $0.8 billion last year and down $0.4 billion. So when we started the year, if you remember, our assumption was that actually we would have flat dealer inventories and a modest growth in sales. And obviously now what we're saying is with a $500 million build of sales we are seeing slightly lower sales for the full year. Yes, we are -- our view is that probably we've lost about 2% on retail versus where our base case guidance started the year. So effectively that's been the big driver. That mostly relates to expectations out there and particularly obviously in the fourth quarter where it's dampened quiet -- dampened down to flat. We've been running a sort of 4% to 6% for the full year. Our full year expectation was probably at the top end of that range, and we're not going to meet that.","James Umpleby","You asked a question about larger order for Solar. No, Solar's business continues to remain strong.","Operator","Your next question is coming from David Raso from Evercore ISI.","David Raso","I think people are just trying to figure out the -- regardless where The Street is for 2020, you've now kind of put out a $2.40 midpoint adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter. And just trying to get a sense; sort of annualize that, say $9.60. The margins for the fourth quarter seem to be implied around 13% to 13.5%. Just trying to get a feel from you. And I know 2020 is a lot of planning is still going on, but the approach you took to the fourth quarter, to get a sense of that $9.60 run rate -- or do we feel like we're trying to bottom the earnings a bit here if the retail can just be flattish, even down a bit next year? How do you view your margins in the fourth quarter? That 13% to 13.5% implied, is that -- I mean, how much of a hit? Because obviously $900 million in inventory reductions is a bit of a drag that maybe you want to see again in 2020, that big a drag in 1 quarter. Can you just take us through your thought process on how you view the fourth quarter and those margins?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes, Dave. So the fourth quarter, as you always -- as you know, is always our lowest quarter from a margin perspective. As we think through the year and our production cycles and the way obviously through accounting and the way we benefit from operating leverage by volume, effectively you tend to see Q1 and Q2 stronger margins, Q3 slightly lower. And particularly in CI you normally see a historic -- at least a 1.5 percentage points drop in margin in Q4. So that is why normally Q4 margins are lower than for the balance of the year. As we look for this year, obviously the dealer inventory would normally be a further reduction in margin because you're having an element of deleverage. However, there are some things running the other way, particularly things like lower STIP, short-term incentive compensation. We also have lapped a lot of the material and freight cost increases from last year, so that does help from an overall margin perspective. And then we are seeing, obviously, last year, we did have some negative in Cat Financial in particular as well. And then obviously, as you get to PPS, you're also going to see the benefit of lower share count. So all of those factors are weighing in as we think about the fourth quarter. I would not read through fourth quarter margins as being our likely margin structure as we move into 2020. We would expect normal seasonable patterns to happen in 2020. Obviously it then just depends on what the volume is and how that volume throughput flows through into variable margins.","David Raso","Well, that was sort of the spirit of the question. I mean the fourth quarter is usually low, as someone is taking a little bigger hit, as we said, of the inventory reduction. Because the math I'm running, even if sales are down 5% next year, even if the margins stay that low, you're still run-rating $9.60, all right? That's assuming share repo and everything else. So just trying to get a sense of we could all make our view of retail demand, but it just seems like, if that's the fourth quarter with that margin -- and you just answered my question. You don't think the margins should go lower than that. It is sort of trying to at least baseline this run rate earnings power. I mean a lot could change, but I appreciate the answer. I just wanted to get a sense of how you view that fourth quarter margin, so okay.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Tiss","I just wondered around pricing. Is sort of the bulk of the pricing -- or any color you can give us on is that coming from new products and features? Or is that just coming more from raw material pass-throughs? And any sort of setup into 2020, how you're looking at pricing potential for 2020?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So obviously, as I've mentioned, we did see the rate of price moderate in Q3. That was as effectively we've lapped the price increase that happened in the midyear as well, and obviously we are now working through the end -- the \"beginning of the year\" price increase. We have -- given that it gave us an indication of price increases in 2020, we expect price to be much more moderate in 2020. Obviously, it's depending -- or that will also then depend on the competitive environment as well as we move into 2020, and we'll provide a little bit more feel of that when we get to our guidance in January.","Joel Tiss","And no color around the is it more from new features and new products. Or is it just raw material related?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. I mean we tend -- that price that we recognize on the way we give you is -- tends to be around real price increases rather than actually mix increases. So obviously mix will go, which -- with new product would tend to go into the mix bucket when we look at mix and volume rather than price.","Joel Tiss","Okay. And then just quick, for Jim. Any pieces of the portfolio that you feel like over the next five years need to be beefed up; or things, as you're getting deeper into your operational excellence, that maybe wouldn't fit? And you don't have to name the pieces but just kind of just more of a structural question of changing the portfolio versus just returning cash.","James Umpleby","Yes. We continually evaluate our portfolio. We're always thinking about resource allocation. That's, of course, part of the O&E Model. We've talked a lot about our intent to continue to invest in services to grow the aftermarket because that represents the best opportunity for future profitable growth for both us and our dealers, but in terms of changing the portfolio, we're always evaluating what potential changes we could make to drive more shareholder value.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley.","Courtney Yakavonis","Just wanted to go back to the dealer inventory destock expected in the fourth quarter. It seems like most of it was coming from resources and then also from APAC construction this quarter. Can you just comment on how much of that will be coming additionally from those regions versus North America construction and whether you're also expecting a decent amount there? And then just back on resources, where you called out the softer demand in nonresi construction and quarry and aggregate versus thermal coal prices, can you just help us understand how big of a factor each of those was; and just again as we're thinking about the fourth quarter and into 2020, how big of a drag this can still be; or whether you're expecting a replacement cycle to offset that?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So let me start on the dealer inventory, Courtney. The -- first, fourth quarter expectations are that most of the dealer inventory reduction will come in North America, which will impact North American revenue -- sales and revenues in Q4. We actually do expect an inventory build again in -- particularly in China, in Q4, and that's partly in recognition of the fact that there's an early Chinese New Year. And obviously that means the selling season starts earlier in China next year. So that will be a factor as we move into Q4. With regards to your question on ROI, I think the -- our view is overall mining probably will be -- remain positive for the year. If you look at mining CapEx and expectations of mining CapEx, that remains positive, so our expectation is that will effectively reflect through. If we look at things like power fleet, it's at the lowest level since we've ever been recording it which is since 2013. So there is latent demand there. And as we said, we do think obviously miners are being cautious on their capital investments, but there is the demand and replacement cycle that is needed at some stage, particularly on large mining trucks. I will just remind you that is only a portion of our RI business. I know it's often what people tend to use as the sort of marker but relatively small. I think obviously, as far as nonresi construction is concerned, our expectation probably is relatively that will be a drag, particularly in Q4, as effectively -- particularly that is the area where there's still more inventory to come out.","James Umpleby","If I can just add a couple comments, Courtney, on mining. So again, we believe we're in the early stages of our multiyear recovery in mining. Just given the economic turmoil going on, our mining customers are being cautious, and so they are hesitant to pull the trigger on new equipment, although again we're seeing increased sales. So we're seeing improvement in that business. One thing is -- to also keep in mind is that, when miners sometimes delay, that creates opportunities for us for rebuilds and parts. So that isn't all negative either. So again, it's an opportunity either way.","Courtney Yakavonis","Would you characterize aftermarket as still being stronger than you would have expected otherwise?","James Umpleby","I say that it continues to be strong. It's how I would characterize it. It continues to be strong, about as we expected.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross Gilardi","I just want to ask on the dividend, in committing to a high single-digit increase over the next four years. I mean, if you apply a 7% to 9% increase, your dividend is $5.40 to $5.80 in four years. I would assume you plan on covering the dividend with earnings internally even at the trough of the cycle. And if that's the case, it would seem like you're implying at least $6 of trough earnings, so I just wanted -- I was hoping you could just comment on the thought process. And in your mind, is there some type of minimum earnings payout ratio that you're assuming at the trough of the cycle in making that commitment to raise the dividend at that level given obviously you have no visibility on what's going to happen in the next 3 or 4 years?","Andrew Bonfield","Ross, so if you remember, when we -- at Investor Day, we actually talked about it in terms of cash coverage rather than actually in earnings coverage. And actually in cash coverage, even when our expectations are of the low cycle, is that we would expect to actually pay out no more than 50% to 60% of free cash flow in dividends even in the low end of the cash flow cycle. Obviously cash is slightly different. If you plot cash against earnings per share, there are obviously differences in the way because obviously, if you are in a downward cycle from a revenues perspective, obviously sometimes that actually is positive from a cash flow perspective if you are reducing working capital through that period of time. So there are puts and takes as to why you can't correlate it exactly to EPS, but it does reflect our confidence. So obviously we do have -- expect both cash flows and operating margins to be positive and to reflect our Investor Day targets through all parts of the cycle as we move forward.","Ross Gilardi","So in saying that, Andrew, just to do the math for everybody, I mean, it sounds like in your view you think you're going to do at least $10 of free cash flow at the bottom of the cycle.","Andrew Bonfield","Obviously we said 4 billion to 6 -- I think it's $4 billion to $6 billion was our range that we talked about, on Investor Day, of cash flow. So obviously, yes, you can work that back through in the math.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. And then just on China excavator market share: I mean there was a lot of focus on this 6 to 9 months ago. If you look at the data, your share seems to have stabilized in recent months. Is that correct? And how has that been the case? Have you had to match the competition with lower pricing? Or is it more new product- and innovation-driven?","James Umpleby","So this is Jim. So market share in any area of the world tends to be -- is always fluid and dynamic. We've talked previously about the fact that we are introducing new products in China, our GC product line. Our dealers continue to build up their capability with better coverage, so it's a whole variety of issues. And again it's a very dynamic situation, but we're confident in our ability to compete in China long term. And we demonstrate the ability to do that, but there will be fluctuations on a short-term basis up or down. That's just part of the deal.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye","Jim, you mentioned progress this quarter with respect to shortening product lead times. Can you provide some more color around that? I guess, particularly, what's been accomplished internally versus a function of easing pressure from some of these inventory reductions? What have you actually accomplished in terms of making the supply chain and production more nimble?","James Umpleby","Yes. It's a combination of a variety of factors. We had discussed in previous calls that with the sharp increase in volume in 2017 and 2018 many of our suppliers struggled to allow us to help the retailers we provide to given that period of rapidly increasing demand. So there's been improvement in the supply base because, as I mentioned in my initial remarks, we've also been very focused on becoming more efficient within our factories, reducing lead times, applying lean. So really it's a combination of all those factors.","Noah Kaye","And then on mining, maybe a question about how your customers are viewing autonomy relative to other CapEx priorities. You mentioned the retrofit offering. You've announced several greenfield projects. We did see a case recently, I believe, where one of your large mining customers was considering going autonomous but then decided to overhaul its existing fleet and focus on productivity. So I guess the question is, is that the trend or the exception? Is CapEx discipline generally holding back around a reduction of autonomous haulage? Or does this 30% productivity improvement from autonomy provide enough of a step change in fleet profitability that it would actually drive companies to replace or retrofit fleets earlier than typical?","James Umpleby","We've seen a lot of interest and activity in autonomy. I think, if you look at that 30% productivity increase, it really can be a game changer for many of our customers. Obviously every customer is in a very different situation. They could be a coal customer. They could be as in a variety of commodities. So customers make decisions based on their particular financial situation, but we're very, very pleased at the adoption rates that we're seeing in autonomy in the last year or so. You mentioned the greenfield projects. Again, we do believe it's a game changer, and we're very bullish about the outlook for that product capability.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Ann Duignan for JPMorgan Securities.","Ann Duignan","Yes. Maybe you could address the comments you made earlier about Asia Pacific sales. I think you said sales outside of China were weaker than expected. If you could expand on that. And then what specifically are you seeing in China in terms of end market demand and the fundamentals? Any green shoots in that region?","James Umpleby","Ann, starting then with your last question first. So on China, the industry, as you know, for us is mostly hydraulic excavators 10 tonnes above. And the industry continues to be strong. So given the fact that that's the majority of our market in China, we have not seen a decline there. So that's a positive. As I did mention earlier, outside of China and Japan we have seen some weakness in construction over the last few months.","Ann Duignan","Where specifically?","James Umpleby","Country-wise, I think it's pretty well dispersed over the Asia region outside of those 2 countries.","Andrew Bonfield","And Ann, just remember most of our revenues in those markets are basically China and Japan. So that is the bulk. I mean these other markets tend to be relatively small compared to China and Japan.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And my follow-up is you've got 130 days of inventories on hand as of the end of Q3. Where would you expect inventories to end at year-end? And is your assumption at this point that end market demand is flat going into next year? I mean, what are the downside risks that we'll go into next year having to underproduce retails? Are you comfortable that you'll have rightsized your own inventories by year-end?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So Ann, as we look out -- I mean, are you talking about CAT inventories or dealer inventories? I think you're taking about CAT [indiscernible] -- yes, yes.","Ann Duignan","CAT inventories based on then there's 130 days versus 119 a year ago.","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So the rise in that -- obviously there is a lag between, actually as we slow production down, ordering components and so forth before it actually flows all through in today's sales. So obviously you're also reflecting based on days sales, which are also impacted by things like dealer inventory as well. So that has some impacts unless you've -- you take them into account, but the bigger -- we are looking obviously inventory. We do normally expect a normal seasonal pattern, which is actually inventories to reduce in Q4, but obviously as we talk at the moment, obviously we're looking at actually reducing material purchases to reflect the production declines we've spoken about. But that should rightsize itself. As we move into 2020, we would expect to be in a pretty normal position.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Stanley Elliott from Stifel.","Stanley Elliott","Quick question. Is there a way to quantify where you will finish 2019 in terms of the service sales versus the 2016 -- 2026 targets? And then also, you've done a nice job of developing a lot of this in house. Is this something the path will continue forward, or is there something that you'll need to look outside the organization with M&A?","James Umpleby","Yes, Stanley, what we intend to do is, when we announce our fourth quarter results, we will release our ME&T service sales so you'll get a sense of how we're doing. And as we talked about at Investor Day, it won't be a straight line up, all right? It can be impacted by a whole variety of factors in terms of rebuilds and what's going on. And we're making investments in digital and other things. To answer your question: We utilize outside parties. We are certainly beefing up our internal capabilities as well and particularly in the area of digital, but we're open to M&A. So we've start to think about resource allocation and think about how we intend to grow those areas that are most profitable. Certainly we're open to that as well and one of those things we continue to evaluate.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Timothy Thein from Citi.","Timothy Thein","So the question is on orders and relative to the guidance that you've provided in terms of what you think end user demand and dealer inventories do in the fourth quarter. I'm curious how you think orders play into this. And presumably you have maybe a bit less year-end budget flush than prior years, but just curious to get your thoughts as to how that plays out. And help us in terms of think about a range in terms of where year-end backlog may end.","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. So as we look out, obviously if you look where we are on backlog at the moment, it's impacted by a number of factors. One of them, obviously primary, is dealer's expectations of inventory reductions. It depends on where we end. Obviously the big unknown factor is what is dealer's expectations of future growth going to be at the end of the year because that will impact their order pattern in Q4. So it really is a function of that. As it stands at the moment, you would -- obviously the backlog decline in Q3 reflects a lot of the dealer desire to reduce their inventories, which will -- obviously the $0.9 billion. It depends whether they decide whether they would like to reduce inventories further in 2020, and then at this point in time, we just don't knows about that. That's too early for us to tell.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","All right, yes. Jim, I'm wondering if you can talk about what you folks are seeing in terms of the forward-looking parts demand indicators for your resource business as we've seen the useful life assumptions get pushed out by the miners. Presumably you have pretty good visibility on major rebuilds coming up. Is 2020 a major inflection? And then you've spoke about the moving pieces in the market given the economic uncertainty. Can you just talk about when -- based on the project and work that you anticipate, when do you expect resources will go back to growing the backlog as we, hopefully, see an acceleration towards more replacement-type levels of demand?","James Umpleby","Yes. Thank you. So for Resource Industries, our rebuild activity and parts activity has been strong and we expect that to continue to be strong, so we're not looking forward to a -- significantly an increase or a decrease. It's been strong and we think that will continue.","Andrew Bonfield","Yes. And as far as actually when do we expect the -- [indiscernible] point about what is the timing of any bounce, the -- on sort of particularly around power fleet and replacement, I think it's really, really difficult for us to see when that will happen, Jerry, to put a particular time line to it. I think obviously, based on all the stats that we're looking at, we do expect it to happen. It's just a matter of time of that, and that really depends on miners' views of their outlook. And obviously, as we said, everything apart from coal is investible, so it's not the investment decision. It's probably their view of the outlook in particular.","James Umpleby","Well, just given the history of the last 10 years, I believe that miners will continue to be cautious here. So again I think it'll be a multiyear increase, so it'll gradually get better, as opposed -- we probably won't see the volatility that we've seen in the past, either up or down, which frankly will be a positive thing for us and the industry, to have it be more steady, more of a steady increase over several years than -- again, than volatility we've seen previously.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And Andrew, on the free cash flow number at the trough that you spoke about at the Analyst Day, what level of working capital contribution are you folks embedding? I think, in prior cycles, it's generally been $1.5 billion to $2 billion of positive free cash flow, as inventories have come down. Is that what you're contemplating relative to that trough number?","Andrew Bonfield","Yes, yes. So actually the -- to correct the number: I said $4 billion to $6 billion. It's actually $4 billion to $8 billion. So I actually underestimated the top end, but actually what we do -- I mean we use similar working capital assumptions, as we've seen in previous cycles, so it actually isn't working capital which was the main benefit to cash flow. It's the lack of restructuring costs. It's lower CapEx and also the fact that obviously the structural costs will be taken out. So the improved margins. Those are the three biggest drivers of improved cash flow.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Mig Dobre from Robert W. Baird.","Mircea Dobre","Just looking to clarify some earlier comments on the dealer inventory destock. So you're exiting the year with an additional $500 million of inventory at dealer level year-over-year. So if we're assuming that retail sales are flat in 2020, would that allow you to produce the retail demand? Or is there additional destocking that would be needed?","Andrew Bonfield","So Mig, I need just remind you again it's dealers who make those decisions about their inventory levels. It's not us. Availability and all those things can play a part. Ultimately, at the end of the day, given the lead time for production and the fact that dealers don't want to miss revenues, they'll make decisions based on that and what their expectations are of the future. Obviously, when we look at it, we believe that the level of dealer inventory is within the range of probability that we would expect, the comfort level that we've talked about, 3 to 4 months. And it stays in that range. Obviously there can be movements within that range which aren't necessarily we're going to have control. They are dealer decisions.","James Umpleby","And again just given the external environment, the uncertainty in the dynamic environment we're in, we believe we're well positioned regardless of what happens positive or negative in 2020. We have -- we shortened our lead times. We have an appropriate level of -- our dealers have set up an appropriate level of inventory, so we think we're prepared either way.","Mircea Dobre","Okay. Understood. And then my follow-up is really on the levers that you have to manage your costs as we're seeing some volume fluctuation here. I mean, if I'm looking at incentive comp, it came down modestly from last quarter. As we look going forward, how do you think about any restructuring or any other actions that you might have to undertake if indeed volumes remain weak? Or do you feel like at this point you've got enough flexibility within your cost structure to be able to handle that without any meaningful moves?","James Umpleby","So we continually evaluate our cost structure. There's a number of things that we're working on. Andrew mentioned some things that we're doing looking at our back-office costs, if you will. So we're -- we have some things, projects that we started there. We're looking at material costs. That's certainly a big lever for us; and that's one of the things that we're working on, both direct and indirect costs. We continue to look at ways to become more efficient. So again, we're continually doing that. We won't make a call as to whether or not we'll have major restructuring or not. Again, we'll see what the market brings to us over the next few months. Either way, we're ready. We'll be ready to respond.","Jennifer Driscoll","Okay. And that's our last question. Jim?","James Umpleby","Well, thank you for your questions. We really appreciate your interest. We'll continue to execute our strategy, with a focus on services, expanding offerings and operational excellence, to deliver long-term profitable growth. And we look forward to chatting with you again next quarter. Thank you.","Jennifer Driscoll","Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Andrew and everyone who joined us on the call today.

At this time, all lines have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Mike DeWalt","Thank you very much, and good morning everyone, and welcome to our year-end earnings call. This is Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar\u2019s vice president of strategic services. On the call today, I\u2019m pleased to have our chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and group president and CFO, Brad Halverson.","This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. Any use, recording, or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you would like a copy of today\u2019s call transcript, we\u2019ll be posting it in the Investor section of our Caterpillar.com website, in the section labeled Results Webcast.","This morning we\u2019ll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. The discussion of some of the factors that individually, or in the aggregate, could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1-A, Risk Factors, of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2013, and also in the forward-looking statements language continued in today\u2019s release. Now, in addition to that, there\u2019s a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, and that can be found in today\u2019s financial release, which has also been posted on our website at caterpillar.com. ","Okay, let\u2019s get started. And this morning I\u2019ll be covering four main topics before we get to the Q&A. They\u2019re fourth quarter financial results, a recap of 2013, the 2014 sales and profit outlook, and I\u2019ll start this morning with the fourth topic, and that\u2019s the $1.7 billion of stock repurchase that we\u2019re expecting in the first quarter, and the new $10 billion stock repurchase authorization that we announced this morning.","Now, to set the stage for stock repurchase, it\u2019s good to know that we had a great year for cash flow in 2013, and finished the year with a strong balance sheet. We set a new record for machinery and power systems operating cash flow at about $9 billion. And that was about $1 billion more than the previous record, from 2011.","We ended 2013 with a machinery and power systems debt to capital ratio of 29.7%. That\u2019s almost 8 full percentage points below where we ended 2012 and our lowest debt to cap in more than 25 years. You have to go back to 1987 to find a lower one.","2013 was also a year where we repurchased $2 billion in Caterpillar stock and last year we raised the quarterly dividend by 15%. 2013\u2019s cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet underpin this morning\u2019s announcement that we expect to complete our existing stock repurchase authorization and our board\u2019s approval for a new $10 billion program.","So, record cash flow, strong balance sheet, $2 billion of share repurchase in \u201913, plus a number of $1.7 billion expected this quarter, and a new $10 billion authorization. We think that\u2019s all great news for shareholders and a reflection of strong operational performance in 2013 and our confidence over the long term.","Let\u2019s move on to fourth quarter results. And certainly, while 2013 was a tough year, we\u2019re pleased to be ending it on a more positive note, with sales and revenues nearly $700 million above our outlook and profit $0.25 a share above the outlook.","For the quarter, sales and revenues were $14.4 billion, and that\u2019s about $1.7 billion, or about 10%, below the fourth quarter of 2012, which was $16.1 billion. Profit per share was $1.54, and that\u2019s up $0.50 a share from the fourth quarter last year. ","While profit is up, we did have two large items that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 that had a sizable impact on profit. We had the $580 million goodwill impairment that was negative to profit, about $0.87 per share last year, but we had a $300 million favorable tax settlement in 2012, and that helped profit by $0.45 a share. So if you exclude those two large items, our quarter over quarter profit per share improvement was about $0.08.","Now, for sales, more than all the quarter over quarter sales decline was in resource industries, which is principally mining. Resource industry sales were down 48% from the fourth quarter of 2012. That substantial decline was the result of both lower demand from mining customers and from changes in dealer inventory.","While resource industry sales in the fourth quarter were well below the fourth quarter of 2012, they were about the same as the previous quarter, and that was the third quarter of 2013. Sales in each of the past two quarters have been roughly $3 billion for resource industries.","And I\u2019ll talk about the 2014 outlook in a few minutes, but it\u2019s worth noting at this point that the $3 billion a quarter that we\u2019ve seen for the past couple of quarters for resource industries is about what we\u2019re expecting to average in the outlook for 2014. Probably a little below $3 billion a quarter in the first half, and a little better in the second half.","On a much more positive note, fourth quarter sales in construction industries were up 20% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Power system sales were up 5%, and financial products revenues were up 3%. That\u2019s great news, and that demonstrates balance in our business. While we serve a number of cyclical industries, they don\u2019t all move the same way at the same time, and it\u2019s great that construction and power systems were up. ","Now, excluding the goodwill impairment that happened in the fourth quarter of 2012, operating profit declined about $166 million. That\u2019s $166 million on a sales and revenues decline of about $1.7 billion, and there were certainly a number of puts and takes, but overall, we\u2019re pleased with our operational performance and the decremental operating profit pull through of about 10% in the fourth quarter.","Manufacturing costs were favorable, $480 million versus the fourth quarter of 2012, and SG&A and R&D were favorable, combined about $200 million. Cost performance was the main driver of the good decrementals, and that was in a quarter where we didn\u2019t get any help from price realization, which was about neutral, and our sales mix was unfavorable, because more than all of the sales decline was in resource industries and because of mining.","Bottom line for the quarter, resource industries was down, but power systems, construction, and financial products were all better than the fourth quarter of 2012.","Okay, so that\u2019s the quarter. Let\u2019s move on to a recap of the full year, which was a tough one, particularly for our resource industry segment. Back in January of 2013, when we started the year and provided our first outlook, the midpoint of our 2013 range expected sales and revenues to be down from 2012.","In fact, sales in 2013 were down and the decline in mining sales in our resource industry segment was much more significant than we\u2019d expected. As a result, we ended 2013 with sales about $10 billion, or 16%, below 2012, and of that $10 billion, about $8 billion was in resource industries and about $1 billion each was in construction and power systems.","Now, as a result of that $10 billion sales decline, profit was down as well, from $8.48 a share in 2012 to $5.75 in 2013. While profit was down, our operational performance for the year was good. Our decremental operating profit pull through was less than 30% and that was despite a major headwind from product mix.","With most of the year\u2019s sales decline coming from relatively high-margin mining products, the sales mix headwind on profit was about $750 million in 2013 versus 2012. We also had a sizable headwind from negative cost absorption, and that was related to our large inventory reduction in 2013.","We had good performance, despite those headwinds, because we took action on costs. Excluding the cost absorption impact from inventory, our manufacturing, R&D, and SG&A costs were collectively down $1.2 billion in 2013. That $1.2 billion improvement was the result of favorable material costs, lower incentive pay, short term actions that we took, like temporary plant shutdowns and rolling layoffs. And as the year progressed, we started on more structural actions.","The restructuring actions that we took in 2013 resulted in nearly 2,000 fewer management and support employees, 4,500 fewer production employees, and the closing, downsizing, or consolidation of a number of manufacturing facilities.","While those restructuring actions spanned the company, they were more concentrated in resource industries. We incurred $200 million of restructuring costs in 2013, of which about $130 million was in the fourth quarter, and we\u2019re expecting another $400 million to $500 million in 2014.","I\u2019ll talk a bit more about that when I cover the 2014 outlook, but before I do that, I didn\u2019t want to end this recap of 2013 without giving a little rest of the story. While 2013 was a year overshadowed by the big drop in mining, there were a lot of good things that happened at Caterpillar.","First, while mining was negative, we\u2019re a diverse company. We serve a wide range of industries across the globe. And while sales declined in construction and power systems, that decline was small compared with resource industries. Power systems profit was within $50 million of its 2012 record, and our financial product segment delivered record profit in 2013. ","The fourth quarter of 2013 top line for construction, power systems, and financial products, and their bottom lines, were better than the fourth quarter of 2012. I mentioned it earlier, and I think it\u2019s worth mentioning again, it was a great year for cash flow. We set a new record for machinery and power systems, operating cash flow at $9 billion. We repurchased $2 billion of Caterpillar stock in 2013, and we raised the dividend by 15%.","We ended with a strong balance sheet, with over $6 billion in cash, and the lowest debt to capital ratio in 25 years. It was also a year of inventory correction, for both us and for our dealers. We reduced our inventory almost $3 billion and dealers reduced their inventories by more than $3 billion. ","They were significant sales and production headwinds in 2013, but we think the significant impact on our sales is largely over. That doesn\u2019t mean that every quarter we\u2019ll be exactly flat, but overall for the company, we continue to believe that inventory changes will be a big story in 2014, like it was in 2013. ","In 2013, we also improved our market position for CAT machines again, and made particularly strong gains with excavators in China. And speaking of China, our total sales and revenues there in 2013 were about $3.5 billion, and that was up more than 20% from 2012.","From an operational perspective, we also continue to make improvements in safety and quality, and while we understand that quality improvement is continuous, our dealers and customers give us feedback that let us know they\u2019re seeing results.","So, with that recap, let\u2019s move on to the outlook. Overall, sales and revenues in 2014 are expected to be roughly similar with 2013, at about $56 billion. And that would be in a range of about plus or minus 5%. ","There are encouraging signs in the world economy, and we\u2019re seeing some in our own business, and that gives us optimism for sales in our construction and power systems segments, and we think they\u2019ll each be up about 5% in 2014.","However, we continue to be cautious about the mining industry. Despite prospects for the improved economic climate and continued strong production at mines, we are expecting a sales decline in our resource industry segments of about 10% in 2014. ","The good news is, mine production has generally been up and improved in 2013, and we think it will likely be up again in 2014. The bad news is that orders for new equipment remain pretty low. But we don\u2019t think that can go on indefinitely, and we remain positive on our long term view of mining.","Based on the size and age of existing equipment fleets, we believe that miners are buying new equipment at a rate that\u2019s well below the average replacement level they\u2019ll need going forward. As an example, we think that our sales of large mining trucks in 2014 will be around half the long term replacement level. That should be a positive for sales in the future.","In 2013, we took substantial actions to reduce cost, and we\u2019re expecting to take more in 2014. That means that we\u2019re expecting additional restructuring actions and charges in 2014 of $400 to $500 million, and that\u2019s in addition to the $200 million of restructuring costs that we had in 2013.","The most significant item in 2014 is the restructuring of our Gosselies, Belgium facility. We announced that program on December 23 of 2013, and it\u2019s designed to improve the competitiveness of our European manufacturing footprint by refocusing our current Gosselies operations on final machine assembly, test, and paint, with limited component and fabrication operations.","The actions there will include reshaping the supply base for more efficient sourcing, improving factory efficiencies, and workforce reductions. Our proposals are subject to Belgian ministerial approval, and we think a decision by the Belgian minister of employment will occur in the first quarter of 2014. And, subject to that approval, we expect to recognize about $300 million of employee related separation charges throughout 2014.","The remaining restructuring costs of $100 million to $200 million that are anticipated in our outlook are related to a wide range of actions across the company, and a part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations.","While we\u2019re expecting numerous actions, we don\u2019t expect that individually the charges would be significant. We expect that the restructuring actions taken in \u201913 and that we\u2019re anticipating for \u201914 will be about $200 million favorable to our ongoing costs in 2014 and $400 million to $500 million per year favorable to ongoing cost after 2015.","Now, the most significant reason the 2014 impact is lower than the impact after 2015 is the timeframe involved in implementing the program in Gosselies, Belgium. It\u2019s extensive, and it will take several years to complete. In addition, the other actions that we\u2019re expecting to take in 2014 will occur over the course of the year, and as a result, we\u2019re expecting partial year benefits in 2014.","In total, we estimate the after-tax impact of the restructuring charges in 2014 to be between $0.50 and $0.60 a share. Our profit outlook for 2014 is $5.85 a share, at $56 billion of sales and revenues, excluding the $0.55 midpoint of the restructuring charges and about $5.40 per share, all in, including the restructuring.","Now, there are a number of reasonably important moving pieces that are factored into our 2014 outlook, and we\u2019ve provided a listing of those key items in the profit outlook section of this morning\u2019s financial release. And if you haven\u2019t already, I would encourage you to read through that.","So, in summary, on the outlook, $56 billion of sales and revenues in 2014. That\u2019s relatively flat with \u201913, in a range of plus or minus 5%, and $5.85 a share without restructuring, $5.30 all in.","One last point on the outlook, and that\u2019s around the first quarter. For the full year, our sales and revenues outlook expects roughly flat sales. And sales flat with the first quarter of 2013 is probably a reasonable ballpark for you to think about for Q1 2014.","However, as you think about first quarter profit, you may be looking back to the first quarter of 2013 as a reference point. And if you do, there\u2019s one fairly significant item you need to consider, and that\u2019s that last year, we had an $87 million favorable tax item in the first quarter, and that was related to the research and development tax credit that was retroactively extended in 2013 for 2012. And that certainly won\u2019t be in the first quarter of 2014. ","So, that\u2019s the outlook, and we\u2019re ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question today is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays ","Your backlog declined to $18 billion in Q4. It was $19.1 billion in Q3, and it\u2019s down $2.2 billion in the year. Yet you\u2019re guiding to 5% increase in power systems, and you did mention in the release that some of the backlog decline was in power systems. So can you talk about the conviction of your forecast here, especially you do have some decent emerging market exposure in this business. Where is the growth coming from in power systems, and why? ","Mike DeWalt ","It\u2019s probably worth noting that for construction, we still had a headwind in the fourth quarter on dealer inventory. Certainly not as much as it was in the fourth quarter or year ago, but the improvement in the fourth quarter, if we would have had flat dealer inventory, would have been a little bit more.","On power systems, we\u2019re not looking for a big increase next year. We\u2019re in the ballpark of about 5%. And I would tell you that it\u2019s not any one sector. If you look at what\u2019s in power systems, you\u2019ve got industrial, you\u2019ve got oil and gas, [unintelligible], and turbines. You\u2019ve got electric power, you\u2019ve got marine, you\u2019ve got rail. ","And we don\u2019t really have any one of those sectors that up a lot. In fact, probably one of the smallest, which is marine, in the transportation piece, it\u2019s probably a little bit stronger than the rest, but I wouldn\u2019t really call that out too much. They\u2019re all kind of in the same ballpark. ","You asked about conviction and backlog, when we do our outlook, we try to give you our best guess at what we see in our backlog, what we\u2019re hearing from customers, what we think is going to happen in the economy. And we try to put that together and do our best shot. So I would say it\u2019s an outlook, so it\u2019s not a sure thing, but I\u2019d say we\u2019re as confident as we usually are in an outlook.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays ","Just shifting gears, in [unintelligible] you said that you were not expecting a significant inventory changes at the company level. But it still looks like, if I\u2019m doing the math right, that you lowered company inventories by about $700 million in the quarter. Was this mostly in resource industries, and that\u2019s why your margins were so weak there? And how do you get conviction that these kinds of declines are behind you, when you kind of had similar issues all year, with company inventory destocks?","Mike DeWalt","I\u2019d say one thing is our sales in the fourth quarter were higher than we thought, and the change in dealer inventory was about the same as we expected. And with production schedules relatively not changing a lot in the short term, some of that came from inventory. And I\u2019ll tell you what gives us a little bit of conviction that it\u2019s not going to go down as much as last year is essentially the amount of our inventory that is finished goods. ","We\u2019ve got the PDCs, for example. And a year ago, we had a lot of inventory in the PDCs. And it has come down substantially. I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me, but my recollection is that it\u2019s down more than half. So I think that we expected that to happen this year. You know, there will be seasonal fluctuations, but by and large, I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s the likelihood that that finished inventory would come down as much as it did in 2013. ","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Ross Gilardi. ","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America ","Just first on mining, can you talk a bit more about what happened to both OE and aftermarket orders from Q3 to Q4? And do you need a major pickup in orders in the second half of \u201914 to deliver minus 10% for the year on the top line?","Mike DeWalt ","I\u2019m going to pull aftermarket out of this, because for us, aftermarket is kind of a daily thing. Our order board, if you will, is about 24 hours. So customers order, we fulfill and send. So sales are probably a better indicator of the future than what happened on the last day of the year.","So I think if you look at order rates for new equipment, they have remained very very low. That\u2019s despite mine production. Our customers, they\u2019ve actually had pretty decent years. Mine production has been up, and we think it will be up again overall, in 2014. Despite that, they\u2019re not ordering much.","And we haven\u2019t really seen much of a pickup. Certainly, order rates for resource industries were a little better in the fourth quarter than they were in the fourth quarter of the prior year, but that\u2019s not saying much. And so I think to answer your question, we do need some improvement in order rates to be at minus 10, but I wouldn\u2019t describe it as anything like robust or good or like 2012. But yeah, some improvement.","Douglas Oberhelman ","Maybe it\u2019s time for me to just add a comment on mining here in general. The interesting thing with our mining customers, and I have met, in the last 60 to 90 days, with several of my counterpart CEOs at the mining customers, and all of our mining team has been with all of our alliance customers, certainly, over the last 60 to 90 days, in some way or another. ","The feedback is fairly consistent, and it\u2019s not illogical at all. Their mining production continues. They are pulling ores out of the ground at faster and faster rates. They are just doing what we did, frankly, in \u201913, and that\u2019s pull our horns in, pull their horns in, with capex. We see that again in \u201914.","But what they all have cautioned us on is that at some point in the future, because we\u2019re extending cycles, duty cycles, because we\u2019ve cut back on new acquisitions and even some parts in some cases, be ready for us at some point in the future. None of them can predict when that is, and I can\u2019t either. but this is sort of typical with what we hear through these deep cycles. When it\u2019s over, it tends to come back fairly quickly. ","I\u2019m not making that prediction here today. I hope it\u2019s in 2014. I know it will happen in 2014 or 2015, but that\u2019s kind of the quandary we\u2019re in as well, trying to judge from our customers when they feel comfortable kicking back in with new purchases.","Now, capex is going down with miners in 2014, and you\u2019ve all seen the numbers. We watch that too. A big part of capex in mining is not around mobile equipment. So when that turns, I\u2019m convinced we\u2019ll see not, as Mike said, a 2012 style ordering, and I hope we don\u2019t, but we should see a fairly prominent turn, when it happens. ","And as Mike said, we should see something in \u201914 to make our forecast, but it\u2019s out there, we just don\u2019t know when. And I can\u2019t provide any more clarity than that. That\u2019s the feedback we get from our customers. ","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America ","And then just my follow up question on construction equipment, how did you get such a dramatic improvement from Q3 to Q4 in EBIT, on essentially a $300 million sequential increase in revenues? And then more importantly, do you think that $500 million of quarterly EBIT for construction is a sustainable run rate into \u201914, particularly, as you mentioned, with some lingering price pressure in the business?","Mike DeWalt ","For construction, I\u2019ll say a couple of things. They had pretty good incrementals from third to fourth quarter. And there are a couple of things going on in there. Their pricing was a little bit better in the fourth quarter. They had more of this big order from Brazil in the third quarter that kind of dampened price realization a little bit. Again, sales were up. They actually did a great job on costs in the fourth quarter, and the impact on absorption of inventory decline for them was not a big deal in the fourth quarter. There was a little more of that in the third quarter.","But no doubt about it, they had a pretty good quarter. In terms of going forward, I\u2019m going to try not to give any specific guidance on profit by segment, but they were around 10% in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s probably in the ballpark of, you know, we\u2019re not looking for a big decline. They were hurt this year by inventory declines, and we don\u2019t see that happening in 2014. So their margins in 2014 ought to be better.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse ","One, Doug, just philosophically, how should we think about the message you\u2019re trying to send here with the share repurchase? Your views changed quite dramatically since you first became CEO. So should we think about the $10 billion over five year, like $2 billion a year? Would it be more front-end loaded? Would you look to be more opportunistic than the $1.7 billion you already talked about?","And then my second question, Mike, as it relates to guidance, you gave some color on the first quarter. I guess outside of that, is there anything unusual we should think about as we think about the progression of earnings throughout the year? Anything not in line with your typical seasonality? Just given we have restructuring benefits that are going to hit, I\u2019m not sure how that happened, in terms of your saying you\u2019re expecting mining orders to pick up? I\u2019m just trying to make sure we have the quarters correct.","Mike DeWalt ","I\u2019ll take the second part of that, on the guidance. Of the $200 million ongoing benefit that we kind of expected for this year, a lot of that is based on the things that we did in 2013. So those kind of things are in place, the big reductions in people that we had. So I think that $200 million, I probably wouldn\u2019t divide it by four, because we are doing more in 2014. But you know, I would say, if you divided it by four and then favored the second half of the year a little bit more than the first half, that\u2019s probably reasonable.","Probably the biggest issue on timing that we\u2019re going to have during the year is when the actual restructuring charges for \u201914 hit. I mentioned in the preamble that we need to have the Belgian government improve our program. And so until that happens, we won\u2019t be booking the charges for Gosselies. So that needs to happen.","Outside of that, I don\u2019t know of any real big items. I do think that the first quarter, for example, will have more negative sales mix, likely, than the second half, a little bit. The first quarter of last year, mining was still quite a bit higher than it is right now. So I kind of was talking about the first quarter sales being relatively flat, but that\u2019s with mining being down a bit, and construction being up.","Douglas Oberhelman ","Thanks for a thoughtful question on our buyback and cash. Let me give you a fairly broad answer to that, and I hope complete. I have changed my position since I became CEO. You\u2019ll recall when that announcement was made, it was the end of 2009. Our debt to cap was way over 50% at that time. We struggled to be sure we kept our credit rating, and we vowed not to cut the dividend at that time, and both of those came true.","But as we look forward, we all agreed that we had to have a strong balance sheet. A cycle like we saw in \u201909 and now another mining cycle like we saw in \u201913 really puts pressure on our balance sheet and we decided we\u2019ve got to have a rock solid balance sheet, which we do today. You\u2019ll notice at the end of the year it dropped below 30% debt to cap. If you take our cash into consideration, of about $6 billion at the end of the year, it was down 16% to 17%. And in my definition, that\u2019s a pretty solid balance sheet. ","So we accomplished that. The second thing that we needed to do in the early days of me being CEO was to build up our capacity. We struggled with capacity, we did not have adequate capacity in the upturn of the 2000s. We gave up market share around the world. And our business model purely runs on field population, which allows our dealers to do what they do in a downturn, better than anybody else, but by servicing the field population that\u2019s out there.","We accomplished that one. We\u2019ve got capacity in place today, obviously far above $55 billion. We did $66 billion in 2012, so somewhere north of that, we have operating capacity today. We\u2019re capacitized just right. Our capex has come down substantially as a result of that.","So I think where we\u2019re positioned today going forward is significantly different than where we\u2019ve been for a while, and as a result, seeing cash build up on the balance sheet is not healthy. That\u2019s one of the reasons when we had strong cash last year the two quarters, we announced buyback, we spent $2 billion. As we announced today, we\u2019ll spend $1.7 billion more this quarter, which will take full advantage of our 2007 buyback program. And we announced another $10 billion today, of course, over the next five years or so.","I\u2019m not going to make any prediction on when we\u2019re going to do that, but as long as we see fairly stable and consistent cash flow, which I expect we would, as long as we keep our debt-to-cap in the low 30s, that allows us to acquire, if we choose to do so, and that\u2019s another question that\u2019s kind of embedded in yours, we do not have anything at all big on the horizon. I\u2019d say we\u2019d be back in the mode we have been for many years, a number of acquisitions possible, all relatively small in size. ","In fact, we hold a placeholder every year of about $1 billion for acquisitions. Sometimes we go that high, sometimes we don\u2019t. But we will be looking for acquisition opportunities, I would say particularly around power systems. That\u2019s a great business for us, it\u2019s very stable, obviously. There\u2019s some places to expand. We\u2019ve got lots of opportunity around the world, so that might be a place, again, in a smaller way, not a huge way, that we might do it. ","And so I\u2019d say that, if we get lucky, that every year we buy a little bit back. But I\u2019ll make no forecast on that. We have cash. We\u2019ll probably use it. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll probably wait. And that\u2019s kind of how I\u2019d look at all of that. Great question, thank you.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from David Raso.","David Raso - ISI Group ","Regarding resource industries, if you add back the restructuring in the fourth quarter, the margin was about 7%. Can you give us some help on how you\u2019re thinking about the margins for RI if the revenue, as you said earlier, would stay around the same level that we saw in the fourth quarter?","Mike DeWalt ","I would say that fourth quarter usually has a little higher cost levels than the rest of the year. And with sales for resource industries kind of coming down to this $3 billion level, it has a little bit bigger impact on margin. So they had a little more of an inventory decline. That hurt in the fourth quarter. They had costs that were up a little bit in the fourth quarter. So that was a little negative from the third quarter. And as you mentioned, the restructuring charges that they had in the fourth quarter.","In terms of going forward, at this volume level, if you were to take the sort of average margin for the year, it\u2019s probably not far off of what you\u2019d think for next year. There will be puts and takes, though. They\u2019ve done a lot of work on cost reduction. So that would be a positive. They would like to spend a little bit more to drive synergy benefits and spend a little more on R&D. So that will go the other way. But I think by and large their margins, from 2013, are not significantly out of line at this kind of sales level.","David Raso - ISI Group ","It\u2019s a little tricky though. If you think construction margins can be 10%, roughly, in \u201914, that implies a incremental margin for CI of 65% next year. That seems aggressive. But then if you really think RI can do margins of 11 to 14, it implies power systems margins are down to 13 next year, after being 15. So the math\u2019s not squaring up.","Mike DeWalt ","I\u2019m not trying to give you specific numbers. I didn\u2019t say that construction would be 10. I just said I think it will be probably closer to that than the 5% to 6% that they had earlier in the year. I think also one of the things that you need to remember kind of year over year too is there are other things that are maybe not in the segments. We had pretty substantial negative below operating profit currency losses in 2013 that we\u2019re not expecting for 2014. So I don\u2019t think, from an operating profit standpoint, there will be major changes, but I\u2019m not suggesting it will be exactly the same in each segment as it was in the fourth quarter. ","David Raso - ISI Group ","How about just qualitatively, then? Power systems, how do you think their margins, off of the 15.4 you reported for 2013?","Mike DeWalt ","Again, I don\u2019t think it will be substantially different. Again, I\u2019m not trying to do a forecast by segment. But probably not substantially different. It was a great quarter. I don\u2019t want to pick on the quarter, but if you were to take the year, I don\u2019t think their profit is going to be dramatically different year over year.","David Raso - ISI Group ","And lastly, for ConExpo, any framework we should be thinking about going into a meeting like this? Historically, you\u2019ve spoken of long term targets before, in settings like this. Can you give us a little framework for this year?","Mike DeWalt ","Yeah, I think generically, what we\u2019ll talk about is our strategy update. We\u2019ve been working on that for the last several months of 2013. So we\u2019ll spend time updating you on the changes that we made to the strategy, and we\u2019ll talk a little bit about each of the major segments. And it will be kind of a longer term view, what we expect for the future. But coming out of such a tough year in 2013, I remember this back in 2009, when we had a similar meeting, we kind of gave specific number targets, and it was tough to get anybody to think the business could be that big, or that good. ","So I think what you\u2019ll probably hear from us at ConExpo is more around strategy, business conditions, and the things that we expect to do going forward. It probably won\u2019t be so much a here\u2019s a forecast for a particular year.","Douglas Oberhelman ","That\u2019s right, and a couple of things. We\u2019ll talk about how our business has changed since [unintelligible], and how we see it kind of, to use your word, qualitatively going forward. But one other thing I\u2019d ask all of you to do while you\u2019re out there, those of you who are attending. Go down on the floor and look at our product offering. ","You\u2019ll be seeing a couple of things that you haven\u2019t seen from us before. Number one, fuel economy. Frankly, we have struggled in the past to get some of our competition on fuel economy. That period is over. Our tier four interim and final machines that you\u2019ll see out there are, in almost every case, best in class, and best in class by quite a margin. So I\u2019d really like you to spend time with our people on the floor.","Secondly, equipment technology. Condition monitoring, job site, controls, everything around the electronics. We\u2019ll operate a live dealer control room there. It\u2019s [unintelligible], but it would look like a control room like we have all over the world today, monitoring our machines and what we can offer customers. And those two are very different than what we\u2019ve talked about in the past. ","And then our meeting, I think you\u2019ll enjoy kind of a little look back at how we\u2019ve changed the company and where we\u2019re going, as Mike said, between here and the next few years out.","David Raso - ISI Group ","And Doug, if you can help us, at ConExpo, or even right now, the strategy comment reminded me of, it appears that the majority of your dealers in China have dropped the SEM brand. You still have the original SEM dealers selling. That\u2019s probably why you\u2019re still doing okay in China. But SEM obviously been lagging the industry data, I guess in part because the traditional CAT dealers, the majority have dropped it. ","And thinking of SEM as maybe a lower cost solution, cost structure, around the world, do you care to maybe comment a little bit on that SEM decision by the CAT dealers, how it makes you rethink your kind of lower value price point strategy?","Douglas Oberhelman ","Yeah, and I\u2019ll make sure that Ed addresses that at ConExpo. But generally, we encourage that change, from here. The market is huge over there for excavators and the things that CAT brand does, and we\u2019ve decided over the last year that that\u2019s really where we want them to focus. We went kind of back to a strategy of SEM brand for SEM products, inside and outside, although we still have quite a few dealers outside of China representing SEM. That has worked well for us. We\u2019ll concentrate on that as a brand. ","It is a value brand, and of course we\u2019ve been upgrading that technology a little bit within the value offering against SEM\u2019s competitors. So we think we\u2019re in a better position with that going forward, and again, that will be a relatively small play in the scheme of things, but it\u2019s important inside China. ","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Nicole DeBlase. ","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley ","I just wanted to ask a question on material costs. I think you guys noted in the 2014 outlook of the release that you expect material costs to be favorable in \u201914. But you\u2019re also looking for an improving economic environment, and usually that causes commodity prices to increase. So I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re expecting for material costs, and why you expect a decline.","Mike DeWalt ","We didn\u2019t actually put it in the economic part of the release, but generally speaking, I would say, for mined commodities, like copper, for example, we\u2019re expecting commodity prices for \u201914 to be by and large around the 2013 average. So we\u2019re not likely to get big increases or decreases in commodity prices, at least that\u2019s our view.","And so for material costs, you kind of have to look a little bit at how things have trended for the year. We\u2019ve gotten kind of better and better as we\u2019ve gone through the year. We\u2019re exiting the year, 2013, at a lower level than where we came into the year. So even if we don\u2019t get any other cost reductions at all, we have a bit of a carryover benefit that comes from the prior year.","So that should be positive. And in addition to that, most of what we buy is not commodities, believe it or not. It\u2019s components that have a lot of value added in it. And based on what we\u2019ve negotiated with suppliers, the changes that we\u2019ve made, we\u2019re looking for overall material costs to be lower. And again, the bulk of what we buy is not commodities, it includes somebody else\u2019s value added. And so a combination of reductions there and what we\u2019re coming out of \u201913 with already give us pretty good confidence on the material costs for \u201914.","Bradley Halverson ","And I may just add quickly, you know, coming out of the strategy with Doug, a big part of it was supplier collaboration, and the idea that we would get to know our suppliers as well as we know our dealers. And we spent a significant amount of time on that coming out of the strategy. So what we see in terms of our material cost reduction is really a benefit of coming out with stronger supplier collaboration. Their resources, their expertise, combined with ours, is producing a lot better decisions for us, and a big piece of that reduction. ","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley ","And then just on construction with respect to pricing, I saw in the release that you guys called out that there is some pricing degradation or challenges in the North American market too, which I think was isolated to Europe before. So if you could just provide us with an update on what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive environment in North America, that would be helpful.","Mike DeWalt ","I think overall, for construction, there\u2019s not really been anywhere where we\u2019ve had a lot of strength. I think it\u2019s been a tough environment around the world, North America included. We have had some issues here and there where we came out with tier four products in North America before some of our competitors. Some of our competitors had credits that they were using to sell tier three products over a longer period of time. So as that expires, as I\u2019d say everybody gets on a more equal footing with regard to tier four, I think that will probably help us a little bit in North America, because it\u2019s been a little bit of a drag.","Operator","Our next question today is going to come from Alex Potter.","Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray ","I had a question on China in general. There\u2019s been this downtick in PMI, obviously bearishness around emerging markets that has surfaced here just over the last week or so. But your commentary on China seemed at least relatively upbeat. Asia Pacific construction business is up really nicely in Q4. Power gen seemed to be holding up okay sequentially. So basically I\u2019m just trying to see if you\u2019ve seen anything recently to substantiate these initial signs of weakness in China.","Mike DeWalt ","The market reaction has really occurred over the past week or 10 days or so. I think in our business, it\u2019s been pretty positive. We\u2019ve seen not just our sales but kind of the overall construction equipment group sales in the industry ticking up year over year, over the past few months. And we saw that again in December. So I think what we\u2019ve seen has been pretty good. We\u2019ve done better than the market there as well. Our sales in China were up more than 20% this year. They were up in the quarter. So you know, it\u2019s not been a big negative for us.","Now, the flipside of that is, we\u2019re not looking for improvements in overall GDP for China. We\u2019re more expecting 2014 to be another year like 2013, like 2012. You know, in that sort of 7.5%-ish range. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in China, anyway.","Douglas Oberhelman ","Let me add a little bit on China. We are watching it very, very closely from a couple of aspects. Obviously liquidity in the banking system, and we keep a close eye on that, as well as their reform efforts. And we have been laser focused on being a leader in China, and that\u2019s, again, around building field population. ","So we have seen our market share go up, our field population go up, and our business go up as a result. That is not to say China is not without lots of caution, which we are very much aware of, and we watch that every day. But at the same time, we have to have our dealers, with a field population they can work on, when times are bad or good. So that\u2019s really our focus, is that business model inside China. ","Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray ","Last question here. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on power systems, maybe just qualitatively. Which segments, looking into 2014, do you expect to perform better, perform worse, and some of the [unintelligible] or reasoning behind that.","Mike DeWalt ","I think with the exception of industrial, which has had just a really really big up year this year, and is going to happen really tough comps as a result, I think we\u2019re essentially looking year over year,\u201914 versus \u201913, no really outliers. We have power systems overall up, we think, about 5%. And you know, for the big kind of subsectors, it\u2019s not going to veer far off that. So with the exception of maybe marine, might be a little bit better, industrial might be a little bit worse, the rest of them, oil and gas overall, electric power overall, rail overall, kind of up a little.","Douglas Oberhelman ","Just a qualitative comment about power systems. Really sparkled in a tough year like 2013. And if you look back over the years, power systems has done that. Because there\u2019s a fairly wide array of businesses in there. Take our rail business, between progress rail and EMD, EMD, in its third year of ownership, is just getting it done. We\u2019ve seen a lot of cost reduction in locomotives, we\u2019ve seen a lot of work around the aftermarket, kind of building up the Caterpillar DNA into locomotives. And we\u2019re very, very happy with that acquisition and our current market position. ","Electric power has been very anemic, as you all know, but within that is our acquisition of MWM in Germany, which brings us a natural gas and gas in any form offering. We\u2019re building that out, expanding through CAT theaters. Long term, that\u2019s going to be a very good piece of business for us. And, again, kind of countercyclical to everything else in the power systems business.","Our industrial business, which is really the reciprocating engines that we sell to everybody from ag to lift trucks, to other construction equipment makers, saw an increase in 2013 to make up for some of the shortfalls in the other segments. So within that power systems business, there\u2019s a ray of diversity.","And then finally, the turbine business, which has just been fantastic for us, really the whole time we\u2019ve owned it, going back to the mid-80s. But with the oil and gas boom, the fracking boom, around this country and elsewhere, that has been a real stellar performer the last few years, and I expect it to continue.","And then just an anecdote. I just returned from the Eagle Ford area, actually last week, and I had my ears to the ground on what they\u2019re seeing down there. And actually our dealers there are a bit more optimistic than I expected. I\u2019m not going to say wildly at all, but there\u2019s still activity going on, and they feel like \u201914 could be another solid year. So that\u2019s anecdotal, but certainly a positive thing at this point in time.","But our power systems business is one that we\u2019re very happy with, and again, within that, it\u2019s kind of a complete and various array of businesses in itself.","Operator","Our next question today is from Robert Wertheimer.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners ","I wonder if I could follow up on what Doug was just mentioning. There\u2019s a little bit of consternation in the market with some of the big oil majors talking about maybe declining returns on some of the expensive capex, maybe cutting back, and maybe some of the other segments in oil and gas being strong. Are you able to delineate your exposure to the big international oil companies? And maybe you could just say is [Solar] set to have another record year?","Douglas Oberhelman ","Yeah, I\u2019d say, at this point in time, as Mike said also, our power systems in \u201914 ought to look a lot like it did in \u201913. We\u2019re hopeful for a very modest increase, but that\u2019s after a lot of gives and takes across that business. ","As you all know, the fracking business has changed the gas pipeline and gas compression business immensely in this country. And there\u2019s still a lot of buildout on getting that gas out of the ground, and that\u2019s what I think we\u2019re seeing primarily around solar. The big nationals around the world certainly are questioning where they\u2019re going, and we see that. I\u2019ve got to believe the opening in Mexico, when that starts, because I do think they will pull that off, is going to change the dynamics completely again. ","And that could be some upside, although I don\u2019t know how much of that we\u2019d see in \u201914. It ought to start. So really, I think you almost have to look at it country by country and see where that goes. But we\u2019re not wildly optimistic about it, nor are we that pessimistic for \u201914.","I have been surprised with gas here the last month or so, going above $5. I would not have predicted that at all, but it\u2019s quite interesting. I don\u2019t know what that will do, but I think it\u2019s probably a fairly short term phenomenon, based on the cold weather. ","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners ","And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re willing to answer this or not, and you have given a decent amount of mining information, but there are concerns that there\u2019s a couple more years of capex decline out there, and obviously your sales have already maybe front loaded some of that decline, having fallen so far. Are you willing to say how far your unit deliveries in mining have fallen from peak in \u201912 to what your outlook is in \u201914? It\u2019s more than 50%, I\u2019m sure. It\u2019s probably more than 60%. Maybe it\u2019s more than 70%. I don\u2019t know. Maybe you can help out?","Mike DeWalt ","I\u2019ll help you maybe a little bit, Rob. We have a varied business, you know. It\u2019s everything from drag lines to drills to big trucks to shovels. The largest selling product category for us is large mining trucks. And if you look at large mining trucks, and you look at what we\u2019ve shipped this year, which would be relatively lined up with what our sales are, we\u2019re down probably close to 60% in \u201913 versus the peak. And if you look at what we kind of have baked into 2014, you\u2019re looking at something like 75% below the 2013 peak for our shipments.","Bradley Halverson ","When we look at our resource industry business, you know, we\u2019ll give you a forecast which is our best estimate in terms of that particular time. But from an operational standpoint, we clearly understand there\u2019s risk. We knew there was risk in \u201913, if you were in the resource industry business. And in that business unit, they started taking action in the first quarter. The companies joined in, and we really focused on structural cost reduction. And with that, we were able to deliver the $1.2 billion of cost reduction. ","And I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019re bullish in mining in the longer term. Mike talked about our orders need to increase for the 10% down scenario. And we\u2019ll walk into the first quarter in a cautious standpoint, and we\u2019ll remains focused on cost reduction around here. But clearly, longer term, we see that as a great business for us. But we remain cautious, and we remain focused on the structural cost reduction in \u201914.","Mike DeWalt ","Okay, with that, we are just past the top of the hour, and we\u2019ll sign off. Thank you very much for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing many of you at ConExpo in March. "],"4522":["Caterpillar, Inc.

And welcome to the Caterpillar Second Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. The floor will be open for your questions and comments following the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Thank you, Anthony. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Financial Services. On the call today I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman and Group President and CFO Brad Halverson.","Now this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. Any use, recording, or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the investor section of our caterpillar.com website. And it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","This morning we'll be discussing forward-looking information, and that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, that's Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of this year, and also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can be found in our financial release today, and that's also been posted at our caterpillar.com website.","Okay. Let's get started. This morning we'll be reviewing our results for the second quarter and our outlook for 2015. For the quarter, sales and revenues were $12.3 billion and profit per share was $1.16, and that was $1.27 excluding restructuring costs. Both of those numbers were about as about what we expected. No big surprises.","In fact, from a macro standpoint, much of what we were expecting when 2015 started seems to be playing out. We expected that mining would continue to be very weak, and it certainly has. We were concerned about weakening sales of construction equipment in China and Brazil, and both are down substantially from last year. With the sharp drop in oil prices from last fall, we expected we'd have sales headwinds in our energy and transportation segment and in construction equipment sales in the parts of the world where oil production was important, and that's happening.","Now on the plus side, we also expected that our people would continue to execute on the things that we can control. And we've done that with decremental margins better than our target. Machinery, Energy & Transportation operating cash flow of $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and a balance sheet that remains healthy with a debt-to-cap ratio near 35%.","So with that introduction behind us, let's get into a little more detail on the quarter. Again, sales and revenues were 13% lower than last year. The decline was widespread with lower sales in every geographic region of the world, and down versus last year in each of our business segments.","We'll start with Construction Industries, which was down 18% and down in all regions. Latin America was the most significant decline, down 47%, and that was mostly a result of weak demand in general, and in particular Brazil, and also absent of a large order that we had from the Brazilian government from last year. Asia-Pacific region was down 30%, with much of that decline in China and Japan. In China the construction industry continued to weaken and in Japan the main issue was currency exchange as the yen weakened versus the dollar and our sales that are denominated in yen there are translating into fewer dollars.","In the Europe, Africa, Middle East region, Construction Industry sales were down 18%, and much of that was from currency translation as local currencies, particularly the euro, were weaker than the dollar compared with the second quarter of last year. In addition, there was some unfavorable dealer inventory change in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region.","Now North America was off 3% and we have seen some strength in residential and nonresidential construction, but that's been offset or slightly more than offset by a drop in sales to customers serving oil and gas. In Resource Industries, which is mostly mining, sales were down 11% versus the second quarter of 2014 and mining sales continue to weaken for both new equipment and to a lesser degree for aftermarket parts.","Sales related to quarry and aggregates did improve, but it wasn't enough to offset the decline in mining. In Resource Industries sales were down in all regions. Suffice to say that mining remains weak around the world and we haven't yet seen signs of a recovery. If you would like a little more regional flavor, there is more in the Resource Industries section in this morning's financial release.","For Energy & Transportation, sales were down 12%. And while down in all regions, I think probably the most useful way to cover energy and transportation is by major industry, and that's oil and gas, transportation, power gen and industrial sales.","In short, sales in each of these industries was down and in order of magnitude, the most significant decline was for transportation and that was mostly lower locomotive sales in North America. Locomotive sales last year in 2014 were pretty good. In 2015, regulations for emissions changed in the United States, and Tier 4 started. And our tier locomotive isn't expected to be available until later in 2016, so sales this year are down.","Now oil and gas related sales were also lower, and that's probably not surprising to you, given the decline in oil prices over the past year and softening investment by oil producers. Sales of industrial engines also declined, and just for your reference, we sell these industrial engines to ag customers, electric power packagers, construction and material handling customers, and for a wide variety of other application. And in general, demand was down a bit and currency also had an unfavorable impact, particularly in Europe.","Power generation sales were also down, and most of that was currency translation related. Again in Europe in particular, where our euro-based sales translated into fewer dollars. Okay, that's a summary of sales and revenues. Again all-in-all about as we expected for the quarter and down about 13% from last year.","Profit in the quarter was $1.16. We did have $0.11 a share or $89 million of restructuring costs and without restructuring, profit was $1.27. Now profit is down from a year ago, while we were $1.57 all in, and $1.69 last year in the second quarter excluding restructuring.","Operating profit declined from $1.475 billion in the second quarter last year to $1.13 billion this year. Now, that's a drop of $345 million. More than all that decline, $483 million in total, was a result of lower sales volume. In addition, Financial Products was down $49 million. R&D costs were a little bit higher than the second quarter of last year as well.","Now on the favorable side for operating profit, price realization was a positive. It was $84 million, certainly in the right direction, but less than 1% of sales. Manufacturing costs were slightly favorable and would have been more so if not for a headwind from inventory absorption, and that was a result of an increase in our inventory over the course of the second quarter of 2014, and a decline in inventory in the second quarter of 2015.","Let's talk about currency for a moment. While the impact on sales was negative, over $400 million, it was actually positive to operating profit about $80 million, and that's because we have a significant cost base outside the US and a stronger US dollar causes those costs to translate into fewer dollars. And that more than offset the negative impact on sales.","Now there are other currency impacts in our P&L as well, below operating profit. And other income and expense, again below operating profit, quarter-over-quarter was unfavorable $78 million. And most of that was related to currency translation on our balance sheet position and hedging. So in summary on balance, relative to profit currency didn't have much of an impact second quarter to second quarter. Okay. That's profit versus last year and the major story is sales volume.","So let's turn to the outlook and that will be actually pretty easy to cover because little has actually changed. Back in January with our original outlook, we expected sales and revenues of about $50 billion. And at the end of the first quarter, we held that. This morning we lowered about $1 billion to $49 billion. The most important point in that is, for the most part, the change is currency related. The dollar strengthened some in the first quarter and strengthened a bit more in the second quarter particularly against the yen, and it's moved enough versus our original outlook that we needed to reflect it in today's updated outlook for the year.","Now sitting here about halfway through the year, except for currency impacts, the overall sales and revenues outlook is still pretty close to what we expected when we started the year. While we would have liked to have been surprised to the upside, our sales outlook of six months ago is proving to be pretty accurate so far, particularly given the degree of uncertainty in the world and the things that we expected would happen in 2015, including: world economic growth that wasn't much different than 2014, the impact of lower oil prices on Energy & Transportation and Construction Equipment sales, lower mining sales, headwinds in China and Brazil and the decline in locomotive sales.","Now, profit in the outlook is being held flat with what we expected at the end of the first quarter, and that's $4.70 a share or $5 a share excluding restructuring. While that's unchanged from last quarter, it is up from our original outlook from January, which was $4.60 a share or $4.75 without restructuring. And I mentioned it a few minutes ago and I think it's probably worth repeating while we're talking about the outlook, what happened in the second quarter for sales and profit is about what we were expecting when we were on this call three months ago.","Now if you consider the full-year outlook and actual results for the first half, it's evident that we're expecting lower sales and profit in the second half of the year. Excluding restructuring costs, our outlook would reflect about $1.24 decline in profit per share first half to second half. And that's a result of lower sales in the second half, about $1 billion, seasonal cost patterns, the first quarter is usually a pretty light quarter for costs and the fourth quarter is seasonally higher, and that includes R&D costs.","We have the absence of the gain in the first quarter on the sale of our remaining interest in the third-party logistics business. We do expect some negative sales mix in the second half, particularly related to oil and gas. That will likely decline more in the second half than it has in the first half. And we're expecting more negative inventory absorption. We're forecasting a decent sized inventory decline, that's Caterpillar inventory, in the second half of the year more than the first half of the year.","Now, in terms of how the next two quarters are going to play out, we think that sales will be less in the third quarter than the fourth quarter, about $750 million lower. And that's not unusual. Just for example, in 2014, last year, sales in the third quarter were about $700 million below the fourth quarter.","Now as a result of lower sales in the third quarter, third quarter's likely to be our lowest profit quarter for the year. As expected, again 2015 is turning out to be another challenging year. We're serving several industries that at the moment are weak: mining, oil and gas, and in many parts of the world, construction. Again, particularly China and Brazil.","We are, however, executing on the things that are more in our control. We've taken substantial restructuring actions and more are likely. We're improving quality, safety and our market position for many of our products. We're also generating cash. Our machinery, energy and transportation operating cash flow again was $1.6 billion in the quarter. And given the weakness in many of our businesses right now, we don't need cash to deploy for capacity and our balance sheet is strong. Our ME&T debt-to-cap ratio is near 35%, well within our target range. And we have $7.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter.","And that brings me to the other announcement we made this morning, and that's our intention to repurchase another $1.5 billion of stock in the third quarter. Now that plus what we've repurchased in the first half should take us to around $2 billion by the time we get to the end of the third quarter. And as a reminder, we did increase the quarterly dividend in the second quarter, and that was back in June. We took it up $0.10 (sic) [10%] (15:09) from $0.70 a quarter to $0.77, and if you annualize that, it's a rate of about $3.08 a share.","So in summary, sales and profit in the second quarter about as we expected. No change in the profit outlook for the year, $1.6 billion of ME&T operating cash flow in the quarter, $1.5 billion share repurchase, 10% increase in the dividend. We think we've done pretty well with the economic and industry climate we have to work with. We've improved our market position and our operations. Now, all that said, we'd certainly be happy to see a better global economy.","So, with that, we are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time on the questions. I guess a couple questions. Just more broadly, can you guys talk about I guess, Mike, when you're thinking about the second half of the year, can you talk about oil and gas, the decline that we saw in the second quarter relative to what you expect in the second half?","And then what is implied in your profitability in the second half of the year with regard to oil and gas? I feel like before you said it would be more in the reciprocating engine side and you still expected Solar and the Marine business to be up. Has that mix changed at all?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Yeah, I would say in general what we said before about the resi business for drilling and well servicing, that's where the brunt of the decline is going to be felt. And we had a pretty sizable backlog of that coming into the year, and that's actually helped sales in the first half. So we're going to see more of the decline in that reset business in the second half. And that goes back to my comment on sales mix in the second half. So that will likely be a bit more negative.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then, I'm sorry, your visibility specifically on Solar right now, and I'm assuming Solar is still good relative?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Yeah, I'd say everything that we've said about Solar this year and holding up and a backlog is still the case. I'm going to try not to get too far ahead of ourselves into a discussion about 2016. We don't have an outlook in front of us for 2016. And that's not trying to avoid that question, it's just we commonly do that with our October third quarter release, kind of give a preview of what we think for the next year. That said, if you do look at backlogs and what's happened, you don't see Solar falling apart. It's marching along reasonably well so far this year. I wouldn't say there's anything that I've seen that I would consider to be alarming, if that helps.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then I guess just, can I ask a second question? Just, I guess broadly, Doug, on mining we've seen a lot of the mining data points continue to deteriorate, what you're hearing from your customers as well as your competition. I guess, Doug, what would you need to see to change your longer-term view on mining and to take sort of a more aggressive restructuring within Caterpillar? And as we think about, I know you're spending this year for the long-term. Do you feel like the brunt of the spend in mining in terms of new products and R&D, does that go away in 2015 so 2016 has less of a headwind? Thanks. And I'll get back in queue.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Around mining, most of the restructuring we have taken to date has been aimed at mining. A number of facilities have been downsized, closed and have been announced to do so this year and next year. We'll continually view that. What we're hearing from customers of course and seeing from customers is an ongoing fairly high production rate. Now I don't know how long that will hold up, but so far we haven't seen a big drop in production. We've certainly seen no expansion and won't for the foreseeable future. But we have not seen any, or I guess, we have seen our trucks and ancillary equipment especially being used longer and longer and longer. Service intervals are being extended. As long as we see that, we know there is a replacement cycle coming at some point. It's just extended.","In terms of where do we see this long-term, I think a lot of that's going to depend on what we see for long-term growth rate and is the world going to grow at 2% for the next 10 years or is it going to grow at 3% or something else. And I think we'll continue to monitor that. We do that right now and particularly as we go into 2016, we'll take a look at that towards the end of the year. But that would be the driver of how fast and how much mining is going to require over the next decade or so and then thus the supply of equipment to them.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Okay, next question please.","Operator","Our next question's from Joel Tiss. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Sorry, I was on mute. Bank of Montreal. How's it going, guys?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Good, Joel. What's up?","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I was just in Asia and there's this whole, I guess it's a little old, but I'm old, too. But I'm a little behind the curve probably, but they're talking about expanding, like giving countries money to help expand their infrastructure, and dragging a lot of the Chinese overcapacity and the Chinese suppliers with them. And so not stopping at the Chinese border, going all the way, Africa, Eastern Europe, former Soviet republics. So as long as Doug is here, I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about, does China bring you guys along with them because you are a local Chinese supplier as they go to these different regions? Or are you already there and can effectively compete with them? Like how does this play out over the next decade?","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Joel. I think you're referring primarily to the Asian Infrastructure Bank, AIIB, which was announced a year or so ago. It's been funded now and run by the Chinese. It's a somewhat similar bank to the several regional banks that are around, whether it's Latin America or Asia, or to some degree World Bank. They are focusing certainly around Asian infrastructure. We are there. Our business model works very well.","I think a significant piece of this is aimed at the Silk Road, the new Silk, one belt, one road project. It's probably a 50-year project going forward. My expectation would be that we're a local Chinese company. Our dealers service products throughout that region and when it comes down to it and they build infrastructure, complete those kinds of things funded by that AIIB that the best supplier's going to win the construction equipment just like anything else. Now will there be bias in another direction? Probably, as we see today that we do pretty well in China.","So my expectation is that that's China trying to take its investments even more broadly than they have been doing. We've done pretty well with that around the world so far, and that would be my expectation going forward. Having said that, a bit political. It would be nice to see the United States involved with that. We've not been. A lot of the European countries have joined in, and most Asians have joined in to aim at areas that need a lot of development. And that I hope is in our future. But again, a little bit off the subject but is I think pertinent to the answer.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Thanks, Joel.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I can't do a quick follow up? Okay. Fine. Thank you.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Yeah, go ahead.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I just wondered if, Mike, this isn't giving away 2016 guidance, but can you share with us what the energy book-to-bill has been in those two different, in the recip engines and in Solar?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Well, definitely for recip engines, the backlog has been going down. That's probably no surprise. I mean, we haven't got a lot of new orders for oil and gas over the last six months as the oil price has declined and investment is beginning to dry up. So our backlog has definitely come down for the recip side, not so much for Solar.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe O'Dea. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. It's Vertical Research. First question just on mining, and in the press release talking about both equipment and aftermarket being down. I think for a little while now aftermarket has been trending more flat. And so just looking for any context around those aftermarket trends in the quarter, whether this is the beginning of another chapter of declines given commodity movement over the last six months, or if those decline rates are actually pretty small?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Yeah, good question, Joe. And I wish honestly we had a crystal ball where I could give you a very crisp answer for that. I think I'll refer back to Doug's comment a bit ago around customers delaying maintenance intervals and repair intervals. And that's going to in our view, that's going to catch up. I know that's a little bit of a broken record and we've been saying that. But fundamentally, the more they run this equipment, and the longer those repair and maintenance intervals go, the more pressure there's going to be. I don't think anything fundamentally has changed. They still need to repair and maintain vehicles, but I think they're pushing it a little harder right now.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe just as a follow up on the power gen side. North America and Asia-Pac both flat in the quarter. I think this is on the heels of actually several years of seeing weakness in power gen. So really just asking your confidence in finding any sort of bottom and any visibility you have into improving demand in power gen?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Yeah, I think for power gen, and I'll just make my comment sort of an around the world comment here. It's very dependent or reasonably tied to global GDP. We've not seen much improvement generally. We've got a pretty flattish world economy. If you think about electric power and a lot of it is backup power. When you build a new school, when you build a new shopping mall, you build a new factory, you need backup power and until you have maybe an improvement in construction around the world, you're probably not going to see much of a big improvement in electric power. Now that said, it was the least unfavorable in the quarter of the sectors under Energy & Transportation. And a lot of the decline was actually currency in Europe. So it's been from a demand standpoint I think more flattish than some of the others.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Next question please. Hello?","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, it's Goldman Sachs. You folks have spent a lot of time on supplier development. Can you just give us an update on how much more room you have to reduce material costs beyond raw material deflation? So obviously, steel costs coming down will help you folks in the back half of the year and maybe you could also touch on what kind of steel price you're assuming in the guidance over the balance of the year. Thanks.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Yeah, Jerry, good question. If you look at our results over the past actually about three years, we've gotten pretty decent what we call material cost reduction. That's really been a combination of a couple of things. We have had commodity declines over the last few years, but we've actually as a company, throughout the company done a pretty good job on not just commodity-related price reductions, but actually cost-reducing components in our products. And we've got pretty good cost reduction doing that. So that's a lot of work between suppliers, purchasing, our engineering group to take costs beyond inflation and commodities out of the product. That continues this year. I think our expectation is there's still quite a bit of room to go there. That's always an ongoing effort. Above and beyond that, it does rely a little bit on what's going on with commodities, but I think there's still a lot of room to run there.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would just add here a little bit. We reorganized our procurement, our logistics and our lean manufacturing group a while back and we are really seeing the benefits of that. As Mike said, we've seen lower material costs several years, but at rates that have been unheard of around here prior to that.","The operating margins, the pull-through numbers we've seen even in this down period of sales, we've never experienced before in the past either. And I would give this group and the fact that our operating units are embracing that all of the credit because we're seeing our built-in quality numbers and our quality metrics measured by defects per unit also drop through the floor. So all of this is really helping us at a time when we need that kind of efficiency, and it's working well. And I think the best is yet to come when sales do pick up and we can put it to work in a growing environment. But certainly now it's helped us on our decrement pull-through, and quite happy about that.","Bradley M. Halverson - Chief Financial Officer & Group President","Doug, maybe I'll just make one comment. This is Brad. Frank Crespo leads that area and I'd go on visits with Frank. You would probably maybe not be surprised, but the tenor of these discussions when we go in with our suppliers is all about how we can collaborate, how we can develop a better product solution, more value to the customers and how can we take cost out of the process.","And so when we go in, I would say to our suppliers in today's environment maybe compared to seven, eight, nine years ago, the discussions are incredibly different. They're not about what kind of a price decrease can you give me and a discussion and the negotiation around that. The discussions are all around collaboration. And I would say that that group's done a great job in the last four, five years with improving the collaboration. And there's a lot of talented suppliers and they're a huge asset to us.","Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Thanks. Quick follow up?","Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, just on the pricing side. You folks got better pricing and resource this quarter. And, Doug, over the course of your leadership, you've delivered pretty well on the PIN (31:40) side. I'm wondering how much room do you have to deliver modest price increases even as material costs are flat to down. Do you think you have room there over the next couple of years because of how much the premium has come in versus the competitor set?","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I really don't see much change coming the next couple of years there, unless we see some inflationary pressure. The entire industry has more than enough capacity. We've got a strong dollar to contend with with many of our big key competitors. I'm quite happy with the fact we've been able to more or less beat, or meet anyway, retail CPI around the world in price realization the last few years.","The cost reduction at this point, at one point we talked about cost reduction efficiency, putting into market share, which we have been doing. I'd like to think we could continue that. Our market position over the last few years has trended up nicely and is even the last year up a bit in a very tough environment. I'd like to see that continue. So, I don't know, I think we continue to see more of the same where we've been in terms of price realization.","Jerry D. Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Thanks, Jerry.","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Hey, good morning. The conversation on the stock is going to increasingly shift toward the set-up into 2016. So I know you're not giving 2016 guidance, but can you help us a bit with where you see margins exiting 2015, in particular E&T? I mean, the margins have been stellar there, basically 18%, haven't really taken much of a hit. So I'm just curious, how do you see those margins as well as CI exiting 2015?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","David, this is Mike. Let me start with that. There are some headwinds in the second half of this year. And, again, I'm not going to get into next year, but I'll talk about a couple. One is inventory absorption impacts, negative. This year we're going to end up with a pretty healthy, by the time we get to the end of the year we think, a reasonably healthy inventory reduction for CAT inventory. And if you think about it, our sales this year versus last year are down from about $55 billion in our outlook down to about $49 billion. And so there's inventory coming out.","Now, without getting too far ahead and talking about next year, I'll just say if I look at what the analyst consensus is right now for next year \u2013 it's not our forecast, but collectively you guys have our sales about roughly flat with that next year. And if that were the case, the degree of inventory coming out, which is going to be pretty heavily weighted to the second half of this year, that would be less of a drag. So I think the second half of this year is going to have some negatives in it related to that.","Also there's a lot of first half\/second half differences, some that are seasonal. Just for example, we tend to build dealer inventory in the first half of the year as we're preparing for the summer selling season, particularly for construction. And then dealers tend to use inventory in the second half of the year and we tend to under-sell demand. And that will be the case we think again this year. We expect dealer inventories to come down.","So there are some built-in headwinds in the second half of the year. So I'm not going to get into a guidance game too much, but I don't think it's appropriate to probably take the second half of this year and multiply by two, I think because of headwinds like that.","Now, all that said, next year will definitely be set up as a bit of a mix problem for us. If you think about this year, particularly in the recent piece of oil and gas, we came into the year with a pretty decent backlog, so much of the sales decline that we're going to have for the year in oil and gas is going to be in the second half of the year. So and one way to think of it is, good first half or reasonable first half for recip oil and gas, lower second half. Unless something changes in the marketplace, I think the likelihood is that you'd have a couple of weak halves next year. I mean the backlog now, we're kind of through. So I think without \u2013 and I don't think that's likely a big secret, year-over-year, full year-over-year you'll be looking at probably some margin weakness because of that.","I think in terms of E&T margins overall, they've done a great job. I mean just if you look at the work that they've done over the past three, four years, it's just been phenomenal. I mean we focus a lot and we talk a lot when we have you on the phone about oil and gas, but they've taken up margins in almost every part of the business. Industrial for example, they've done a fabulous job on controlling costs and getting margins up there. So I think it's no doubt with recip oil and gas coming down there will be some pressure on E&T margins in the second half of the year. And unless the situation with Oil and Gas changes, I'm sure those pressures will continue. I know you would have probably liked a little more of a numerical discussion around 2016, but we'll have that maybe in October.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Well, I guess not even 2016 but, Mike, I was asking directly if you could at least quantify a little bit the margins exiting the year in E&T and CI. Are you willing to at least say you expect double-digit margins in both CI and E&T both 3Q and 4Q? We're just trying to get a feel for the run rate to set up into 2016.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Well, I mean certainly based on where E&T is right now, there's no doubt my mind they'll be certainly double digits over the course of the second half, and I believe that too for Construction.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Okay. And then lastly on the backlog. Obviously it's down 23% year-over-year. It's down 15% since the start of the year. How should we think of the backlog expectations the rest of the year, given they at least historically show some relationship to how you guide sales? Are we expecting the backlog to improve the rest of the year, or still a drawdown?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","I think it probably depends upon the business that we're in, because they all have some seasonality to them. For example in Construction, we tend to get a lot of orders in late in the year and very early in the year. We develop a bigger backlog. Kind of again, it's a little bit like dealer inventory. Dealers are preparing for getting equipment lined up for the selling season. So that will likely happen I would think again. So I mean without again getting too specific, I would suspect if the seasonal patterns hold that in the second half we'd probably build a little bit of backlog in construction.","In mining, the whole book-to-bill has been slightly negative. I mean it's getting to a point where there's not a lot of draw down coming, and I think we should probably be coming to the point where that's not very significant one way or the other. Until we get a recovery, that would be great. And then in E&T, you talked about the backlog coming down this year. And that goes back to the point that I made a little bit ago. We started the year with a pretty healthy backlog of recip engines for oil and gas and that's worked down throughout the year. There might be a little bit more of that to come out. But I can tell you, order rates for the first half of the year have been extremely lean. So I hope that helps.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Well I guess in aggregate then, is the CI uptick seasonally expected to be large enough to offset the E&T drawdown, I guess is the end of the day question.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Yeah, honestly I don't know what the backlog forecast is. That isn't something we cover. And if I did, I probably wouldn't. I mean we've never disclosed a forecast for that and I probably wouldn't start. But to be honest with you, I don't know. I would be surprised if the change \u2013 I would personally be surprised given everything I know if the change was very much one way or the other over the course of the second half.","David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","All right. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ted Grace. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","You said that the total revenue guidance is down a $1 billion to $49 billion and it's mostly FX. Is there any mix shift we should just be cognizant of between Construction, Resources and E&T and kind of the expectations for the year?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Yeah, I think what I would tell you is that probably a disproportionate share of the currency impact is construction. Mining tends to be in a lot of the world a pretty dollar-denominated business. Oil and gas kind of tends to be as well, not entirely. So it's not 100% is Construction, but it's probably disproportionately Construction. So earlier in the year, we had thought Construction would be down kind of 5% to 10%. It'll probably be closer to the top end of that. But outside of that, I think no big shifts in what we thought was going to happen.","I said this kind of in my opening comments. We've actually been I think pretty good at predicting what's going to happen this year, I think certainly on the top line and by and large on the bottom line as well.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Agreed. So I mean I think everyone's cognizant of how tough the macro is. One of the key kind of tenets of CAT's business model is market share. I was wondering if you could just talk about in the context of challenging markets, how you feel CAT's executing against the other competitors, and specifically maybe in North America construction if you're comfortable talking about that, EMEA construction and then whatever you might feel comfortable talking about within engines.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Yeah, I think generally I would say we've done pretty good on share. It's been a fairly consistent march up year after year for about I think the last four years. It's not always every product every quarter. But it's a good generic comment to make. We've done well over that time period in North America. We've got a couple things I would say are really helping us with share. We have excellent Tier 4 products. I mean, we are the fuel economy leader at Tier 4. We're promoting the heck out of that. Quality of the Tier 4 products has been very good. Customers like them. So that's helped us a lot and Tier 4 is, and the European equivalent is, essentially in those developed markets and that's very much a comment around North America. And we've done a pretty decent job. We've also as Doug mentioned earlier kept price increases pretty modest and that's helped. And we've been able to do that because we have taken a lot of cost out and we've essentially reinvested that in market share and have done I think a pretty decent job.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I just would like to add here on our Tier 4 final product, this is another big year for that. We're over halfway through final here and in Europe and in all of our models, we've seen an increase in fuel economy. We've seen a drop in defects per unit and those two things going into the marketplace have really helped us offset aggressive competitors, both because the dollar and because of capacity. I really am happy with where our product stands today. Particularly given our past history and some of these things we're going to introduce, a lot of new products at once, but we're in really good shape with this going forward, and I think the built-in quality, the lean metrics around what we measure now and the way in which we manage our factories and design are coming through nicely, and we see that. And that's been a big help to us in a tough cycle here.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Last thing I'll ask and I'll get back in queue. In terms of what you're seeing on the pricing front from a competitive dynamic, particularly North America, is it staying rational? Are you seeing any kind of shifts in that regard? And that'll be the last thing I ask.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","I don't have anything in particular that's dramatically different, no.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks. Best of luck this quarter, guys.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Okay. Ted, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Henry Kirn. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Henry George Kirn - SG Americas Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. It's SocGen.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Hey. Good morning, Henry. Welcome back.","Henry George Kirn - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thank you. It's good to be back. You mentioned in the press release accelerated focus on emerging technologies. Could you talk a little about the expectations for the level of investment required to maybe at a high level the required returns profile and the bigger picture goals there?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","What we're really referring to is the ongoing number of investments around connected machines to our factories, to our engineers, to our suppliers, to their owners and to their dealers. We've had a number of announcements around that. I expect to have a number more of those. The revolution is happening around big data and data analytics and we're right in the middle of it, with the idea being to connect every single one of our machines and hopefully those that aren't our machines and our customers with us in a very efficient way to raise their productivity. And I think you'll see continued emphasis on that. I would expect the returns actually on those to be very attractive as we go.","It's a process because we're starting from \u2013 not starting from scratch because we had a lot of that internally, but developing that externally, we're taking advantage of a lot of that investment that's occurred outside of our industry and is known there. So really optimistic about it, early days and I think we'll really change our customers' and our dealers' world over the next decade. So this is really the beginning of that basis.","Henry George Kirn - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thank you. And then now that the Greek situation is at least temporarily resolved, can you talk about what your folks on the ground there are seeing? And if there were green shoots, how would you expect that to begin to show up in the order book?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","I would say in Greece, we have such a small position there. It's such a small market. Even in the good days, it wouldn't ring any bells around here. I think the bigger issue with Greece is the amount of uncertainty it drives in EAME and beyond, that is specifically in South Europe. Having that tone down and calm down out of the headlines every single day may help. I think it depends on what the European Central Bank does and the individual governments going forward to have some kind of recovery in their economies. I would point out our retail numbers yesterday, while down in EAME, after the United States were the best.","It's still a down market, but we're not seeing total catastrophe there like we saw two, three, four years ago. I would say stability is probably in the not too distant future. I don't know when growth will return, but it will. So I think the Greece thing is one of those that needs to get behind us all in order to reestablish some kind of stability in the political environment over there, which will lead then to some kind of economic stability and hopefully growth in the not too distant future.","Henry George Kirn - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Okay. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. JPMorgan. My first question is just around the backlog being down 23% at this point. Mike, how feasible is it in any way, shape or form that revenues could be up next year?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","It all depends on what happens in the economy. In many of our businesses we don't commonly have much of a backlog. The entire aftermarket business, Construction is a pretty short lead-time business. So I think whether sales are up or not next year isn't necessarily driven by what's in the backlog today. It will be more a case of where are commodity prices as we start to exit the year, and that will be based on where's the global economy going. So I don't think right now I would draw a direct link between the backlog and the sales forecast. A lot could change in the next six months, good or bad. I'm not trying to sugarcoat it. I'm just saying that sales next year are going to be dependent a lot on what happens in the global economy.","We're on the edge right now of what's needed for growth. We have a pretty decent correlation, particularly in the U.S., when GDP is above 2.5%, we tend to grow. When it's about 2.5% or below, and it varies by degree, we don't. So I think a decent recovery in the economy would help a lot. I know that's a simplistic answer, but it's the truth.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, I mean, I think that's fair. And then my follow-up question would be, Doug, again with backlog being down 23%, I was a little surprised that R&D was flat year-over-year and SG&A only down 3%. What would it take for you to have to seriously look at those two line items and say, you know what, we're going to have to cut some of these projects that we're working on or some deeper cuts than just shutting manufacturing plants?","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Ann, we started the year in December, January hoping to actually increase our R&D 2015 over 2014. We have not done that. In fact, we took that back to flat, as you alluded to, as well as CapEx. We are constantly monitoring the market long term. You've heard me say many times in the past we have not had the availability when markets turn up and we lose market share. We're paranoid about market share around here. It's what drives us and drives our dealers.","I would say to see a major reduction, and I'm not going to define that, we'd have to see some kind of a cataclysm downwards in our top line. And we see that, we'll react as we have in the past and shown we can do that. So that would be the catalyst. If we see something really nasty coming or happening, we'd probably go right at. Not probably, we will go right after it.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And would you consider not repurchasing shares in the same environment, or is the share repurchase a done deal?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Well, the share repurchase that we talked about this morning, Ann, is what we expect to do for the third quarter. I mean, we've not really talked or placed any kind of forecasts or estimates or anything in the market around what we would do after that, but I certainly wouldn't describe the third quarter as a done deal per se, but it's absolutely what we intend to do.","Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What drives the buyback, it drives our capital allocation, everything else, is really a strong balance sheet. And with the balance sheet today at 33%, 34% debt-to-cap with almost $8 billion in cash, taking $1.5 billion off in the third quarter still leaves us in a great position going forward if we saw a cataclysm or if we don't. And that's really how we look at it because we absolutely have to have that strong balance sheet to get us through growth times and times we're not growing, like we have. We've never been positioned at a time like this with that strong of a balance sheet, which allows us to return some of that to shareholders.","Now, we go down in the top line further, we'll have to assess where we are with our capital structure and everything else and all that would play into it. We'd probably revise it to some degree. We've got plenty of room and plenty of years in our $10 billion authorization with $4 billion to go to get that done or not and we assess that all the time.","Bradley M. Halverson - Chief Financial Officer & Group President","Ann, this is Brad. I'll just make a comment. We're trying to act very consistent within our business model. You know, we've talked about going back to 2012 when our sales were down $16 billion, $17 billion. What we've wanted to do over this timeframe is to grow our market share, to improve our quality. We've had very little price action relative to that, so the quality of our earnings is to deliver 25% decremental to 30% decremental numbers balancing all of these things in terms of what we can do.","With the work we've been able to do in our variable margin, we're going to be right around 25% for that period. We're well below 25% to 30% decremental in the first half of the year. And so because of that, we're very happy to be able to fund our R&D programs and to be in a position of strength, to have those when the market does turns around. As Doug mentioned, we've got close to $8 billion of cash. Our debt-to-cap is low. We don't have huge CapEx needs at this point in time. And we're going to fund R&D at close to the levels of 2012 which was a record year. And we'll do all that and still have a very strong balance sheet heading into next year.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I appreciate that all in the backdrop of a global macro environment that's very hard to call right now.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, okay. I'll get back in line. Thank you. I appreciate your time.","Operator","Our next question is from Vishal Shah. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Deutsche Bank. Can you talk about your inventory levels? What do you think the right sized inventory levels would be and how does the reduction impact by different segments?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Now, Vishal, are you talking about our inventory or dealer inventory?","Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I would say your inventory levels. I think you said that you're going to reduce inventory levels in the back half of the year. What is the run rate you expect at the end of the year and where the reduction comes from?","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","Yes. So I think if you look at our business, we, a bit like dealers, sometimes tend to build some inventory at the beginning of the year as we're ramping up production for the selling season. And then when we get particularly in the fourth quarter, we have a tendency to sell more than we produce and inventory comes down. So I think a part of what you're going to see in the fourth quarter is just a little bit of a seasonal pattern for us. That happened last year as well. We had a pretty sizable inventory reduction in the second half.","I think if you just look at our inventory levels broadly, CAT inventory, we're working on lean. We'd like kind of year in and year out to take them down for efficiency. It would be nice if we had enough increase in volume that it caused inventory to go up from a volume standpoint, but all else being equal, we're working hard to improve inventory turns and be more efficient. So I guess all else being equal, I would like to see it continue to come down a little bit as we improve processes.","But, and I'll make a comment on dealer inventory too. It wasn't asked directly, but I think most of what we're seeing in over the course of this year first half, second half, it would be more reduction in the second half. But again, I think there is some seasonality in dealer inventory that way. It'll likely start to build again in the first quarter for the selling season. And I don't think dealer inventories overall are out of line or problematic or anything of the case like that. So I think reasonably speaking, most of the dealer inventory reduction that was because there was too much per se, happened in 2013 and 2014.","Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President, Finance Services Division","With that, we are at the top of the hour, and I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. We'll sign off and talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your phones line at this time.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions and comments following the presentation. Now I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Mike DeWalt","Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Strategic Services. And on the call today, I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.","Now this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. And if you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com Web site, and it'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","So this morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information and it certainly involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, which is Risk Factors, out of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2014, and also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release.","Now in addition to that, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can also be found in our release today and again it\u2019s posted on caterpillar.com in the Investors section.","Okay, let\u2019s get started this morning and I\u2019ll be covering three themes before we get into the Q&A. Second quarter sales and profit, the outlook for 2014 and our announcement this morning of additional share repurchase expected in the third quarter. Now before we really get into the quarterly numbers I thought it might be helpful to summarize the major themes from this morning\u2019s release. In other words what were the key points we\u2019re trying to get across. The first point is around stability and consistency. Back in October of 2013, we provided a preliminary outlook for 2014 sales and revenues and back then we said it looked to us like 2014 would be a relatively flat year with 2013. That was the case then and that\u2019s the case today. The midpoint of our outlook today is within about 1% of 2013\u2019s sales and revenues.","The second main theme this morning is around execution which has been good. Manufacturing, SG&A and R&D costs are close to 500 million, favorable in the first half versus the first half of 2013. Cash flows continue to be strong, we\u2019ve improved inventory turns, PINS continue to improve and we\u2019ve raised our profit outlook again this morning.","Now the third major theme this morning is cash deployment, and the actions we\u2019ve taken to help drive shareholder return. With the stock buyback we announced this morning, we expect that from the start of 2013 last year to the end of the third quarter of this year that we will have repurchased $6.2 billion worth of CAT stock and made two substantial increases in the quarterly dividend. So, that\u2019s three themes, consistency, execution and shareholder friendly cash deployment.","Okay now let\u2019s get into the second quarter results. Sales and revenues were 14.2 billion, and that was about 3% below the second quarter last year. Construction Industries was up 11%, Resource Industries down 29 and the rest, energy and transportation, financial products and our all other segment combined to be roughly flat with the second quarter of last year.","Now for construction, North America has been an area of strength and you might be surprised to hear so is our EAME region particularly Europe in the second quarter, it\u2019s been better as well. Now construction sales in the Latin America were about flat with the second last year but as we get into the third quarter, Latin America will likely turn a bit negative versus last year, and that\u2019s not driven by big economics, it\u2019s primarily related to large sales of Backhoe Loaders and Motor Graders now that we\u2019ve had to the Brazilian government. It was positive for sales last year and through the first half of this year but those orders are complete. So you should expect to see in the retail statistics of your release each month some decline there so don\u2019t be surprised if you see that we expect that it is included in our outlook.","Now construction sales in Asia Pacific were down slightly and that includes weaker sales in China. Now in China we started the year 2014 with the improving construction equipment demand but over the second quarter it weakened a bit. Our resource industries segment which again is mostly mining was down 29%. It was down 35% to 40% in every region of the world except North America. North America was much less negative than the other regions partly because the steep sales decline in North America started earlier, in other words it was probably closer to the bottom a year ago. In addition better sales to chlorine aggregate customers was also a factor that part of resource industries tends to be a little more closely aligned with construction and the particularly in North America that has been performing better, so again overall mining sales weak.","However, this was the first quarter since 2012 that resource industries sales were higher than the previous quarter. So that means second quarter of 2014 sales were about 6% higher than the first quarter. Sales improved from first to second for both new equipment and for parts. In fact for parts it is the second consecutive quarterly improvement. Q1 of 2014 was up slightly from Q4 of \u201913 and Q2 this year was a little better than Q1. Now it is too soon to suggest that the mining business is turning around but it\u2019s going to see sequential improvement.","Moving on to energy and transportation it has been incredibly stable high performing business over the past few years and this quarter was no exception. Overall sales for energy and transportation were stable with the second quarter of last year. And even if you take it down to the next level and you look at sales in the major industry served by energy and transportation that\u2019s oil and gas, PowerGen, transportation and industrial the sales were individually pretty flat with the exception of PowerGen and that was down sort of high single-digits but even there we see that being an issue around the timing of some large projects.","So in summary on second quarter sales and as you probably expected going into the quarter, construction sales were up nicely, mine sales were lower everything else was pretty much flat.","Okay I will shift from sales to profit in the second quarter. Headline numbers, profit per share of $1.69 excluding restructuring and $1.57 including restructuring costs. In comparison profit was $1.45 in the second quarter of 2013. Now by segment resource industries was the only segment that we had that declined versus the second quarter last year the rest were up. And a couple of big bright spots were a profit increase of more than 80% for construction industries and an all time record profit for energy and transportation and in fact their first quarterly profit over a $1 billion.","From a consolidated perspective we provide an operating profit comparison by region in our release and today that\u2019s on -- that is the graphic on Page 6 of our financial release because the individual buckets in that waterfall graph were relatively small I\u2019m not going to go into each of them in any detail. But I would summarize by saying that manufacturing cost and products utilization were modestly positive and the negatives were a bit lower sales volume, the restructuring costs in the quarter and absence of a sizable $135 million gain that we had in the second quarter last year related to a settlement with the owners of -- previous owners of our Siwei acquisition.","So that\u2019s the quarter, let\u2019s turn to the outlook for 2014 where we\u2019ve made a modest change to sales and revenues and increased our outlook for profit. With sales half of the year is behind us and we have tightened up the range and lowered the midpoint slightly. Now as I mentioned at the outset of the call this morning our view of 2014 sales and revenues has remained reasonably constant, in another words a flattish year versus 2013. We thought that was the case last year we think that\u2019s still the case today.","That said with half of the year over we have tighten the range and we have -- the updated range is a forecast of 54 billion to 56 billion in sales and revenues and for reference to previous range was 56 billion plus or minus 5% that meant a range of just over 53 billion to just under 59 billion. The middle of the new range is 55 billion and that is slightly lower than the previous midpoint of 56 billion and most of that change is in construction industries and reflects the weaker sales expectations in China based on the reporting out of China that probably shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise and decline in expectations in the CIS and in the Africa, Middle East region and given the political turmoil in those parts of the world that\u2019s probably not a big surprise.","In terms of profit, for a better understanding of results, we are providing outlook, again both with and without restructuring costs. Today, we have increased the outlook for both. Now excluding restructuring costs, we have increased it to $6.20 a share, that\u2019s a $0.10 increase from the prior forecast. Now our expectation for restructuring costs is near the bottom end of our 400 million to 500 million range. And with restructuring cost all in, our updated outlook is profit per share of 5.75 which is $0.20 per share, better than the previous outlook.","Now to help you think about the rest of the year, the third and the fourth quarter, there\u2019s one more thing I would like to cover and that\u2019s how we are thinking about the last two quarters. There is typically seasonality in our sales and we think that\u2019s going to be the case this year as well. So we have got half of the year behind us and you know the midpoint of our outlook. We basically have the second half of the year, not a lot different than the first half.","Now we expect sales and revenues in the third quarter to be similar to the first quarter of 2014, and fourth-quarter sales to be more in line with the second quarter of 2014. In terms of profit per share, with lower sales in the third quarter, it would likely be the weakest profit quarter of the year and with higher sales in the fourth quarter, profit per share should be similar to the average of the first and second quarters of 2014. I hope that helps you think about our expectations and how the third and fourth quarter could play out. And if you missed writing that down, again we will be reposting the transcript of this call on our caterpillar.com Web site.","Now in addition to our financial results this morning we announced that we expect to purchase or repurchase another $2.5 billion of caterpillar stock in the third quarter. This repurchase is a part of the 10 billion that the Board authorized earlier this year. Now the context behind our repurchases really over the past two years is consistent with our cash deployment priorities. Coming out of the 2008 and 2009 great recession, we had work to do to improve the strength of the balance sheet. We needed to invest for growth, and with very low interest rates our employee benefit plans needed additional funding.","Over the past few years we have made significant progress. Our machinery engines and transportations at the capital ratio is at the low-end of our target range. Benefit plan funding is in good shape. And we generally have the production capacity in place that we think we will need for the next few years. And although we will continue to be opportunistic, we aren\u2019t expecting any large acquisitions. So with nearly 9 billion of machinery engines and transportation operating cash flow last year in 2013 and nearly 4 billion in the first half of this year, and with significant cash on hand we have had the opportunity to take substantial actions to improve shareholder return.","In 2013 we repurchased $2 billion worth of stock and raised the dividend by 15%. In June of 2014 we increased the dividend again an additional 17%, and by the end of the third quarter of this year we expect to have repurchased about 4.2 billion of stock in 2014. That\u2019s a 1.7 billion in the first quarter, and the 2.5 billion in the third quarter. Rewarding stockholders is an important goal and our actions demonstrate our commitment. So, in summary we had a pretty good second quarter. We raised the profit outlook for 2014 and we announced another $2.5 billion of stock repurchase.","So with that we\u2019re ready to shift over to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Okay. We we\u2019ll take our first question from Andrew Kaplowitz, please announce your affiliation.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","I'm from Barclays. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Mike DeWalt","Hey Andy good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","","So Mike, you said in the release that dealer inventories declined about $500 million in the quarter and you also talked in the release about the decline in inventories this year now being more than you previously expected mostly driven by Resource Industries. How much did this contribute to the reduction of your sales forecast and what kind of visibility do you have to a bottoming and destocking really across the Company, but particularly in Resource Industries?","Mike DeWalt","Good question Andy, dealer inventory, certainly a benefactor versus our original outlook when we started the year. It kind of looks now like dealer inventory is going to be down maybe $1 billion or so more than we thought. In fact the first quarter and the second quarter combined, we are still a slightly for the year. We had a 700 increase in the first quarter, 500 increased the second quarter, and a lot of that is seasonality. But in the second half we\u2019re looking for about 800 million of decline per quarter, so about a 1.6 billion coming out in the second half, so. Now that\u2019s having an impact on second quarter, I\u2019m sorry second half results. And it\u2019s a couple of things you know, one, we\u2019ve not really had a turnaround in mining yet, and so dealers are continuing to satisfy some demand out of inventory. We thought it was going to be a lot less, coming into the year and things might start picking up, we really haven\u2019t seen that yet. So that\u2019s one factor, and I think on construction, you know dealer inventory we\u2019re going to end the year probably a little bit lower than we thought. And that\u2019s actually despite a pretty darn good year so far for construction.","I think it\u2019s a case where we talk a lot about execution, we\u2019ve actually been able to take down our lane one channel inventory that we have and dealers have been able to take their inventory down as well, I think we\u2019re -- when you think about what\u2019s an adequate supply kind of going back to your question, you know it\u2019s within a range and I think particularly for construction it\u2019s getting down to you know a pretty good level. So you know if demand doesn\u2019t decline then you\u2019d have to think going forward the dealer inventory\u2019s going to be in even better shape at the end of this year than it was last year. So in summarize your question, I know I was kind of long winded. Dealer inventories having a bit more of an impact this year in on it, it\u2019s a principle reason why the second half sales aren\u2019t going to be better than what is in our forecast.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","","Okay, Mike, that's helpful. And then maybe just shifting gears, you talked about the timing of large projects negatively impacting your E&T retail sales, but really your outlook for E&T really hasn't changed. Can you talk about your visibility in this segment? Do you still feel good about it because backlog is up and maybe specifically about power generation, what you see there?","Mike DeWalt","","Yes, I\u2019d say E&T overall, I\u2019d say we feel very good, second half looks like it\u2019s going to be pretty strong. We\u2019ve had, I would say very good order rates over the last quarter particularly for oil and gas, for large engine products in general but oil and gas has been particularly good, so that\u2019s contributed to the increase in the back log there. With electric power, we kind of have a couple of different businesses. We have -- we break it down between the investor business which is essentially large scale installations that, small we call it retail gen sets. The big gen set business, the big end has been pretty good and that\u2019s the piece of it that can tend to be lumpy around big projects. We had some last year we\u2019ll have some this year. And the timing affects how that plays out, certainly by month and by quarter and you see that in the retail statistics, it\u2019ll move around quite a bit. I\u2019ll tell you we feel pretty good about energy and transportation overall, really most of the sectors within there and particularly the oil and gas.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","","Okay, we\u2019ll take the next question from Robert Wertheimer, please state your affiliation.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","","Hi, it's Vertical Research Partners and good morning, everybody. Mike, you mentioned the oil and gas strengthened. I know fracing has been ticking up and some of your channel partners have been bullish on that and the pipeline and a bunch of other stuff. If I am not mistaken, you have a Tier 4 changeover in some of the oil and gas engines for next year. Could you talk generally about the higher horsepower Tier 4, how many engines you have running, how confident you feel whether there is any kind of pre-buy going on there?","Mike DeWalt","","I\u2019m going to have to defer that question Rob. I\u2019m not an expert on that. I don\u2019t know the number.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","","Okay. No, that's fine, that's fine. I will follow-up after. I should have sent it before. And then I guess the second question, you just kind of addressed at length, so I apologize for going back to it, but the dealer inventory, which you gave good disclosure on, but are you comfortable that the Construction, which has been very strong and you are gaining share in an up markets, so it is really hard to sort out, but are you comfortable that Construction inventory hasn't restocked a little bit too much? Can you tell that -- especially in LatAm where some of the markets look really soft, you mentioned the big government project, so I'm just curious if you think the Construction inventory overinflated at all in the first half? Your margins were quite good in the first half and you are signaling down. So that is my second question.","Mike DeWalt","","No, I think the first and second quarters played out pretty close to what we thought, if you think about it, the first quarter for sales to end users is always one of the lowest quarters of the year. Dealers commonly stock up and then sell it down in the second quarter which they did this year, it came down. And then the third quarter is usually pretty weak as well, a lot of Europe is on vacation, a lot of other parts of the world take vacation time and we feel that in our business, so certainly a bit more of that\u2019ll come out in the third quarter and then again more probably in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s always tough to forecast this with massive accuracy I mean we look at what are reasonable months of sales are but that varies by region and it\u2019s a reasonable range and I think construction based on where we are in terms of the timing of the year lesser expectations are for year-end, is definitely within that reasonable range.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","","Thank you. And then are you able to say what the total mining dealer de-stock is this year? You have kind of said it, but I just want to make sure I back into it right.","Mike DeWalt","","I think it\u2019s going to end up being about 1 billion of memory serves me, I\u2019m not a 100% sure on that but I think that\u2019s over magnitude.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","","Thanks Mike.","Mike DeWalt","","Which is more than we thought coming into the year.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Okay. And we\u2019ll take our next from Jamie Cook, please state your affiliation.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse"," ","Hi, good morning, Credit Suisse. I guess a couple questions around the mining or the Resource business. The sales were up sequentially, which was nice. The margins were down sequentially. I get the year-over-year issues, but I guess the margins in Resource disappointed a little relative to my expectations. In particular, when you said aftermarket was up again. So can you just talk about that? Is that just investment that you incurred this year that you held off on last year? And then I think last quarter you said in terms of resource margins you expected them to be about flat with the first quarter. Is that still the way to think about it? And then my second question, again, sorry, a follow-up on just the Resource business. You said I think OE and aftermarket was up. Can you give a little color around what markets, both on OE and aftermarket, just a little more color on that commentary you mentioned in the prepared remarks?","Brad Halverson","","Yes this is Brad Halverson. Just one comment on our resource industries segment in terms of its margins, this segment is critically important to us and we\u2019ve made a conscious effort to continue to invest in the technology and autonomous mining and those types of things as well as our initiatives around Bucyrus. And so I would say that we have made a conscious decision relative to maybe our normal expectations on pull through to continue to invest in the segment even where their sales are at.","Mike DeWalt","","And Jamie their incrementals I think too were really operationally better than the numbers look like just right after face of the statement. Last year they had a $135 million gain from the Siwei settlement so if you take that, if you adjust for that operationally they were pretty good.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","","No, I get that. But is there any way you can tell us like what the investment number this year relative to sort of what you are thinking about last year and then again how to think about margins for the full year?","Mike DeWalt","","Yes we\u2019re at a point now where margins are low enough and sales are low enough the percentages I think the dollars are probably in some ways a little more important and easier way to think about it. We were $140 million something in the first quarter 130 million something in the second quarter and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see material changes from that probably for the rest for the year.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","","Okay, sorry, and then just any additional color on the commentary with the aftermarket being up again in the second quarter? Was that a sequential uptick from Q1 and then just color on where you are seeing it and on the OE side as well?","Mike DeWalt","","Yes actually from first to second in fact what I looked at last night was sort of a less about regions and more about products, it was actually I mean small numbers I\u2019m going to start with that small numbers but fairly widespread on the OE. And the part sales we have strength in part sales on things like underground coal trucks traditional CAT were actually a little better than most where we\u2019re seeing down side on the aftermarket now and things like deferred maintenance on big shovels and the drag lines and alike but I\u2019d say that and the numbers aren\u2019t huge even the increase quarter-over-quarter was actually relatively small, but thankfully turned in the right direction.","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thanks I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","","Okay. We\u2019ll take our next question from Nicole DeBlase. Please announce your affiliation.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","","Yes, Morgan Stanley. Good morning guys.","Mike DeWalt","","Good morning.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","So I just wanted to address the locomotive business a little bit. Your biggest competitor there saw pretty strong equipment order growth this quarter, I think like 40%. So I am just curious how locomotive orders are trending for Cat? Are you guys seeing the positive impact associated with the Tier 4 pre-buy at all yet?","Mike DeWalt","","Yes, yes so this is a big year for locomotive sale probably the biggest since we\u2019ve owned EMD. There have been a lot of misconceptions about this and this is a good opportunity I think to clear some of those up EMD has been great acquisition on our part, their market share has gone up in North American locomotives quite a bit since we brought them. Their sales have gone up quite a bit and I would use the words pre-buy but certainly dealers have ordered a lot of locomotives from us as well as our competitors for delivery this year\u2026","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. Do you think we'll start seeing the sales pick up in like 3Q or is it mostly a 4Q event?","Mike DeWalt","Production has been going pretty solid all year long effectively we\u2019re book solid. If we could have built more we probably could have sold a little bit more this year. But we are book solid on locomotives. The timing of the sales is around when we deliver them. And we will probably have a better both third quarter and fourth-quarter. Now on the whole Tier 4 question, we\u2019re close to our customers. There are not that many North America. They\u2019re largely the big class I rail. We have very close relationship with essentially all of them. We have been talking to them about Tier 4 expectations for a long time. They have been telling us they don\u2019t expect to order much for the next couple of years. We have talked to them about our Tier 4 plans. No surprise to them. Our view is that the marketplace expectations over the next -- that the industry North America over the next couple of years is going to be down a lot from where we are right now. And the impact of the timing of our Tier 4 product is not going to have a great material impact on our sales at all.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Okay, that was really helpful. ","Doug Oberhelman","I will just add to it. It\u2019s Doug Oberhelman here. The EMD acquisition in general, as Mike said, we are really happy with that business. Since we have owned tails of more than double, this is a big year, big pre-buy year for sure. We would expect and have an talking to our customers a post-buy anemia in \u201915 and \u201916. Based on that we modified the Tier 4 development program that was in place and we acquired EMD because we didn't really -- like what we saw in terms of the end product with that engine. In doing that we contemplated that there will be virtually no or little demand in \u201915 and \u201916 in North America. That\u2019s why we\u2019re ramped up this year. That\u2019s why we delayed our Tier 4 program and we will have a really good offering late \u201915 and \u201916 in Tier 4, and not to mention, our natural gas program for locomotives is already in place and some of those will be available in fact aren't running today. So we think we really got a good program going. Our market share has gone up significantly as Mike said, in North America and outside North America sales have been fairly active as well. So we\u2019re really pleased with EMD acquisition, more for better ones.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks. And then my second question is on E&T margin. So the segment margins there were really good, reaching a new high this quarter. Was there anything special to call out that drove the 19.5% or do you think that that level of strength could continue into the second half?","Mike DeWalt","I won\u2019t make any comments on their margin in the second half, as we don\u2019t really do guidance by segment, but they have been doing just fabulous job of executing on sales that were actually down a couple of percentage points. They managed cost down and improved the margins. They\u2019ve been very stable. Whether or not it\u2019s going to be exactly the same for this quarter, you know that depends a lot on production, mix of products, regions they\u2019re sold, I mean you can always expect some bit of up and down in the margin rate. But I think overall they\u2019ve just done a great job. Not just this year, but really over the past three years. Their sales have been stable and profits have been going up.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks. I will pass it on.","Operator","","We\u2019ll take our next question from Timothy Thein. Please announce your affiliation.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup","Great, Citigroup. Thanks, good morning. Yes, Mike, just coming back to the comments on oil and gas and specifically within well servicing in North America, I'm curious as the capacity is starting to come back, how do you feel about your relative position in that market in terms of now having the full offering in terms of pumps, transmissions and engines? And kind of related to that, are you seeing any -- just given how quickly demand has come back after being dead for 18 months or so -- are you seeing or experiencing any particular kind of product delays or extended backlogs for your products?","Mike DeWalt","Well, you know this is not a business so much, Tim, that orders today and expects it tomorrow. So we are increasing production of large engines. We are taking up the build rates in Lafayette because of the increasing demand, and back to your original point. We\u2019ve been a leader in this kind of business for a long time and I think the additional transmissions and now the pressure pumps with our JV strengthened that. I think it\u2019s a great business. It lines up well with kind of the strength of Caterpillar, durability, reliability, service, dealer network, parts supply, it is a great thing. You\u2019re right, because if you go back a couple of years ago, what words to say, there was plenty of equipment in the market and it slowed down pretty dramatically from there. Last year was quiet a down year for our servicing. But I think they\u2019ve gone through maybe the excess inventory they\u2019ve had that plus a little bit lower supplies of, proper supply of gas supporting prices it looks like, it looks in good orders on our standpoint, it looks like it\u2019s going to be a pretty good business.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup","","Okay, thanks. And then just switching back over to -- you touched earlier on the parts sales and mining. And I saw one of the majors the other day, actually the largest miner, who they are guiding to production growth across some of their key industrial commodities of 4% to 10% in their fiscal FY15. And I recognize the industry is doing a lot more now to kind of sweat their assets, but just going back to what is embedded in your guidance, obviously, you've taken the forecast down a bit on mining. But how long I guess do you expect before we start to see more of a re-coupling between your parts sales versus underlying production?","Mike DeWalt","","That is the $64,000 question, baffling is probably the wrong word, but generally mine production has been pretty good, but equipment sales have been very poor. They probably had a little more equipment that they needed it\u2019s a little bit almost like the tracking situation. So it will come back, there is no doubt about, they\u2019re selling or they\u2019re buying right now at levels that are far below what a normal sustainable replacement level would be but again the question is on little bit like fracing and well servicing, when will that turnaround. ","It\u2019s hopeful to think that with part sale starting to add job a bit the equipment sales not going down anymore that where add an inflection, but both the mining customers and our sales have proven that it\u2019s in the industry that\u2019s extremely tough to forecast, so the honest answer is it needs to go well, it will go well just the timing of when that\u2019s going to happen that we don\u2019t know.","Brad Halverson","","Just a little more color on Michael. There is no question that there was an artificial boom of until 2011-12 in the world, the bust since then is equally I would of the same magnitude if not worse. We are see our customers delayed maintenance defer maintenance, do you think they have not done in the past. So at some point and as Mike said we don\u2019t when this will come to us even if its replacement part cycle which we haven\u2019t see yet.","Now I can fully believe as do our customers that the bottom is just behind us are our numbers are just almost miniscule in terms of taking up, but they are taking up and I think anecdotally with our customers they see that too, when they start to get back into a normal parts replacement cycle and even a normal replacement cycle is a number a lot of that will depend on they\u2019re running and I saw that announcement as well with a big one or two I met with lot of in the last couple months and I know they were talk about taking production down but most of them just trying look again more of the same. So the bottom-line we don\u2019t always going to come back but it will come back and I just see replacement product cycle first in some magnitude.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup","","Thanks.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll take our next question Larry De Maria. Please state your affiliation.","Larry De Maria - William Blair ","","Thanks, Larry De Maria, William Blair. Just stick with EMD for one minute. I think you mentioned that you have an offering late 2015 or 2016 for Tier 4. Is that ahead of schedule for the 2017 launch and how successful are we now in building an international book to offset the declines you mentioned domestically?","Mike DeWalt","","Couple of things, our view is that what we should have a Tier 4 diesel offering for 2017. We have actually a big after market rail business a big service rail business and we sale locomotives and components internationally and we\u2019re increasing our passions in rail business as well. So there is a lot of aspects to this and I think with the big push in North America that we\u2019ve had this year that\u2019s a big demand from customers. One of the things that we done our best to do, is to differ as much of the non North American demand as we can in the next year, I\u2019m not going to maybe give a forecast for next year just little early for that we\u2019ll talk about 2015 maybe a little bit more next time we get together for these calls in October. But we have actively tried to focus as much as we possibly could more in North America this year because of the big demand.","Larry De Maria - William Blair","Okay, thanks. And then moving over a little bit, I know the business plan obviously calls to increase field population and you got some pricing in Construction, but in strong markets like North America, are we any closer to pushing through bigger price increases or are we still concerned with decreasing PIN at this point? I know it is having some obviously reverberations in the industry, and maybe you are under-earning a little bit compared to potential, but you are improving your market position, so just curious if we are any closer to getting more outsized price gains.","Mike DeWalt","","I think our strategy over the last few years and we\u2019ve been just pounding through this quarter-after-quarter, just to have very modest pricing, good cost reduction, improve quality, improve delivery performance and get market share and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. Through that period we\u2019ve had a very stable pricing environment, not much up, not much down and I don\u2019t see that changing in the near future. ","Larry De Maria - William Blair","","Okay, thanks.","Operator","","Okay, we\u2019ll take our next question from Theoni Pilarinos, please state your affiliation.","Theoni Pilarinos - Raymond James","","Hi, Raymond James. You made it clear at your Investor Day that it was a priority for you to take some of the cyclicality out of your business and make your cost structure more flexible. Just looking at the mining segment and talking about when it returns -- eventually it will return and when it does how do we balance the uptick in demand that we've see in previous cycles and the backlog that we get to with some of the restructuring and layoff costs that you are taking now? Do you think that you are going to be caught as you have in the past with not enough capacity to meet demand?","Mike DeWalt","","Well, we put in capacity, physical capacity in the last cycle and I think we have adequate capacity in mining, even for a sizeable upturn when it comes. What we\u2019ve tried to do with our cost structure as you say make it more flexible and that means being able to take out costs when volume goes down and add cost when volume comes back in other words, try to make more of the cost structure as variable as we can. And we\u2019ve done that, you know over the past two years in mining we\u2019ve taken a lot of cost out, we\u2019ve taken fixed cost out, or weak off period cost out in our major manufacturing facility, but we\u2019ve done that without materially impacting capacity. So when things turn up there\u2019s no doubt we\u2019ll need to hire more people to get the work done.","But I\u2019ll just give you an example of the kinds of things that we\u2019ve done to make that happen. You know we increased capacity quite a bit for large trucks over the course of 2010, \u201911 and \u201912. But we essentially did that in our Decatur facility, I mean we didn\u2019t have any square footage to do that, it was all about how we laid out the factory, the equipment the processes to get more production out of that facility. So, you know other than depreciation we didn\u2019t add a lot of fixed cost to get extra capacity, so that\u2019s just an example of the kinds of things that we\u2019ve done. I hope we do get a big turnaround that causes us to need more people I mean that\u2019d be good for us, that\u2019d be good for the industry, that\u2019d be good for the country.","Doug Oberhelman","","Let me just add a little bit more to that, looking back at \u201912 we did 65 billion in volume at that time, this will apply to both construction, mining as well as E&T -- energy and transportation for that matter. We\u2019ve been working hard even though on lean manufacturing which is adding capacity every day in a very lean way as we go forward that will come home to help us as well, so, you\u2019ve seen our CapEx numbers come down the last two or three years, we invested early during this cycle to take advantage of that which we did, we built market share, so our CapEx needs are pretty well met, we think organically in the next few years at least early through the next upturn, so we\u2019re in pretty good shape with all of that, I don\u2019t expect to miss a sale to tell you the truth, on the way up when the business returns in mining and I\u2019d go so far to say expect the same thing in construction. Because the lean activities we\u2019re doing here to help us with lead times, shorten lead times and better availability. ","Theoni Pilarinos - Raymond James","","Okay, great. Thank you. And my second question has to do with your recovery. You have kind of described as slow and steady so far this year in the US. We've seen a couple of months now of non-res pickup and this has typically been the key turning point for you in addition to the highway bill. How do things sit now that we have had a month or two of non-res pickup, how does that change anything from the slow and steady recovery we've seen, if at all?","Mike DeWalt","","Well it\u2019s been slow and steady overall, actually North America in construction has been you know pretty good this year, I would describe North America as a little better than slow and steady. And although we didn\u2019t change it a lot you know as a part of the updated outlook, you know the principal change was down for construction as I said before a little, China and then the turmoil in the Middle East and the CIS causing caution. But in the midst of all that we actually edged US construction up a little bit and I think defines there are encouraging.","And to put it in some context though, Theoni, we've had a few years of improvement in North American construction. This has been actually a pretty decent year. But even through all of that, we are still thinking this year is kind of unit basis, we are still thinking this year is going to be sort of 15% to 20% below the \u201906 peak. So there is still a lot of room I think to run in construction in North America. We just need some sustaining decent economic growth North America. We need the highway bill to get sorted out. We need economic activity -- housing starts a well below what the long-term needs to be the support population growth, and some point little bit like mining. That stuff is going to come back, and when it does it will be part of it. And it\u2019s starting too, now. ","Theoni Pilarinos - Raymond James","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Mike.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ross Gilardi. Please state your affiliation.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Bank of America. Thank you. Mike, with respect to E&T and margins, shouldn't mix work strongly in your favor in the second half versus the first half given the pickup in oil and gas orders that you mentioned, which at least the turbine business I think is your highest margin business. You've got the sharp pickup in locomotive orders as well, which is still in front of you for the rest of the year or at least the locomotive deliveries, excuse me, coupled with a weaker PowerGen market. So I would think margins would be -- the mix would definitely be a benefit in the second half of the year.","Mike DeWalt","The stuff that you have said was true, or much of it was, but it doesn\u2019t act necessarily that all come to the conclusion that you've drawn. Oil and gas should be, we think good in the second half, but I think most of the areas of the energy and transportation business we think are going to improve in the second half. So it\u2019s not all going to be concentrated in oil and gas. I don\u2019t see a big impact on mix in the second half. We do have a couple of big orders going out, or of one big sale that we are expecting that will probably be a little below the average that will temper -- or be certainly less than the average margin rate, that will temper E&T expectations I think a bit in that, later in the year. And E&T is in some way similar to a lot of the rest of the business. And we have a higher discretionary cost in the second half of the year than we do in the first half of the year. Some engineering programs are likely going to ramp up there a little bit too. I wouldn\u2019t get carried away on -- margins this quarter were quite good. I wouldn\u2019t get carried away at all thinking that you\u2019re going to get a lot better in the second half of E&T. We had a great second quarter there.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then you talked about pricing as the principal driver of the margin expansion year on year in E&T. Can you flesh out a little bit more what is happening there and is it sustainable?","Mike DeWalt","Say that again?","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America","Yes, in your press release, you attributed the year-on-year operating profit improvement for E&T to pricing and I was wondering what's happening there, any particular businesses where you are seeing more pricing power and is it sustainable?","Mike DeWalt","So here is the thing. When the numbers are relatively small in terms of change -- operating profit, if memory serves me up, it was up a little over a 50 million. It wasn\u2019t a lot. When you have small changes in operating profit like that and we are describing the reasons, sometimes it makes it seem as though it's maybe more important than it was. The changes that we had in pricing for Energy and Transportation certainly weren\u2019t outsized. Again, it is like -- for the total Company, if you look at the waterfall chart, all of the buckets are relatively small. So describing anything that\u2019s inside them can make them seem a little more important there are. I don\u2019t think, there is not a big price increase going on there. I don\u2019t see any big change in pricing activity going forward.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America ","Okay, thanks. And just a last one real quick, Russia and CIS, I mean how big is it and what are you seeing with the sanctions?","Mike DeWalt","Yes, it\u2019s not a huge. The CIS is not huge for us. We don\u2019t do sales by country. It\u2019s as you would expect a lot less than in someplace like China, the industry there is just not as big. But it has come off. Even though it\u2019s not big, it\u2019s come off a lot. And that\u2019s what makes it worth mentioning. ","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America ","Okay. Alright, thanks very much.","","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jerry Revich. Please state your affiliation.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","","Hi good morning, it\u2019s Goldman Sachs. ","Mike DeWalt","","Good morning Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Mike, at the Analyst Day, we spent some time talking about the focus on supplier development and just improving the connectivity. I'm wondering if you could just give us an update on how those efforts are tracking, if you can share supplier on-time deliveries or other metrics that are willing to talk about just to give us a sense for progress?","Mike DeWalt","","Jerry, that\u2019s a great question. But as all the things I tried prepare for this call that wasn\u2019t one of them I\u2019d happy to ask the purchasing guys of the Chairmen group that question but I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have a good answer for you. How about a second question?","Brad Halverson","","Jerry maybe I just kind of quickly in general terms I can get the numbers back in terms of percent but I would say our global purchasing group under the Dave Bozeman, combining that with our lean initiative focused on built in quality right time and then more importantly perhaps the customer lead times. The collaboration with our supplier is outstanding right now and we are seeing good progress connected to our lean initiatives across the board. So I would say relative to our engagement with suppliers in collaboration and you kind of seeing that taking our material cost results over the last year and half is often very positive.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And my second question, just on the restructuring costs, it sounds like the timing is moving around a bit. Can you just give us a sense for what kind of cost savings you will be delivering by the fourth quarter on a run rate basis and what kind of tailwind we should look for next year? And then separately, Mike, I guess in the past when sales have stabilized at low levels in places like resources, you have been able to deliver improved profitability and margins even at flat sales once you stopped cutting production and I am wondering if that is a possibility as we think about 2015 if you are willing to address that.","Brad Halverson","","I will let Mike handle, this is Brad again handle 15 and the back half but I would say the restructuring has just moved a little bit will have some of that cost move in the 2015 I would say probably roughly around the midpoint 450 is still a good number in total but some of that will over 15 and I would say the benefit by a large consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about before but it\u2019s not the only thing we\u2019re doing around cost restructuring across management I would say.","We talk a little bit about what we\u2019ve done in terms of last kind of conference. We\u2019re embracing the fact that we do have some cyclicality but I think the thing to remember is the fact that we have a lot diversity and really have one segment right now that\u2019s not performing and it\u2019s in the bottom of their cycle but we have a strong energy in transportation business and construction business strong in North America little concern in developing world with the margins that improve significantly. So I would say from an execution standpoint how we are managing these businesses and where we\u2019re spending our money the good cost reduction last year, we had 500 million roughly in the first half of this year and it\u2019s kind of part of how we\u2019re operating there. So I feel pretty good about the fact that we have good consistent execution.","Doug Oberhelman","","You didn\u2019t ask this, but I just wanted to time in one more thing that I thought Mike come up but he hasn\u2019t, if you look at the second half of the year and the first half of the year we got a headwind in the second half of the year it was a small headwind, it was the small tailwind in the first half for the year it\u2019s going to be pretty neutral inventory absorption. We\u2019ve had not dealer in inventory, we had a small increase in the first half and we expect that come down in the second half and finish the year a little bit, basically fairly neutral, But what that has meant is that has been a little positive in the first half of the year and it will be a little negative in the second half of the year, and that\u2019s also one of the reasons why you\u2019re seeing a little difference in first half and second half profit.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Mike DeWalt","","I think we have time for one more.","Operator","","Okay. We\u2019ll take the next question from David Raso. Please state your affiliation.","David Raso - ISI Group","","ISI. Can I clarify the dealer inventory comments? Sequentially, did you say down $800 million each of the next two quarters?","Mike DeWalt","","Yes we did.","David Raso - ISI Group","And that includes engines and machines or just machines?","Mike DeWalt","","That\u2019s machines I don\u2019t think engines is forecast to change much. Dealer inventory in engines is smaller than much more stable what I was talking about was machines.","David Raso - ISI Group","So just to be clear then, the second half of the year, on a year-over-year basis, production then is going to be largely in line with retail?","Mike DeWalt","","Say that again David.","David Raso - ISI Group","The year-over-year -- the first half of the year, you have had some nice help from the dealer swings in inventory.","Mike DeWalt","","I mean overall it wasn\u2019t much we went up 700 first quarter down 500 second quarter, so first half was 200 million ","David Raso - ISI Group","Well, I'm thinking year over year, Mike. The first half of the year, you had about $1.8 billion. It was about $1.8 billion help, right, just the year-over-year changes. The second half of the year, just so I am clear, it looks like the year-over-year change will be pretty much neutral because last year third quarter, inventory went down $800 million. Last year fourth quarter, inventory went down $700 million sequentially, right, so the year over year is a bit of a push.","Mike DeWalt","","Yes.","David Raso - ISI Group","So that said, if production is going to be basically in line with retail year over year, it implies the dealer stats, the retail stats. You must be looking at something from the dealers that are telling you that the retail data is going to get also pretty close to flat year over year because that is how you are forecasting your own sales for the second half. I know the dealer stats don't include pricing, don't include parts, but I just want to make sure I am reading that right as I see the dealer stats come out. There must be some implication here that the dealer stats do get close to flat over the course of the second half of the year. Is that fair?","Mike DeWalt","","Yes. I think we would see it trending move towards that as the year goes on. I think that\u2019s a very reasonable assumption.","David Raso - ISI Group","Okay. And then last one, the sequential from mining revenue?","Mike DeWalt","David, I will just go on from that. Throughout much of last year the mining numbers were continuing to go down. And so what a lot of that will be is -- we will be lapping what was actually quite low Resource Industries. That is probably where you will see a lot of improvement. You\u2019ve already started to see that. This last month on Resource Industries, it was less negative than prior months, by reasonable margin.","David Raso - ISI Group","Well, to that point, obviously, people watch the monthly retails and the fact is, if you look at the last three months for machines, it was still down 10, engines was also down 10. The way the guide plays out, obviously you must be looking at something from the dealers that tell you we are going to get pretty close to flat year over year in the second half. And I don't mean just one month, I mean basically for the first half and the second half, right? That is how you get to your own sales. So that moment retail turns positive, I mean obviously the stock is going to respond to that. So I am just trying to figure out am I reading that properly, that there is something you are seeing from your dealers that is telling you, you are going to have a machine number, I don't care if it is Resource, Construction, but combined those numbers are going close to flat soon as well as an engines or you couldn't have a flat Cat sales in the second half because there is no longer that big production retail gap.","Mike DeWalt","I am not going to give you an exact kind of number because as you started up, parts and service matters, pricing matters, currency impact matter a bit. But I think your underlying premise is that the retail stat should relative to a year ago start looking better is absolutely true. ","David Raso - ISI Group","Alright. Now that we are past 12 Eastern, I will cut it off. I'll ask you my second question off-line. But thank you very much. I appreciate it.","","Mike DeWalt","Okay, with that we\u2019re a couple minutes over, we will wrap it up. Thank you very much everyone and we will see you again in October.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation.

Jim?","Jim Umpleby","Thank you, Amy. Good morning. First, I\u2019d like to thank our team for delivering strong results throughout 2017. After four challenging years, many of our end markets improved and our team capitalized on the opportunity and achieved excellent results. As demand improved during the year, we stayed disciplined and maintained control of our structural costs.","In addition to responding to the increase in volume and delivering strong financial results, we developed and began to implement our new strategy to deliver profitable growth by focusing on operational excellence, expanded offerings and services.","Economic indicators are positive at the moment and we expect a strong start to 2018. Our focus on operational excellence will not waver as we work to develop a more competitive and flexible cost structure, including implementing lean manufacturing principles.","We are positioned to capitalize on continued sales momentum or quickly adjust should conditions change. We also plan to profitably grow the company by investing in expanded offerings and services, the two additional major focus areas in our strategy.","Let me give you some examples of the progress we\u2019ve made thus far. In 2017, we introduced our first model of our next-generation of excavators. This is our first major excavator redesign in 25 years and just one example of our focus on expanded offerings to provide a range of products to better serve the diverse needs of our customers.","We also increased our focus on services, including the aftermarket support in digital enabled solutions. We continue to grow our connected asset population and recently acquired two rail service companies.","We are in the early stages of implementing our strategy for profitable growth. In 2018, we expect to make additional investments in the expanded offerings and services that are important for Caterpillar\u2019s long term success and we\u2019ll use their operating and execution model to bias resources to areas that represent the greatest opportunity for return on our investments.","I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what our team accomplished in 2017 and I\u2019m looking forward to the opportunities ahead.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brad.","Brad Halverson","Well thanks, Jim. It really was a great quarter with improved sales across all regions and nearly all end market. The team delivered strong margins while also investing in targeted initiatives to help us grow the business profitably. Today, I\u2019m going to walk through both the quarter, the full year 2017 and then I will move onto discuss our outlook.","Let\u2019s start with slide four. On the topline sales and revenues of $12.9 billion were up 35% from the fourth quarter of 2016. The largest driver of the sales increase was volume, driven by an increase in end user demand for new equipment across all of our regions.","We saw the largest increase in North America, with improved demand for construction equipment as well as our onshore oil and gas equipment. For the bottom line we lost $2.18 per share in the quarter versus a loss of $2 per share in 2016. And adjusted profit per share was $2.16 in the current quarter, up $1.33 from the fourth quarter of 2016. It\u2019s important to note that adjusted profit per share excludes several large adjustments including the impact of U.S. tax reform, restructuring cost, mark-to-market losses for the re-measurement of pension and OPEB plans, state deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments and a goodwill impairment charge we took in 2016.","The largest of the adjustments to profit per share was the estimated impact of the U.S. tax reform on our 2017 results. I will talk more about the impact of U.S. tax reform in a few minutes. But you can also find more detail in each of these adjustments on page 14 of the press release.","Let\u2019s turn to slide five and we\u2019ll look at the reconciliation of operating profit for the quarter. As you can see fourth quarter operating profit was $1.2 billion compared with the loss of $1.3 billion in 2016.","The positive changes in operating profit came from several areas with the largest being higher sales volume. We saw higher end user demand in all regions and in our three primary segments.","About half of the sales growth was in construction industries led by strong end user demand in North America and Asia Pacific. And about half of the increase in Asia Pacific was due to higher sales into China.","EAME and Latin America sales were also up. For Energy & Transportation the strength of the North America onshore oil and gas continued to be the largest driver of sales growth. In addition, sales were up across all applications in E&T.","We saw higher shipments of locomotives, higher rail services driven by increased rail traffic, strong economic fundamentals for industrial engine applications and several large power generation deals that were in the fourth quarter.","Resource industries had their strongest quarter for sales to users in over two years as miners began to increase capital expenditures. Aftermarket parts demand remained high to support increased mining activity and also to support overalls and rebuilds.","Favorable changes to dealer inventories also impacted our sales. Despite higher end user demand, dealer inventory was about flat in the quarter, compared with an 800 million inventory reduction in the fourth quarter of 2016.","However, with increased global demand, we believe dealer inventories for machines remained lean at 3.1 month of sales. This is up slightly in terms of monthly sales from the end of the third quarter of 2017, but still below historical norms.","As we expected price realization was less favorable than the third quarter of 2017, but was still positive 213 million. The favorable change was primarily due to construction industry and was largely the result of a weak pricing environment a year ago and price action taken in 2017.","Variable manufacturing cost were favorable 170 million, largely due to cost absorption as inventories remained about flat versus a significant reduction in inventories in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Coming off four years of decline, the production increases we saw throughout the year challenged our suppliers. We are working closely with them to reduce lead time and raise production levels; however, we have seen lead times extend on some products.","Despite these challenges, we remain focused on getting product to customers quickly, but also efficiently executing on the lean principles that we are continuing to implement across our factories.","Total period costs were higher by $482 million; the largest driver of this increase was higher short-term incentive compensation expense; however cost were also up as we increase spending on targeted investment aimed at profitable growth initiatives as well as to support higher production levels.","As a positive factors on the profit walk for the quarter, with favourable moves and restructuring cost mark-to-market and goodwill. Restructuring cost were $150 million favorable versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Mark-to-market losses on the re-measurement of our pension and OPEB plan were $301 million, which was $684 million less than the loss we recognized in 2016.","And we saw a favourable impact from the absence of the goodwill impairment of $595 million that resource industries recognized in the fourth of 2016.","Now let\u2019s move on to review the full year starting on slide six. We started 2017 by preparing from what could have been another down year. However, we quickly saw increased demand in a few end markets, which spread as the year progressed. Then by the end of the year, all regions in the three primary segments saw increases in sales. That\u2019s the first time in a very long time that we can say that.","For the year sales and revenues were $45.5 billion, which is up 18% from 2016, a strong start to the year for construction in China, North American gas compression and mining rebuild ended with increases in construction demand across all regions, mining fleas being put back to work, orders for new mining equipment increasing and strong demand for onshore oil and gas equipment in North America.","Profit per share for the full year was $1.26 versus a loss of $0.11 in 2016. Adjusted profit per share was $6.88 about double 2016's adjusted profit per share of $3.42. Again, adjusted profit per share for the full year excludes several large adjustments and we provided a reconciliation of those in Q&A number one of the release.","Let\u2019s turn to slide seven; we\u2019ll look at operating profit for the full year. 2017 operating profit was about $4.4 billion, compared with about $500 million in 2016. By far the most significant drivers of profit was the higher sales volume, with nearly half that increasing construction industries led by China, but followed by improvement in North America.","Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation rotation contributed about equally to the remaining sales growth. For resource industries, aftermarket parts demand was strong for builds to put mining fleets back to work and to support higher fleet utilization.","Changes to dealer inventories were favorable and end-user demand for equipment improved in the second half. The increase in sales for Energy & Transportation was led by strong demand for North American oil, onshore oil and gas. However, for the full year sales were up across all four Energy & Transportation applications.","2017 was also a good year for price realization, although keep in mind 2016 price realization was significantly negative. Most of the price realization in 2017 was in construction industries.","When we look at variable manufacturing cost, we saw favorable $433 million largely due to cost absorption, as we increased inventory to support higher production levels in 2017 as compared to reducing inventories in 2016.","For the full year material costs were just slightly unfavorable with most of the impact coming in the second half. Material cost reduction actions do not completely offset the headwinds from higher steel cost.","Total period cost were higher by $928 million, however excluding short-term incentive compensation expense, period costs were favorable for the year, largely a result of continued cost reductions and restructuring actions.","Restructuring cost was unfavorable $237 million. In 2017, restructuring cost were $1.3 billion, with about half due to the decision to close the Gosselies Belgium facility. The full year results also benefited from a decrease in mark-to-market losses and the absence of a goodwill impairment that I discussed earlier.","We ended the year with a strong balance sheet. Our year-end debt to cap ratio was 36.7% and enterprise cash balance was $8.3 billion. In the fourth quarter, we made a $1 billion discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plans and we retired $900 million of debt that was due in December 2018.","Before I discuss our capital allocation priorities, first I want to cover the impacts of the U.S. tax reform bill that was passed in December.","Let\u2019s move to slide eight. As I discuss U.S. tax reform I will break it into two sections; the impact on our 2017 results and the long-term benefits of the bill. First let\u2019s talk about the impact of 2017 results. The fourth quarter provision for income taxes included a charge of about $2.4 billion as a result of the enactment of U.S. tax reform. There are two primary components of this charge; the first is about $600 million right down of our net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction and the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This is a non-cash item.","The remainder of the charge is largely the cost of the mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. These charges reflect a reasonable estimate as of January 18, 2018. However, these estimates may change as additional guidance is issued; assumptions are refined and any potential actions that could be taken as a result of the legislation.","Now let\u2019s look at the long term impacts of the new tax legislation. We believe the U.S. tax reform is positive for Caterpillar over the long-term, and then it provides a more competitive environment for us, both domestically and around the world by creating a more level playing field against our non-U.S. competitors. The reform also provides greater flexibility to access our cash in order to deliver on our capital allocation priorities.","Finally the new tax law lowers the U.S. corporate tax rate. We have included the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform in our 2018 Outlook. However, it\u2019s important to stress that the new U.S. tax law does not change our cash deployment priorities. I\u2019d like to now discuss our cash deployment priorities as this has been a topic of interest recently.","Our top priority continues to be maintaining a strong financial position to support our Mid-A credit rating. Next we will fund our operational requirements and our commitments, then we intend to fund profitable growth aligned with our strategy which includes operational excellence, expanded offerings and services. Returning capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases remains important","Now let\u2019s look at the 2018 Outlook on slide nine. Today are providing a 2018 Outlook for profit per share in a range of $7.75 to $8.75 and an adjusted profit per share range of $8.25 to $9.25. We are moving away from providing a sales and revenue Outlook range as our new company strategy is focused of profitable growth through the cycle.","In -- for 2018 we are beginning the year with strong order rate and increasing backlog and lean dealer inventory. In addition, the global economy is the strongest it has been in several years with nearly every region of the world expected to grow in 2018.","However, we know the market can change quickly, so while we are working in our factory and with our suppliers to support higher production levels across a number of products we also remain committed to a flexible and competitive cost structure that can respond quickly if demand changes.","Now let\u2019s walk through some outlook assumptions in each of our three primary segments, if we move to slide 10. For construction industries, the pie on the right breaks out our 2017 sales by region for construction industries. In 2018, we expect all regions to improve and segment sales to be higher.","For North America, we expect improvement in both residential and non-residential construction. And after many years of disappointing under investment in infrastructure, we expect demand to be up slightly in 2018.","We have not incorporated any impacts from a potential U.S. infrastructure bill on our outlook, and if one were passed, it would be positive, but we were not expect it to materially impact our 2018 results.","We expect Latin America to continue to recover a bit of what continues to be a very low base versus historical trends. Europe continues to deliver stable and steady growth across most of the regions. We believe stabilizing oil prices and attractive commodity prices should also be better for Africa, the Middle East and the CIs countries. Lastly, we expect to see continued growth in Asia-Pacific led by China. Our forecast is for China to remain strong for the first half of the year and then slow in the second half which reflects normal seasonality.","In addition to China, we expect most other countries in Asia-Pacific to grow, largely driven by investments in infrastructure. Now let\u2019s look at resource industries on slide 11. Resource industries all signals indicate continued growth in mining. Most commodity prices are above investment thresholds and are driving increases in mining production.","We build an aftermarket demand should continue as the parked fleet comes back online. And an extension of existing mines should drive demand for new equipment. In addition, we believe most miners have returned to profitability and we expect their capital spending to increase in 2018, with the growing share spent on sustaining capital expenditures.","In addition to strong mining activity, global economic growth should also be a positive for heavy construction equipment, which is included in resource industries.","Let\u2019s move to slide 12 and look at Energy & Transportation. Again, the slide shot on the right reflects a breakout of 2017 sales by application. We expect sales for Energy & Transportation to be up for the full year. While we expect oil prices to remain volatile, we anticipate continued strength in oil and gas in 2018 led by demand for onshore oil and gas equipment in North America.","In addition, we expect demand for drilling equipment to remain soft as it was for all of 2017. For solar turbines the current backlog is healthy, largely driven by the midstream pipeline business. We also expect [offshore oil] activity to remain weak. Power generation sales are forecasted to be up, after a multi-year downturn, sales into industrial engine applications are expected to be about flat, and transportation sales are expected to be up, largely due to recent acquisition in rail services. The Locomotive and Marine businesses remain challenged.","Now if we look to slide 13, I\u2019ll talk about a few more items impacting our 2018 outlook. Higher sales volume is the largest driver of the improvement in the profit outlook. We are also expecting period cost excluding short-term incentive compensation changes to increase due to wage inflation as well as targeted investments in profitable growth initiative for expanded offering and services.","We expect short-term incentive compensation expense to be about $900 million. Additionally while market conditions are favorable, the pricing environment remains competitive. As a result, we expect slightly favorable price realization to be mostly offset by unfavorable material cost, largely driven by higher commodity prices.","The 2017 gain on the sale of securities and financial products is not planned to repeat. We expect restructuring cost to be about $400 million for the full year. We have an estimated, a 24% tax rate which includes the impacts of U.S. tax reform. As has been our historical practice, we have not assumed any share buyback in our outlook. We expect to continue delivering strong performance with improving operating margins as we execute on our strategy focused on operational excellence and profitable growth.","So to summarize on slide 14, we had a great fourth quarter and a great 2017. Our team managed cost as production ramped up. We delivered improved margins across the three primary segments and maintained a strong balance sheet. As we start 2018 we are seeing improving economic indicators across many of our end markets, and we are executing on our strategy with profitable growth and a focus on expanded offerings and services.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to you Amy.","Amy Campbell","Thank you Brad. Before we begin the Q&A portion of the call, I just want to take a minute to announce a slight change in the release of retail staff. So we will continue in the month when there is not a nine and of the quarterly release we are going to move the release of retail staffs from before the market opens until after the market opens the day before the release.","So in the month of the release retail stats will be released after the market closes the day before the release. So with that Kate, I\u2019ll move it back to you to begin the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.","Andrew Casey","Well Fargo Securities, and good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the Q4 segment margins they declined sequentially in an all three of the major equipment categories despite higher sequential revenue, and I know some of it is related to short-term incentive comp, but could you provide some further detail on really what drove that sequential margin performance?","Amy Campbell","Sure, Andy. I think a couple of things. If we step back, keep in mind that we are playing operating margins over the long term and not quarter to quarter. There were a couple of things in the quarter that did drive segment margins down. I think if you look at ENT margins they were actually up, so I\u2019ll talk through CI and resource industry that the consolidated level, the biggest driver was period cost absorbed. So if you look at cat inventory growth through 2017, we saw inventory grow through the first three quarters and then actually come down in the fourth quarter largely driven by turbine and rail shipments, but also in the other segments as well.","So from a sequential perspective, there was less favorable cost absorption into inventory as inventory came down slightly in the quarter versus growing in the three quarters prior to that. And for resource industries, I mean Brad talked about this in the script. For the first quarter we really saw a significant increase in new equipment sales, which had a slight impact on margin, still very good margin, strong margins for the year the second highest quarter for the full year, but that did drive some of the sequential erosion and margins for resource industry.","Jim Umpleby","And Andy, this is Jim. I can just add, just expand upon on some of Amy\u2019s comments. We\u2019re really trying to focus on the long term here, and we are focused on improving margins overtime to achieve our long-term profitable growth objectives. So there will be less emphasis on short-term incremental margins, and more emphasis on the long-term.","Having said that, we do expect improved operating margins in all three segments in 2018 compared to 2017 on an annual basis.","Andrew Casey","Okay, thank you. And then one last one on the backlog growth, when we and others and you mentioned in the call do our channel checks in order to deliver lead times are extending. It seems like some of that is concentrating construction industries but the backlog was pretty flat. Is there something else going on within construction industries that kind of offset the implied building backlog?","Amy Campbell","The sales for construction industries were up 47% in the quarter and construction continues to ramp up supply to meet demand. Many of construction industries products are on managed distribution, so with that they take orders for current month plus two or three. And so there\u2019s not unconstrained demand coming through the backlog. And so that\u2019s really the driver of why you didn\u2019t see a more significant increase in the backlog for construction industries. They do continue to ramp supply up to meet demand, and they are focused on getting every shipment to a customer order, and making sure that the customer demands are being met. Does that answer your question, Andy?","Andrew Casey","For the most part, I\u2019ll take the rest offline. Thank you.","Amy Campbell","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joel Tiss. Please announce your affiliation, and then pose your question.","Joel Tiss","Bank of Montreal. I wondered if you could talk about the key focal areas of your operational excellence and the simplification. And maybe if you can comment in that same vein on maybe medium-term if that 25% incremental margin that you guys have targeted over the long-term would start to change, would start to move up a little bit?","Jim Umpleby","Good morning, this is Jim. I\u2019ll take that one. As we look at our operating execution model and operational excellence, there is really a number of elements that we are focused on. In terms of operational excellence, it\u2019s safety, quality and lean, so we are very much focused on getting more production out of existing bricks and mortar. We talked about that a bit at investor day. So we don\u2019t anticipate investing in new factories, what we are really doing is meeting the increased demand through lean manufacturing advances and also frankly, we have plenty of bricks and mortar.","And so we did talk about an operating range for all three segments at investor day. We are very still committed to meeting those ranges based upon the revenue levels that we stated at the time. There will be fluctuations over time and we are not just focused on increasing margins although we are committed to meeting those targets. We also want to grow the business, and so we\u2019ll be investing to grow the business while staying within those ranges.","Joel Tiss","And then just a follow up, does the, does the tax, the new tax legislation help you guys reach a settlement any quicker with the government over your long-term tax dispute?","Jim Umpleby","We really can\u2019t comment on this. I\u2019m sure you can imagine, it\u2019s an ongoing discussion with the government. We are co-operating and we hope to get to a resolution in an expeditious manner.","Joel Tiss","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Timothy Thein. Please note your affiliation, then pose your question.","Timothy Thein","Yes, Citigroup. Good morning. Brad or Jim you spoke earlier to the benefit to Cat\u2019s tax rate from the recent tax reform. I\u2019m curious how you are thinking about the potential for some -- the repatriation of what I believe to be is 5 plus billion dollars of foreign cash. So maybe just some, some thoughts around that.","Brad Halverson","Yes, this is Brad. Thank you. We are really happy with tax reform in a lot of different areas. There has been a lot of good momentum around smart regulation and now tax reform. As it relates to our cash it gives us a lot more flexibility in our decision making in terms of how to use that cash. And one thing that we had talked about in terms of U.S. competitiveness is that when you put on an added tax on charge of using cash in the U.S. that tends to bias your investments. And so now basically that that added taxes been removed and so provides really a level playing field for cash.","And so, we\u2019re really happy with where our balance sheet was coming out of the downturn and what's happened this year. We were happy to make the contribution to the pension plan as well as to pay down some debt. It's in really good shape. And if you look at the outlook for 2018 that\u2019s positive. We\u2019re not going to give any details as to exactly when we would use that, but our priorities as I outlined in the call, I think remain consistent with our strategy in terms of the credit rating, funding our business and then using it to grow.","And return to shareholders remains important. We\u2019ve had a very long history of dividend growth which we\u2019re proud of and that remains important. And we view share buybacks in the future. So you probably want a little bit more but that's where we\u2019re at right now.","Timothy Thein","Okay. Understood. And then second is just on that the backlog and resources and really what kind of the implied profitability of those orders. And I'm wondering if you're seeing any kind of signs of broadening out in terms of order trends by geography and really by payload in terms of size and the machines. It looks from an industry perspective anyway that's really this little recovery with more the deliveries had been directed more towards regions where CAT share wouldn\u2019t necessarily be as favored. So I\u2019m just curious if you're kind of seeing a broadening out to more the traditional mining regions. So any comments there it would be helpful? Thank you.","JimUmpleby","Yes. This is Jim. So we are seeing increased demand really in all regions for our mining products, that\u2019s a positive thing, so it is a \u2013 again we\u2019re coming off a very low levels as you as you know, but it is a broad \u2013 it started to be broad-based in terms of showing improvement in regions around the world.","Timothy Thein","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Ann Duignan","Hi. Good morning. JPMorgan.","Jim Umpleby","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Duignan","I\u2019m curious philosophically why you have decided not to provide revenue guidance or at least revenue guidance ranges by segment, I mean, this is an era where investors I think are looking for more transparency not less. And then, as a follow-on to that, I mean, what should we contemplate in our models to get to the low end of your guidance versus the high end of your guidance. Is that range in revenue or is it range of profitability or an inability to get the supply chain fixed. And if you could just talk about what's in the model that you\u2019re looking it to get to the low end and the high end?","Jim Umpleby","Ann, this is Jim, I\u2019ll start then I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy or Brad. Again consistent what we talked about it at investor day we\u2019re moving away from providing sales forecast and we try to grow the company profitably over the long haul. And we believe that that providing an EPS range is an appropriate way to go. Why don't you take it from there, Amy, and I'll jump back in.","Amy Campbell","Yes. I think if you look at the range of adjusted PPS that was provided Ann, and I think we were pretty clear about this. Clearly the biggest driver in profit growth is sales volume and so that\u2019s going to have the biggest impact on the sales range, and so your sales assumption will drive you \u2013 is a key component of driving you to different parts of that range, there\u2019s also lots of other variables around cost, price, material cost that could push you a different part in the range as well, but the volume is clearly the most significant driver of growth.","I would say its not supply constraints, while we talk about the supply constraints and we continue to ramp suppliers and get production up, in the adjusted profit guidance that we provided supplier constraints are not any issue and we don\u2019t expect them to be an issue I should say. I will step back and say though, if you look at the overall performance we expect operating margins for the consolidated company, and for all three segments to improve from where we ended 2017 and we\u2019re looking as \u2013 Jim talked about the long game not quarter over quarter pulled throughs, but long-term margin performance. And for Cat, that actually put the operating margin in the range as we provided at Investor Day at lower volume.","And so I think that's really reflective of strong performance delivering on the profitable growth that we\u2019re committed to.","Bradley Halverson","And again, we see sales increasing in all three segments, again as Amy mentioned, operating margins will increase in all three segments as well 2017 to 2018.","Ann Duignan","The ranges in 2018, I just want to make sure, I get this absolutely correct. The ranges for operating performance for each segment in 2018 will be within the ranges you gave at the Analyst Meeting on lower volumes?","Joe Creed","This is Joe. So not each segment, I think what Amy was saying there at the company level way it works out we expect to be in the range, but not every segment will be there. We\u2019re working our way toward thereby improving year-over-year.","Ann Duignan","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. I appreciate this.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","David Raso","Hi. Evercore ISI. The incremental margins for 2018, what do you expecting in incremental margins?","Amy Campbell","We haven\u2019t provided incremental margin guidance, David. If you step back and I think repeat what I just said to Ann. Its strong operating performance overall, it\u2019s an improvement in operating margin for the company that puts the company operating margin in the ranges that we provided at Investor Day and shows improvement for all three segments in the 2018. And for construction industries, they actually ended the year at the top into that range, so they\u2019re showing a little bit of improvement on top of that.","David Raso","And I apologize to push, but I know that\u2019s a scripted answer, but incremental margins in particular they were 30% for the equipment company in the fourth quarter, 40 the prior two quarters. Can you give us, at least, a perspective how you expect incrementals to be in 2018 versus what they were of late?","Amy Campbell","I think what I can say is that we expect them to continue deliver strong performance early in the cycle, the pull-through are strong and you see if you look through a quarter over quarter pull-through, they do start to slow down which makes a lot of sense as you bring production back on line. We are committed to investing in growth through the P&L next year. But we still expect and know strong performance and to continue to deliver good returns, good operational margin increases on the sales growth.","David Raso","And again sorry to push, but versus the 30 for the fourth quarter, are we expecting to be higher or lower. I mean it's a simple math. If incrementals are 25 next year you're implying sales guide up around 15, I mean we can do the math. If the incrementals are 30 it's more like 12.5% top line. So we can do the math. We\u2019re just trying to think structurally just more of a revenue year where hey, the incrementals are little bit lower, we\u2019re investing in the business or maybe a little supply constraint and keep the revenues low but will still give you a big incremental. That\u2019s -- we\u2019re just trying to get a feel. Are the incremental similar to the fourth quarter or lower or may be even higher?","Amy Campbell","So, I think it\u2019s clear, I\u2019m not going to answer that question directly. Incrementals for the full year of 2017 were 40%, that's pretty high. It is -- 2018 is largely a year of sales growth, that\u2019s clearly the biggest driver and the profit per share growth. And even with a nice, steep tailwinds we are looking at investing in the business, investing through the P&L, growing our digital and online offerings, investing in products, and so I don\u2019t have an exact answer for you David, but\u2026","David Raso","A nice push. So I guess also on the revenue growth, if say, the framework is 25 incrementals, 15% top line and you have a little less CAT financial income, we get that. The backlog and orders are up roughly about 30% year-over-year. If you can help us meet with the dealer inventory for 2018, what is expected for that, so at least we have a sense of that swing?","Amy Campbell","Yes. So dealer inventory, we have been pretty transparent into the year lean and dealers we would expect they would typically grow dealer inventory in the first quarter to get ready for the spring selling season. We\u2019ll see if it happens again this year. If you look broadly at the dealer inventory composition, I\u2019d say in total we\u2019re pretty comfortable with it, but there are a few regions most notably China where dealer inventories are low. And so we would expect in a few regions for there likely to be some but not that much material dealer inventory growth in 2018.","David Raso","So not that material, let me go back to 2010 and 2011 when you\u2019re building the inventory would go up 900 million then obviously 2011 and 2012 we\u2019re up notably large. We should not assume 1 billion plus type dealer inventory increase, when you say moderate sort of in the hundreds of millions. Is that fair?","Amy Campbell","No. We would not assume as much as we had on those earlier years.","David Raso","Okay. Terrific. I appreciate it. Thanks for help. Sorry to push.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. I guess two questions. Amy, sorry to push again on 2018, but is there anything you can help us with regard to mix in 2018 versus 2017, because obviously that would have big impact on incremental margins? And then my second question I know guys that some on capital allocation haven\u2019t really change your strategy, but also in your guidance you do say, our numbers don\u2019t assume any share purchase which you usually don't put in your guidance, that -- to specify, we\u2019re not including share purchase. I'm just wondering if you are trying to signal something? Thanks.","Amy Campbell","Yes. So for mix, I\u2019ll start there. So, if you look at it, there are lots of puts and takes for 2018 guidance, really they largely met out and it is a sales story. For mix particularly it\u2019s really not very meaningful and probably slightly unfavorable as we see for resource industries move to a larger percentage of their sales base being new equipment as opposed to aftermarket parts. So there\u2019s just a shift in that sales, but overall and even for resource industries it\u2019s a fairly small negative.","In terms of share repurchase I think we just put that in there to be clear that in accordance of historical practice we don\u2019t assume share buyback and I think given the changes in U.S. tax reform and a lot of discussion we just wanted to clear on what our guidance is. We don\u2019t usually state that but that how we always put the outlook together at the beginning of the year.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning. It\u2019s RBC. I wanted to ask you couple of questions on construction. It sounds like you\u2019re messaging that -- I think on the last quarter call you kind of message that you thought China would be -- had potential to be softer here in the first half of the or first part of the year. But it sounds like today you\u2019re sort of saying, you think China is strong at least through the first half and maybe softens in the back half. Did something change there or you more confident on the Chinese construction equipment market?","Amy Campbell","Yes. So, yes, I\u2019d say, we are more confident on the Chinese construction market than we were a quarter ago. We\u2019ve continue to see that market remain very strong. If you \u2013 we are forecasting industry growth for the 10-ton-and-above excavator which are the numbers we normally cite, to be up about 8% next year in the outlook. We were not there just a quarter ago, so I think that's reflective of continued \u2013 seen continued strength in the Chinese economy.","I will say, if you look at the 2017 sales cadence, it did not follow historical norms. We saw continued acceleration in the industry as the year progressed. And what we highlighted in the release and in Brad\u2019s comments is we don't expect to repeat, so we would expect China to revert back to more normal sales patterns with 60% to 65% of sales in the first half of the year and then for that to slow down considerably in the back half of the year. I will be ready if that's not the case, but that\u2019s currently our assumption.","We do think that the Chinese market is currently above normal replacement demand and will slow at some point. But our current read on the market that it\u2019s going to remains strongly at least through the first half of the year. Is that answers your question, sir.","Seth Weber","Yes. That\u2019s perfect. Thanks Amy. And if I just quickly follow-up the more positive view towards North America infrastructure, I think in your prepared remarks is the first time you've kind of been able to make that statement in a while. What's driving that and what are you seeing out there that's give you confidence that that's going to get better?","Amy Campbell","North America construction?","Seth Weber","Sorry, infrastructure.","Amy Campbell","North America infrastructure. So we\u2019ve had FAST Act. That's been in play for several years now. We didn\u2019t see really much impact to that in 2017, but our channel check, look like that we\u2019re going to start to see some of that spending that was approved at the state and local level start to come through and drive some infrastructure growth in 2018.","Seth Weber","Okay. Thanks for the color guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Fisher. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Stephen Fisher","Thank you. Good morning. It\u2019s UBS. You guys call out the tightness in the supply chain. I wonder if you could just give a little more color on where exactly that tightness is and what did you actually assume that the supply chain has to do to meet demand just sort of comfortable that you didn't get over your skis with the assumptions this year. They need to make some big structural or capacity changes or is it just adding shifts or what has to be worked out there?","Jim Umpleby","Hello. Steve, this is Jim. So as I mentioned earlier, we believe we have plenty of internal manufacturing capacity, but as is the case with previous ramp ups, we are dealing with some constraints with our suppliers and we\u2019re working through one by one. There isn\u2019t one big issues, it\u2019s kind of across the board and we\u2019re working with our suppliers to break our way through those. We do feel confident that supplier constraints will not be an issue that would prevent us from achieving the EPS range which we put out this morning.","Stephen Fisher","Okay. And then can you just frame the 1 to 1.5 billion of CapEx a bit more, because at the midpoint that would be about a 30% to 40% increase off of your arguably low levels and I know it still below your machinery depreciation, but you\u2019ve also said, just now you got plenty of capacity. So what's the increase therefore? Is that for automation or efficiency investments? Is it tax benefit motivated? If you could just kind of frame that a little bit?","Amy Campbell","Steve, I see over the last several years spend kind of $1 billion to $1.3 billion in CapEx. In 2017 it came in a little bit below $1 billion, so some of that is, we spend a little less than we anticipated. In 2017 we thought we\u2019d spend closer to $1 billion, $1.2 billion. What\u2019s driving that, a lot of that is maintaining the capital, the machines and the facilities that we have. There are capital demands as we restructure and consolidate facilities to put lines in and so moving production from one facility to another. Those are the largest drivers of the capital increases in 2018.","Jim Umpleby","And this is Jim, maybe just to add some color to that. Traditionally, we thought about growth at Caterpillar, investing in R&D and investing in capital in terms of building new factories. That's been really the portion as we expand our horizons here and really push toward services. We\u2019ll be investing through the P&L as well. It won\u2019t be just be capital to try to grow, so it's particularly important as we look at enhancing our digital capabilities and doing other things there as well. Again we\u2019ll be investing through the P&L growth.","Stephen Fisher","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Jerry Revich","Hi. Good morning everyone. It\u2019s Goldman Sachs.","Amy Campbell","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Jim, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about the operate and execute plan. So, we really saw the sales variance allocation piece really move the needle for you folks in 2017, and as we think about based on what you folks have in the pipeline which we look for has being meaningful improvements in the business in 2018?","Jim Umpleby","Well, it is really \u2013 again, this is long-term game so we\u2019re focus on long-term profitable growth and as you heard us talk about before really comes down to us having a more detailed granular understanding of byproduct, by application, by market where we get the best return on invested capital and we\u2019re biasing our resources to those areas that represent the best opportunity for future profitable growth where we\u2019ll get the best returns. And so, I think difficult for you to see \u2013 for us to predict in 2018, which you\u2019ll see it\u2019s a long-term game, but again their focus on services as I mentioned is very important and we\u2019re invest in but it is up against the long haul.","Jerry Revich","Thank you. And then on the supply chain you folks are very clear within the contemplated range you don't anticipate supply chain being an issue. Can you just give us confidence range, sales are 10% above the high-end of the range which you still feel comfortable with that assessment. There if you could just help us understand the confidence spend that you have and you spoke about in the press release improving material flows back of 2017 verse of the first half based on your work with the supply chain. I\u2019m wonder, if you could just quantify the number of problem components that you\u2019re tracking or just help us, quantify that improvement if you don\u2019t mind?","Jim Umpleby","Yes. I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate for us to give you -- quantify the number of suppliers, but again I'll just repeat that that we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll be able to work with our suppliers to get within the EPS range that we provided. This is not something, it\u2019s unusual we've gone to this in the past and it won\u2019t be a major problem for us.","Jerry Revich","And sorry, Jim, what if demand higher than the high end of the range, or guess what\u2019s the level of confidence that you scale up to. Is it 10%, 15%?","Jim Umpleby","I\u2019m not going to quantify, but it certainly, if its more demand out there, we\u2019ll do our best to work with our suppliers to satisfy that incremental demand.","Jerry Revich","Thank you. Thank you next question today is coming from Mig Dobre. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Mig Dobre","Yes. Good morning. It\u2019s Baird. Just wanted to go back to construction industries if we can, and maybe give you view on North American demand maybe frame that is how our thinking your 2018 outlook versus normalized demand or mid cycle. And I guess, I\u2019m wondering, in your comment in the slide here that talks about improvement in residential, non-residential an infrastructure. What do you feel most comfortable that you\u2019re going to see the improvement. And what does that in terms of equipment next year in 2018?","Amy Campbell","So, Mig, I\u2019ll start with where we had normalized demand. I think we are trying to get our way from calling the cycles. North America sales were in 2017 and we expect them to be up again in 2018, so we\u2019re at \u2013 were healthy sales levels, where exactly that is in the cycle and if we\u2019re going to pull from trying to predict that.","I would say, exactly where we\u2019re going to see the strength in 2018. I don\u2019t have that broken out between residential, non-residential infrastructure. We do see strong demand signals across all three. I\u2019ll say that infrastructure has disappointed us the last couple of years. Hopefully it don\u2019t this year, we\u2019ll see how the year plays out. But there certainly the need and there certainly the funding out there to fund infrastructure growth, another areas of strength in construction industries as pipeline build out and so we\u2019re seeing which requires a lot of heavy equipment, construction equipment even some apply to small end of resource industries equipment.","So as pipelines are getting build out in support of the oil and gas activity and there\u2019s been a lot of pipelines approved in the last year, that\u2019s certainly a key areas of growth as well and an area where we\u2019ve seen really good business.","Mig Dobre","Okay. And that\u2019s actually kind of good segue on my second question moving to energy and transportation, maybe a little bit more color on the oil and gas component of that business and your thoughts on solar going forward?","Jim Umpleby","This is Jim. I\u2019ll take that one. So as we mentioned earlier onshore North American oil and gas has been quite strong, it was quite strong in 2017. We expect that strength to continue. Drillings relatively slow but well servicing is certainly and gas compression is quite strong for us. As we also mentioned there\u2019s a good backlog for solar for midstream gas compression. As we look around the world in terms of offshore oil and gas that's still fairly depressed and we don\u2019t see a major increase in that business in 2018. So offshore drilling and offshore solar turbines applications will be relatively muted again in 2018.","Mig Dobre","Appreciate it. Thanks.","Amy Campbell","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from Rob Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Rob Wertheimer","It\u2019s Melius. Good morning everybody and thanks for fitting me in. So the question is I mean, obviously your corporate results has been very, very good especially in margin. The question is on resources where we at least think it's an exceptional business, you have good market shares and the product runs a lot, so the aftermarket position is structurally good. And you had a great last quarter. Rebound in margin, this quarters down a little bit. Then I understand some seasonality to margins I get it. But is there any abnormal investment in that business that\u2019s depressing margin, whether on automation otherwise or what was the cause of that lumpiness that we\u2019ve seen last two or three quarters?","Amy Campbell","Well, the cause in lumpiness probably has a lot to do with the sales changes, although we did see a sales growth in the fourth quarter. We talked about a little bit of negative mix there as they moved to a higher percentage of their sales being new equipment as opposed to aftermarket. We also talked about in the third quarter and we saw this translates that they \u2013 we had pick up and R&D spend for some product programs. We also typically see and you talk about this fourth quarter seasonal cost heaviness as everyone tries to get all their cost out in the quarters.","So at those sales levels I think there is just some lumpiness to the margins. New equipment sales are still really low versus historical standard. We\u2019re managing margin, I\u2019d say to the full year and not to the quarter and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re focused at. We expect RI to continue to see operating margin growth in 2018 in line with progressing towards achieving the margin numbers they put out for Investor Day.","Jim Umpleby","And just to add. This is Jim. Certainly mix has an impact here. So the mix issue between parts in OE, so as OE starts to improve that can have a mix impact and there are certainly impact among different products within OE. So mix is certainly a big part of it particularly when you're dealing with lower levels. Its easier to, I think it have a larger shift due to mix.","Amy Campbell","With that, I think \u2013 sorry Rob go ahead. You can follow-up if you had one.","Rob Wertheimer","Is it fair to interpret from your comments on resources again about the breadth of the recovery in the customer basis. Your order book kind of widening out as you see people -- I mean, more people bid or quote opposed to patchy?","Jim Umpleby","Well, it still a relatively low-levels, but it's improving. So I\u2019d said, we\u2019ve seen an improvement and it is broadening out as well geographically as I mentioned earlier.","Rob Wertheimer","Great. Okay. Thank you, Jim.","Amy Campbell","And with that, Kate, that needs to be our last question.","Operator","Thank you. Do you have any closing comments you\u2019d like to finish with.","Amy Campbell","No. I think we\u2019ll just go ahead. It\u2019s a top of the hour.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Michael DeWalt","Thank you Paul and good morning everyone and welcome to our year-end earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services.","On the call with me this morning, we have our Doug Oberhelman, our Chairman and CEO; and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO.","Now this morning we're going to do the call similar to what we did last October. We'll be going through a short slide deck before we get to the Q&A. And if you don't have it yet the slide deck, it's available on our website, at caterpillar.com and it's with the conference call webcast link.","This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting that in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website and it will be in the section labelled Results Webcast.","This morning we'll be discussing forward-looking information that certainly involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors individually or in the aggregate that could make actual results differ materially from our projections well that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, or which is Risk Factors in our 10-K filed last February and it's in the forward-looking statements language in today\u2019s financial release and near the front of this morning's slide deck.","In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can also be found in our financial release and again that's been posted on our website at caterpillar.com.","Okay. With that, let's get started, if I could ask you to pull out the slide deck and flip to page three and that's the agenda of our slide deck. I'll start this morning with a quick review of the fourth quarter and the full year of '15 and the outlook for 2016. And then I'll hand off to Doug and he'll cover a few of the key points that we were trying to make in this morning's financial release.","So with that, let's flip to what would be page four of the bottom of the slide deck. And this is a fourth quarter 2015 results versus fourth quarter 2004. And you can see on here that sales and revenues are down $3.2 billion from $14.2 billion to $11 billion that's a 23% drop. And I'll kind of talk about that two ways; first about $2.7 billion of that was lower volume, selling fewer things and most of that was lower end user demand, about $400 million of it was related to reductions in dealer inventory.","Price realization was negative in the quarter about $124 million and we did have a stronger dollar versus the fourth quarter of '14, which causes our sales outside the U.S. to translate into fewer dollars and in this case quarter-over-quarter or negative about $400 million. So that's the $3.2 billion. If you look at that by segment, the biggest decline was Energy & Transportation, it was off $1.8 billion. About $8.8 billion of that was CI construction and about half of that, a little more than half of that was where the dealer inventory impact was most concentrated. And then about $0.5 billion was Resource Industries and again that's mostly mining.","So the decline was across the board, but a bit more concentrated quarter-over-quarter in Energy & Transportation and I think given what's happened to oil prices over the course of the past year that's probably not a big surprise. Now the profit impact of those changes - or of that decline in sales volume was about $940 million negative. The next largest item quarter-over-quarter is restructuring costs and they were negative $585 million, they went from $97 million in the fourth quarter a year ago to $682 million this year. And a lot of that increase is a result of the fairly significant actions that we announced last September and are in the middle of implementing right now.","Costs though were favourable about $461 million and that's pretty much all in excluding restructuring versus a year ago, so that's good news. Now taxes, I know it's probably a little hard to follow what's happening with taxes. It was a very low kind of all in tax impact in both quarters. The rate this year is a little lower than last year and we had $85 million of favourable tax items in the fourth quarter of '14 and $77 million in the fourth quarter of '15. So a little bit hard to follow, but not a massive impact quarter-over-quarter. If we look at the profit numbers on the table, up above all in profit in the fourth quarter a year ago was $1.23. We actually had a loss of $0.15 in the fourth quarter of '15 and a lot of that was because of the significant restructuring costs. So the all in change was a decline of the $1.38 a share. Excluding the restructuring costs in '14, the fourth quarter was $1.35, the fourth quarter of '15 was $0.74 and we were down $0.61.","We continue to report our results both with and without restructuring costs. We think it's important to help you understand what's going on in the business.","So that's the fourth quarter, let's look to page 5 that's the full year. It was obviously a tough year for us in 2015. Sales were off $8.2 billion, vast majority of that was lower sales volume, but the stronger dollar impacted the full year in kind of the same way did the quarter. In terms of segments; Energy & Transportation was the largest decline at $3.8 billion, that was oil, rail, electric power. So a fairly widespread within E&T. Construction Industries was down $2.8 billion and Resource Industries $1.4 billion.","So from a profit standpoint all in we were $5.88 in 2014, all in including restructuring, we dropped to $3.50 in 2015 and that's a decline of $2.38 a share, more than all of that is the decline in volume. If you take out restructuring costs, we were $6.38 in '14 and $4.64 in '15 down $1.74. And I think the story for '15 is big sales headwind $8.2 billion, but we worked really hard on lowering costs. We took significant restructuring actions and new restructuring actions began in the third quarter. Our costs were about $520 million favourable and that's net of about $350 million of unfavorable cost absorptions, so let me explain that a little bit.","In 2014 sales were pretty flat with 2013, not a big change. So inventory didn't change much. It was about $400 million in '14, so inventory absorption wasn't a big deal in '14. In '15, inventory declined $2.5 billion, so that's $2.1 billion more than it did in 2015 and there's a pretty significant cost impact of that sizable decline in inventory, order of magnitude 350 and so without that cost would have been even more favourable.","Share count was positive to profit year-over-year, about $0.16 a share and that's - a lot of that is the full year impact of the significant repurchases we did in '14 and a partial year impact of the repurchases that we did in '15. Overall bottom line all in on tax, not much change year-over-year. So that's the full year and if you take out the restructuring costs, I would just mention that our decremental operating profit margins were about 20%. And we would consider that to be pretty good performance, it's better than our 25% to 30% target.","So let's flip to the next page, page 6. Now page 6 is a little discussion on how we did versus our outlook and in this case we're, since so much transpired over the year. We're kind of taking a long look back, how did we do versus what we told you we thought we would do a year ago right now in our year end call for '14. Then how did we come out versus the outlook that we had in place at the end of October, the last conference call that we had the third quarter financial release.","So if you look down the numbers in January, a year ago we were expecting sales and revenues this year to be $50 billion, profit per share to be $4.60, restructuring cost to be only $150 million and then profit per share excluding those restructuring costs to be around $4.75. Now what we actually had was sales and revenues that were $47 billion and that's in the third column, which were $3 billion below where we thought they would be, when we started the year. I think everything that happened with oil prices, commodities in general, increased weakness in China. Most of the sales decline that we actually had in '15 we had anticipated that outlook, we were down from that about $3 billion.","Profit per share is lower by $1.10 and quite a bit of that is restructuring costs, were a lot higher and again that's because we announced pretty substantial new actions in September. So excluding restructuring costs we were at $4.64 and that's $0.11 a share shy of where our outlook was when we started the year. I think our view would be on a $3 billion sales decline, even given all the puts and takes that's pretty good performance.","Now versus the last outlook that we provided in late October of 2015, we said our outlook was going to be about $48 billion and we kind of clarified that a little further, as somewhere in the range of $47 billion and $48 billion. We were looking at profit per share of $3.70 and that included $800 million of restructuring costs. Then excluding restructuring we were looking at $4.60. Well, what we actually did was a little worse on sales. It's been a continuing, challenging environment. Profit per share was lower and that's largely because we had more restructuring costs than we expected at the time. Excluding restructuring, we ended up the year at $4.64, actually a little ahead of our outlook. Now I've seen a few of this morning's analyst reports and for sure we did not have the tax extenders in our previous outlook. So that was an unanticipated benefit for us and in several analyst reports I think you picked that up.","The flipside of that is we also had a fairly sizable charge for legal matter in our fourth quarter, we didn't expect that either and it really wasn't related to operations, if you will in the quarter and those two items about offset each other. So I would say all in, despite lower sales we did a little bit better than our outlook and we're pretty pleased with that.","So let's talk about 2016, a lot going on in 2016. So let's flip to page 7; first we'll do sales and revenues. It looks to us, like another tough year, we don't really; we're not forecasting any real improvement in the overall world economy. We're not banking on commodities getting better and as a result of that we're looking at $40 billion to $44 billion in sales and revenues, a midpoint there is about $42 billion. Now that is about $3.5 billion below where we were thinking last October, when we gave a preliminary outlook. I think that's probably not too surprising to most of you with continued slide in oil prices to down around $30 a share and I would say continuing concern and worry around emerging markets, particularly China.","So as we look at next year and what we think will happen with sales or what we're expecting, another down year for Energy & Transportation down 10% to 15%. Now quite a bit of that decline is around timing, so we knew oil prices were coming down last year. We expected that to weaken party substantially in 2014 and it did. But most of that reduction was in the second half of the year. We started 2014 with a pretty sizable backlog and we sold out the backlog for the first half of the year in Energy & Transportation, particularly in the reciprocating engines for oil customers. So if you looked at Energy & Transportation at their first half of '15, they were only down 6% versus the prior year. Second half of the year was down 27%, that is kind of how we thought it would play in, it's what we signalled at the beginning of the year, stronger first half, weaker second half and now we see kind of that level of business continuing on with the recip oil and gas out on into 2015. It [ph] being down 5% to 10% and Resource Industries down another 15% to 20%.","Now on Resource Industries the bad news is that it looks it's found another 15% to 20%, that's really a tough business in mining, very few orders. Many of our customers are in sort of challenged financial conditions. But what I would say is sales of new equipment in that number are quite low. You never want to say never about upside and downside risk, but there are so little new equipment in there, I think it's fair to say the downside risk is somewhat limited. In terms of profit per share, we put in a table here and this is the table that was in our financial release. There's a lot of moving parts, so I thought it would help to walk through it piece by piece.","So if you look at our outlook for 2016, all in profit per share we're looking at $3.50 and that includes restructuring costs and that includes pension changes that we are making. We're making a change in accounting principle, it relates to our defined benefit plans primarily. It's positive to our results about $0.50 a share and the way you want to think about this is we're moving from an accounting method that smoothes actuarial gains and losses from prior years into current year results. We're moving from that to a method that's kind of more mark-to-market and will be a closer representation of what our current year costs really are and that's favourable about $425 million in and of itself and that's about $0.50 a share.","We also have another $400 million or so of restructuring costs in our outlook and that's about $0.50. So all in excluding restructuring costs were at $4 a share, so that's the outlook for 2016 on sales and profit. In terms of profit, the negatives are lower sales as we go into 2016 from $47 billion down to the midpoint, would be $42 billion, so at a midpoint that's a $5 billion profit drop, offset by considerable cost reduction. A lot of that as a result of the restructuring actions that we started to put in place last September.","So with that I'll turn the floor over to Doug Oberhelman.","Doug Oberhelman","Okay. Good morning everyone and I do want to make a few key points as I look back on '15 and forward into '16. Mike said it was a very tough year, but when you think about everything that happened, the challenges, the chaos in sometime during the year with events around the world, a year ago today we were expecting $50 billion in sales, we ended up at $47 billion, that $3 billion is quite a drop, but we really only reduced our profit per share outside of restriction by $0.11. As Mike there's a lot involved in that, up and down, but basically I'm pretty pleased with cost management, the restructuring actions we took in the fourth quarter, actually they were more aggressive than we had planned and announced and we took about $100 million more because of it. But that will suit us up well for 2016, so our team really did a good job and it's tough to say but we're getting used to cycles here.","Our 2009 volume at $32 billion, we doubled the company in three years in 2012 we're down about 30% from that now and that will serve this team very well in the years and decades ahead as everyone [ph] go through these kind of cycles in a short dates. Secondly, operationally 2015 was one of our better years. One thing and I've talked about this before. One of the proxies I used for plant management is their safety record, and when I go to plants I look at - for that matter, I want to go to customers' job sites, it's the same thing. But if there's a safe environment, they tell me about it and their numbers are good, chances are we're going to see high quality, we're going to see engaged employees, and we're going to see a profitable plant. Safety for us hit a record level of - well, recordable injury frequency in 2015 at 0.6. which is really world-class we think for heavy manufacturing.","Our market position, fifth year in a row of improvement around the world and virtually across all markets for that matter and most all products. And I think that goes back to saying something about the quality of our product, the quality of our design, our Tier 4 implementation as well as our dealer distribution organization, which right now is very strong. Then finally Mike mentioned it, but I would point it out again. Our decremental operating profit of 20%, if you really look at that without restructuring, I think it's really 17% and while that agreement happened in the fourth quarter, but that's that we wanted to do. So very happy with that and again sets us up for '16, so well.","Our balance sheet is strong, we put some of the data in the release this morning. We saw a lot of free cash flow, about $5.2 billion in 2015, another great year. Certainly we'll see another positive cash flow year this year, more than enough to cover our dividend and our CapEx. I would say that we are scrubbing CapEx, very hard and taking a really close look at every line item, we'll get that number down below 15 and we're still working through it.","Finally our focus on use of cash as you know has been fairly well stated over the years, but at the moment it's our balance sheet, our credit rating and protecting our dividend. With the cash we have on the balance sheet, with the leverage we have today, which is the best it's ever been at this stage of a cycle, going back to many, many of our downturns, we feel pretty good about that, but that's really a high priority for us today is to protect that dividend and that balance sheet. We did a little conference call in November around Cat Financial. We really liked that business, it's strategic to us, we would not have the market position we have without Cat Financial and the loyalty with our customers.","Actually in 2015 they hit a very high market share number for what they financed. The quality of that asset portfolio is very good, past due has actually improved a little bit from 2014. Just to emphasize that we really at Cat Financial only use that captive finance company to finance Caterpillar product, yellow iron or yellow iron inside others products, where yellow iron is a big piece of it. We have not varied from that strategy. We won't vary from that strategy. It is so key and crucial to us in delivering our market performance around the world and it's a really well managed company and really helping us through the cycles as well.","Looking into 2016 tough market, I would expect bumps in the road all through the year, we've taken that outlook down to $42 billion, another drop of $5 billion, little over 10% reduction. About 30% off our peak in '12 and I expect to see, frankly, commodities of all stripes and all kinds and oil for that matter not to move too much. It can move up or down, we'll see what happens, but we're really going into this with an eyes wide open, realistic view of it. We're going to end up the year with what we went into within, and where we are in commodity markets and other economies as well. Brazil, Russia, some of the areas where really challenged, we're baking into this outlook, continued tough times in a lot of those markets as well. So I really am hoping that this is a very realistic look. We've got some restructuring - more restructuring coming to us that will help. We think we're about right size for right now, of course we've got some other restructuring that we'll be announcing as early as tomorrow, with another one - another round that will fulfil some of the things we talked about in September.","I also want to talk about inventory a little bit, we think we're pretty close and really not that excessive with inventory around the world. But we probably will see a slight some more here reduction in dealer inventory. We've actually been producing at factory rates less than retail sales for a while and we as a result seeing dealer inventory drop $1 billion and our own drop $2.5 billion. So we've really seen a drop here in the last year, which again sets up nicely into 2016.","Then a little bit more on restructuring, I think we are committed to that walk through number of 25 to 30 up and down. As I said we're 17 to 20 in 2015. We announced in September our goal was 4,000 to 5,000 positions eliminated. By the end of the year in fact, we were slightly over 5,000 on the 1st of January and with a few more to go, yet early in '16, which should fulfil that program and our cost reduction goals.","Finally and this is the one that's a good news, I feel really good about, I'm going to talk about it for a minute, that's our efforts around digital technology, innovation and R&D. We increased R&D slightly in 2015. We're going to hold it, at about that level, as long as we can in 2016 and I would just point out that we also did something similar to this in '09 and '10 at the depths of the recession. We cut R&D but we didn't cut it to the bone, that was the one thing we held onto as long as we could. Those efforts in research and development that we made at that time on new products have hit the marketplace in our Tier 4 interim and final products being introduced, the last of it this year. We have seen a substantial increase in the quality of the products, design of the products and acceptance in the marketplace. Not to mention fuel economies across the board.","Today we're in the same boat, post-year for with lots of powertrain development, all kinds of alternative proportion methods coming through, which will be coming out of products in '17, '18 and '19. We want to continue that because we've seen the benefits of that in market share, we'll see the benefits of that in the future and we're going to do all we can to hold that. So well that's a high number and subject to cut, talk if we have to and we will. We're doing all we can to preserve that. Then around the digital technology space, you've seen an awful lot of utterances from us last year, the formation of a joint venture with a key partner, closer ties with other existing and traditional partners as well. The digital transformation is incurring a reality and we are going to lead this in our industry.","While it's challenging and our cycle with portfolio, if we had a better cycle we'd probably spend more, we're doing all we can to extend our leadership in this area. What we are aiming at is quite a bit different than others. I would say we're aiming at the internet of Caterpillar things, so that when we think about what we're doing with digital technology, what we're doing with site preparation and technology, machine guidance technology, machine health technology, it's all about our installed base of the 3 million machines and engines. Rail, construction, mining the things we do.","We have no interest in going beyond that because we want to take care of our customers, as we have been doing for 90 years. We have the domain knowledge of what our customers use our machines to do. We have knowledge of our machines. Our idea is to make a ready platform, lots of sensors across our machines and other brands to make sure that our customer gets the most out of their construction equipment in his or her fleet. I suspect that in the next year or two, five [ph] this will be a tremendous and we'll be talking a lot more to you about it in our investor meetings and so on as we get there.","Just this month, we're commercializing our locomotive, internet technology that's led all of our segments and it's now ready to go. We're in the middle stages of taking that to construction equipment, we'll have some of that ready mid-year and a lot of it by the end of the year. But the idea here is really a lot of value creation for customers, reducing downtime and lowering owning and operating costs by predicting failures, by allowing them to take less passes across a parking lot for example. Better fuel economies and efficiencies as a result, all through this overwhelming amount of data that we can now receive, process and feedback to our customers, our dealers and even our factories in a way that we've never been able to do it before. We have a lot to say on this, there's been a lot written about it. I'm really happy where we are and our speed to market on this is un- Caterpillar like in terms of iron development. I'm quite happy about that, that's why we've gone to outside partner.","So Mike, I'll turn it back over to you with those comments.","Michael DeWalt","All right. Thanks, Doug. Paul, we're ready to open the floor for our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is coming from Jerry Revich. Jerry, please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Jerry Revich","Hi, good morning everyone. It's Goldman Sachs. I'm wondering if you could talk about your expectations for solar, just flesh that out for us, if you could Mike this year? Comment on cadence over the course of a year within the past month we've seen pipeline MLPs cut CapEx and wondering if you could just calibrate us and what you're seeing in the order book?","Michael DeWalt","Yeah, good question, Jerry, happy to do that. So as is almost usual, solar had a great fourth of 2015, we expected that and in fact they did. Backlog for solar was despite that big shipping quarter in the fourth quarter was about the same at year-end as it was at the end of the third quarter, so no deterioration in their backlog. In fact if you look at solar's total backlog it's about the same as it was at the end of '14. What's happened to their business is the oil piece of it has declined quite a bit, the natural gas piece of it is holding up quite nicely. We kind of signalled that we would have some reduction in solar, in third quarter we did the preliminary outlook. We said they would likely decline, but less than 10% and nothing has really changed there.","Jerry Revich","Then separately, Doug, the last point that you made, the Caterpillar Internet of Things, can you talk about your expectations in five years are we looking at a significant revenue and profit pool for your business? What kind of business model should we be thinking about for you folks to monetize all of the valuable fleet that you have in the field and the opportunity to monetize that data. How should we think about the business model?","Doug Oberhelman","It's not going to be a software charge-off system at all. We're going to measure it and the benefit to us will be in aftermarket parts, aftermarket service. In connection to the customer through the products that we sell and service and that's really where we're headed as opposed to a software for free basis, pretty simple. It's just it adjunct to what we're already doing in so many varieties [ph] today with aiming directly at our customers.","Michael DeWalt","Thanks, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Robert please mention your affiliation and pose your question.","Robert Wertheimer","Its Barclays and good morning everybody. I guess, a dual question on price and cost. You've had a little bit of lower pricing, although I think under your leadership Doug, you guys have been very, very competitive, gained a lot of share and not maybe margins with price [ph], so I get that. But you still had a little bit of a contraction price, so was there anything major going on with either currency or is it inventory flush or what's doing that? Are you able to continue to get cost back from your suppliers? Are you sort of ahead of the curve or does that continue to flow through into '17, the materials moves we've already seen?","MichaelDeWalt","Hey, Rob this is Mike, I'll start this out. I'm going to start a little bit with material costs. We've done actually very well over the last, I don't know three, four years on material cost. I think we in combination taken out over $1 billion. So over that timeframe and last year '15 was a good chunk of that. So it's been a combination of actually lower commodity prices have helped some. But all the work we've done on lean, resourcing, engineered value change, our investments in R&D, our partnerships with suppliers, that helped generated a pretty good chunk of that cost reduction as well. So if you relate that to our price realization, that was a net benefit for us in 2015. I mean, we had continued good material cost reduction and our pricing overall was pretty neutral. It was favourable in the first half of the year, unfavorable in the second half.","As we look ahead to 2016, that will probably shift down a little bit. I think given where commodity prices are right now we're not expecting as much benefit because we don't see another big leg down. So the material cost reduction that we have [indiscernible] on the things that we do to get it. By the same token price realization is tougher, and I think in large part or a chunk of what's going on, particularly in construction is and we've had a stronger dollar over the course of the past year. There are translation effects of that that happen immediately. We're selling in euros in Europe and that changes, but the competitive effects in the U.S. and in countries where say we in Komatsu are competing against each other whether it'd be Latin America or Europe. I think the impact of the stronger dollar is starting to bite a little bit.","Another thing that's hurt us on price a bit in particularly the fourth quarter and this might be a little bit hard to follow. But actually where we're selling product matters a bit. We have different price levels in different parts of the world. I would tell you if you look at construction in the fourth quarter, there was a large decline in Latin America like 49% I think in CI. We tend to have better price realization there than we do in some other parts of the world. And so that hurt the overall kind of average price in the quarter as well. So I guess, bottom line, stronger dollar, I think very competitive environment with volumes lower. A little bit of negative geography for us, the flipside of that is still continued good work on material costs.","Doug Oberhelman","Just to add a little philosophy here. You alluded to what we've tried to do over the last few years and you're exactly right, that's raised our market share. We've had, - we've done well with that. That one will change. This business is run field population and as long as that field population is building, it allows our dealers to really survive in tough times like these and thrive in good times and that's going to continue. But we have baked a little bit more in as Mike said for price. We've got the dollar situation, we've got excess capacity with competitors all over the place and we think we can juggle that in a way where we can continue to move our market position up, while kind of guarding the margin as well, but it's a balance. It's the same balance we've been working on the last five or six years.","Robert Wertheimer","Thank you, Doug.","Doug Oberhelman","Thanks Rob.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question is coming from Joel Tiss. Please mention your affiliation and pose your question.","Joel Tiss","I just wonder if you can help us a little bit with some first half, second half color especially in E&T, you're going to have tough comps, obviously in the first half of the year. Can you give us any idea like revenue decline first half versus second half or anything to help us figure that out?","MichaelDeWalt","Yeah, Joel and I've mentioned and I've said a lot earlier, but if we look back at '15 we had a lot more decline in the second half of the year than the first half of the year and that's because the first half of last year was helped by the size of the backlog, particularly around drilling and well servicing, that's pretty well gone now. So I think it's safe to say that year-over-year in that decline that we're expecting for Energy & Transportation the 10 to 15, it will probably more than that in the first half and less than that in the second half. We don't really do the quarterly breakdown, but your sentiment what your thinking is actually correct? Year-over-year a lot tougher in the first half than the second half. I know that wasn't detailed, but --","Joel Tiss","Yeah, but basically I get between the lines you're saying that business is expected to be pretty much flat for the year, so we can just figure out what that means for you now?","MichaelDeWalt","No. Down 10 to 15, but probably down more than that in the first half and probably less than half in the second half.","Joel Tiss","Any signs of any aftermarket business stabilizing, that's usually the early warning signs that were deep enough into a downturn that things are starting to stabilize?","MichaelDeWalt","Well you know, on a percentage and even dollar basis the change and after-market has gone down, no doubt about that over the last couple of years. But the decline is much less than what's happened in new equipment. The fourth quarter was down, again so right white I would say there's no signs that that's really kicking up. But the longer customers work existing machines and don't replace as long as the output tends to holdup at some point here that will need to happen, so far hasn't.","Joel Tiss","Okay. Thank you.","MichaelDeWalt","Thanks, Joel.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Ross Gilardi. Ross please mention your affiliation and pose your question.","Ross Gilardi","Yeah, good morning, thanks guys. Bank of America. So Mike I believe present your solution impose your question in 20 think I said think America. So Mike I believe you guys normally have your annual impairment test in the fourth quarter. It doesn't look like you've booked any impairments. Even though you've had a [indiscernible] competitor just write off 50% of its book value. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about that. I mean, you're speaking very candidly about all the pressures in the mining business that you've now been feeling for four years in a row. So can you talk about the rationale for not writing down a big portion of goodwill on the back of his latest test?","MichaelDeWalt","Yeah I can do that. So first the current mining business is weak. There's no doubt about that. Second what I would tell you is we just in the fourth quarter to your point. We completed an impairment test with what we believe is a pretty realistic forecast going forward and we had no impairment. If there's an event that causes us or triggers us to do it again before the next fourth quarter, we'll do that. But I mean we did the math, there's no impairment. But I think one thing you need to remember about this business is it's highly cyclical. You know where the business is at today, at least from our piece of it. The sales of equipment to that industry. We're well below a replacement level, it has to return and to at least a replacement level over time. You do an impairment test and that's a long-term view of what's going to happen. It's not based on what's going to happen next year. And we've done it consistent with the way we have. We didn't been have an impairment, I don't know what else to say about that. I'm not on the inside and our competitors, accounting department, so it's hard for me to comment on what they did.","Ross Gilardi","And then Doug, I just had kind of a bigger picture question. I mean, in the last couple of days we have seen Zoomlion bidding for Terex publicly. And while they might not be a huge direct competitor of Caterpillar's, does the prospect of a big Chinese OEM buying a listed U.S. company, potentially set a precedent that concerns Caterpillar?","Doug Oberhelman","We saw a signing by Putzmeister, I don't know three or four years ago and become really a dominant player in - maybe deep down player in concrete pumping. Crane business, yes, still a pretty broad. I would guess we're going to see more Chinese investment in United States and all kinds of things, we'll see how this sorts out if it actually closes up. But it wouldn't surprise me to see some of that. Yeah I expect that's probably a strategy, if I were sitting over there in China, I'd be looking at some of this also. So I would expect to see some of that. I don't think it's going to be an overwhelming wave of things. But certainly they're growing and we've always said we'll see one, two or three emerging Chinese competitors of some kind and maybe that's a move like that around our industry, not certainly, not in it. That we don't really play too much against any more. Although, Terex is a good supplier though the Genie brand to our dealers.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","David Raso","Evercore ISI. I was wondering if you can just help us a bit with the cadence of the earnings for '16. Just given the moving parts around the restructuring savings, can you give us some pace on that? Even the accounting change, is it simply a linear day one, and just run it out per quarter, just for some sense of the cadence exiting '16?","Doug Oberhelman","Yeah, David, excellent question. So on the pension that just plays into what the annual cost is and that will be spread evenly essentially over the course of the year. In terms of the restructuring, most of the - at least a short-term benefit that we were expecting for 2016, its a result of heads out and that is as Doug said on target a little ahead of on target. So the vast majority of that will and I mean, what we gave you was a full-year number, so the vast majority of that has already happened as of the first in the year. So that should be pretty good to divide by four, probably not quite that. There's a bit more still to happen, but probably not massively of dividing by four because a lot of the actions are effective at the end of the year, this year.","David Raso","Well, that's what I'm trying to think about with some of those savings upfront and the pension accounting help upfront. When you look at the $4 number ex restructuring, any help at all on how you think about the cadence and through the year?","Doug Oberhelman","Yeah, if you just look at our last couple of quarters, we've been right around $11 billion. Now the first and second quarter of '15 were higher, but again that was before some of the declines that we're expecting like oil and gas. So I think as we've kind of gone down for oil and gas, now that that's out of the backlog. I think if you look at the kind of sales cadence for next year, it probably won't be massively off, what a normal distribution is for us. So probably a little bit lower in the first quarter, a little bit higher in the fourth and second quarters and a little bit lower in the third quarter. From a profit standpoint, our first quarter will have a little bit below average sales, likely it's a middle of winter, not really the selling season. So probably a little weaker than average, so that will impact profit to the downside a little bit. The upside of that is the first quarter is usually a pretty good of cost quarter, so that usually helps the first quarter a little bit. So we're not actually providing guidance but for the quarter. But all in all as you do your modelling I would think about probably first quarter down a little bit from average profit, probably not massively far off it.","David Raso","Okay. And last question Doug, if you spoke to commodity prices, you're not assuming much recovery - the end-market on much recovery. But how are you managing for '17, saying say it another way. If commodities are at the end of this year where they are today, thinking through the inventory reduction you're targeting $1 billion at dealers. Just how should we think about 2017, if commodities are at the end of the year where they are today? I mean, take us through your thoughts on replacement demand, inventory, for the dealer inventory. I mean, we went up $4.5 billion, $5 billion coming out of the great recession. In the last three years we've taken $5 billion out. So work I can't say the inventory is down a lot over the last six years. We kind of went up, we're back down. Is taking $1 billion out enough and just again, just try to set the stage a little bit, how you're managing for '17?","Doug Oberhelman","Well, right now it's all hands on deck for '16 and hopefully we can get that done. I would say around inventory and inventory turnover as we have been implementing lean in all of our initiatives around our Cat production system. I feel - that fact that we've taken 30% off the top line and inventory down about the same amount or so, just to stay even with that in a falling cycle is pretty darn good. Once we get stable, at a bottom to slightly rising turn, whatever that is and a stable production schedule, I suspect our inventory turnover is going to be very, very acceptable in order to help us. That's about as far as I would go with that, David. Because I don't know if oil or commodities where they'll be a year from now and I really don't want to think about that, other than inventory turnover to efficiency in the plants, our variable margins, that's what's going to get us through that.","David Raso","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Brad Halverson","David it's Brad. Maybe one comment around how we're approaching this relative to priorities. So we did talk a lot about our actions up until September, but we had taken significant restructuring actions to that point. But again in June really 2015, we started a process internally that led to our September restructuring effort. By and large, the cost reduction we're talking about in period cost had protected R&D and our digital spend and other priorities, so we've seen a significant reduction in a lot of the support areas in terms of consolidation and efficiency. I bring this up because sometimes we get the question, what are you going to do if sales continue to drop? I can tell you that we're continuing to work that plan. We understand and got committed to our decremental pull-throughs and so if sales do drop, we may have to cut those some, but we have other restructuring efforts that we're continuing to look at and we'll be prepared and take action on those.","David Raso","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. Credit Suisse. I guess two questions; one, Doug you addressed a lot of, I guess, your confidence level with the balance sheet and protecting the dividend. But can you give any color on how you think about sort of cash flow in 2016. If you look at over the past few years, working capital has been a big source. I guess, the concern is that sort of running out. If earnings are down in '17 that the balance sheet is sort of at risk, so your thoughts on that? Then Mike, I guess, if you - you gave some - a lot of help on the top line, I'm just trying to think about any color you're giving on margins by segment. As I assume resource is still not profitable and in particular E&T, how to think about margins as we exit the year, because I think that's a concern as we approach '17 with still lot rolling off? Thanks.","Doug Oberhelman","That's a lot there. I'll start with the cash flow. We'll have reasonably good cash flow in '16 at the outlook levels. We'll cover our CapEx again, we're going to work hard to get that number down, we'll cover our dividend and I suspect with positive cash flow above that. So we ought to be able to maintain our balance sheet about where it is, if not strengthen a bit more this year. Again, I'm not going to into '17 too much, but the same philosophy would hold in terms of the priorities of maintaining that. And in fact maybe if we have to get to a point in '16 or '17 to use the strength of the balance sheet to protect the dividend, we will.","Brad Halverson","I've commented before about that and I think '16 at the outlook numbers were, we feel pretty good about in terms of cash flow et cetera, Mike you can handle the other one.","MichaelDeWalt","Yeah, on, just a little bit on by segment. We did talk a lot about the sales change and not much about the profit change by segment. So here is what I would say around that. So let's just backtrack a little bit and look at 2015. What happened in 2015 to decrementals. Construction had an awesome year, decrementals and construction were 10%, so their sales were down about $2.8 billion, their profit was down less than 300. And that was despite this legal charge that they got into year. So very good year on managing decrementals. Resource Industries, their decrementals were 36% and I think that was a little over our target range and partly because despite sales going down, we spent more there on R&D. I mean, it's a business that we think will be good for the long-term and we needed to spend investment money in R&D there and in fact we did.","Energy & Transportation, they had decrementals of 24%, which I think given the mix of what was down for them. If you look at how much of their business was down because of oil and gas, which tended to be an above average margin business, 24% I think for them is pretty good. In total for the Company and again this is excluding restructuring, we had decrementals of about 20%. That's kind of what we've got baked into next year. I won't comment so - I mean, overall 20%. I won't comment so much on ROS by segment. I mean, like resource industries for example, they are at or below their breakeven point right now. So the ROS number I think is probably less meaningful than the decremental. I think throughout the Company we're working on delivering decent decrementals and a big cost reduction that we have planned for next year, both on material cost or variable cost in total and the big restructuring should help all the segments. So I'm not going to give ROS guidance, but I would say that certainly as a Company and I don't think any of our segments would be big outliers here. We'll be at a better than our, kind of our target decrementals.","Jamie Cook","Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","MichaelDeWalt","Alrighty. I think we have time for one more.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. My first question is just a little bit more big picture. Given the strength of the dollar and the week emerging market economic activity that we're seeing around or maybe specifically Canada and Latin American. Is there any risks that we start to see equipment things either used or unused [ph] kind of flowing back into the U.S. and then thus putting incremental pressure on new equipment sales in the U.S.","Doug Oberhelman","Good morning, Ann. Actually our EPA regulations have sort of helped that to some degree because of the requirements of low sulphur fuel on machines that are produced in this country and the EPA emissions level. So there may be some of that and we're worried about that for a number of years. I think you're probably also alluding to the great market that we said, we had tended to see in times past where there is currencies that are a little bit out of the line. I think the emissions thing between us and Europe and Japan for the most part and Canada will be involved with that, there may be some flow from Canada here. But Mexico is not in that, Latin America, I think will probably have some amelioration what we've seen in historical levels of that. But something we would keep an eye on.","Ann Duignan","Okay. Thank you, I appreciate that. Then on the smoothing of the pension plan and going to mark-to-market, I mean, there's a reason why we smoothed in the first place in order to reduce volatility. Are you concerned that moving to mark-to-market might end up adding to your earnings volatility through the course of the coming years?","MichaelDeWalt","Ann this is Mike, a couple of things. Actually I can't remember the year, several years ago we made a change to sunset or our kind of main defined benefit plans at the end of 2019. Along the way we've been on a path to derisk the asset, the fund balance. We've moved to more fixed income rather than equity and that will likely continue. It's going to sunset again at the end of 2019. That doesn't completely take out volatility, but I think the combination of, we stopped adding people to that plan a long time ago. People in that plan are retiring, we're not adding people to it. It will stop at the end of '19 with shift towards more fixed income, probably be what we're thinking it would reduce the volatility. Somewhat, certainly won't take it away, wouldn't suggest that at all.","But as more companies have moved to this method, I think when they have a year-end adjustment for just like we will at the end of this year. I think the market has done a decent job of understanding what's going on and that it is - what it is for what it is. So I don't think it'll - I mean, our view anyway is that it wouldn't impact so much how people are viewing us. If there's a year-end adjustment and we like the change because it better matches what's actually happening from an expense standpoint rather than spreading it over years. So in the current year for example and I said this before, this is not a big unique OTO item that's happening in the year. It's taking out losses from prior years that were masking operating results in the current year. That's our view any way.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I appreciate. I know we're out of time.

At this time, all lines have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.","Mike DeWalt","Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I am Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations. And I am pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Dough Oberhelman; and Group President and CFO, Ed Rapp with me on the call today.","Now, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., and any use, or recording, or transmission of any portion of this call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar, is strictly prohibited. If you would like a copy of today\u2019s call transcript, we\u2019ll be posting it in the Investor Section of our Caterpillar.com website, and it\u2019ll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.","This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. The discussion of some of those factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could make actual results differ materially from our projections, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1-A, Risk Factors, of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC back on February 21 of this year, and also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release.","In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can also be found in this morning\u2019s financial release, and that will again be posted on our website at Caterpillar.com.","Okay. To start-off this morning, I'll do a few bullet points that summarize this morning\u2019s release. It was an all time record sales quarter, in fact the best of the 87-year history of Caterpillar, and up 22% from the second quarter last year. A little over 12% of that was organic growth, and a little under 10% from our acquisitions.","Sales and revenues rose about 9% sequentially from the first to the second quarters. It was a great quarter for profit, and also an all-time record at $2.54 a share, and operating profit was over 15% in sales and revenues. We had very good incremental operating profit pull through at 44% excluding the impact of our acquisitions.","We did however make a downward revision of $2 billion to the top-end of our sales and revenues outlook range. About $1 billion was a result of negative currency translation and about $1 billion because of weaker world economic growth that we previously expected. We did not change the bottom-end of the range, so that means the sales and revenues at the midpoint are down about $1 billion. And we increased our full-year 2012 profit outlook from $9.50 to $9.60 at the middle of the sales and revenues range.","Okay, those were the high level points, I\u2019ll add a little more color then Doug and Ed and I will take your questions, and I\u2019ll start with sales. Again, sales and revenues up 22%, excluding Bucyrus and MWM acquisitions, which we didn\u2019t own last year. Organic growth again a little more than 12%.","The largest increase was in our Resource Industries segment, which is primarily mining. Sales were up 68% from a year ago, about 37% from the acquisition of Bucyrus and about 31% organic growth. Sales were up in all geographic regions both with and without Bucyrus.","Our Power System segment was up 12% and that was 8% organic growth and about 4% from our acquisition of MWM. The strongest growth was in North America and the strongest industries were petroleum and rail.","Our Construction Industries segment was up 8% and that increase was essentially all volume with negative currency impacts about offsetting positive price realization. Construction sales were up in North America, about flat in Europe, Africa, Middle East and that\u2019s where most of the negative currency impacts were. Latin America was down 3%, and Asia-Pacific was off 11%. And of that 11% decline in Asia-Pacific, more than all of that was China.","Speaking of China, over the past quarter, it\u2019s been very topical; what\u2019s happening there, what are we doing about it, and when do we think it will get better? And with most of the sales in China relating to construction, this is a good place to address it. So, in terms of what\u2019s happening there, the construction equipment industry remains very weak and it really hasn\u2019t shown much in the way of signs of improvement yet. In addition to the weak demand, there is still quite a bit of inventory available on the ground in China.","Now, while the industry is still pretty weak, it did turned down at about this time last year. So we are at about the point where the comparables are starting to get easier. So, on a year-over-year basis, the numbers will likely start looking better than the first half of 2012, even though the industry isn\u2019t seeing much improvement yet.","So, the question is, what are we doing about it? And the answer is, we\u2019re actually doing quite a bit. First, we\u2019re working with dealers to actually sell more products. Over the past couple of months, we took new programs in place to get that done. And we expect to start seeing results of those programs in the third quarter and expect to get more of the available market.","Second, we and our dealers are actively addressing inventory. During the second quarter, Cat dealers in China reduced machine inventories and that\u2019s a good thing. However, with weak end-user demand and dealers cutting inventory, it\u2019s resulted in a very low level of shipments from us to dealers, and that make it tougher to reduce inventory.","We\u2019ve already lowered production in China and expect to reduce it even more in the third quarter. That along with the higher level of exports from China to other parts of the world should help lower inventory there. However, because the sales volume levels in China haven\u2019t begun to improve much, we expect it will take a couple of more quarters to get inventory levels in China where we like them to be.","While we\u2019re actively working to get inventory down in China, we\u2019re trying to keep a balanced view. One of the few certainties in this business is that markets go down and then markets go back up. In China, we\u2019re encouraged by the recent actions the government is taking to improve economic growth. They\u2019ve cut interest rates, they\u2019ve lowered bank reserve-requirements, and we expect they\u2019ll increase infrastructure spending later this year. So we do need to be a little bit careful.","The construction industry in China had a history of turning quickly. And when it does, we do need to be prepared. We are actively working the plan to lower inventory there, but we don\u2019t want to go to the other extreme and take it down to a point below where we\u2019d have difficulty reacting when improvement does inevitably come.","So, bottom line, we think there is a good chance that signs of better economic growth in China will start later in 2012, and well, that\u2019s our view. Our 2012 sales and revenues outlook does not rely on any material improvement in China sales this year. Okay, that\u2019s enough on China, construction and sales, let\u2019s shift to profit.","And it\u2019s a great story to talk about. It was a great quarter, and in fact again $2.54 a share, our best quarter ever with operating margin just over 15% of sales and revenues. That was also one of our best performances ever.","Cost control was very good. Material costs were about flat, freight cost were not an issue, variable labor productivity more than offset, labor cost inflation, and period cost control was very good, with period cost increasing at well less than half the rate of the sales increase. All in all, a very well executed quarter.","However, on the negative side there was a tax rate. We increased our estimated annual tax rate from 30% for the full year to 30.5% mostly related to the geographic mix of where our profits are earned from a tax perspective. That\u2019s means that after tax profit in the second quarter was about $24 million lower than it would have been had we not made a change to the estimated tax rate.","Okay. That\u2019s our quick review of the second quarter results; let\u2019s move on for a moment to the outlook. Now, as a starting point, remember our previous outlook was a sales and revenues range of $68 billion to $72 billion and profit of about $950 million at the midpoint of that range. This morning, we did tighten up the sales and revenues range by lowering the top-end from $72 billion to $70 billion. Now we first introduced that $68 billion to $72 billion range at the end of January with our year-end 2011 financial release and we held it steady last quarter in April when we released our first quarter.","This morning\u2019s $2 billion decline at the top-end of the range was a result of two things: negative currency translation and weaker global economic expectations than we had previously thought. The currency impact as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar, its translation, our sales that are denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translating into fewer U.S. dollars and certainly the most significant negative impact is in the Europe.","Now, we did not change the bottom-end of the range and as a result the midpoint is down $1 billion. And at the midpoint of that new range that $68 billion to $70 billion sales and revenues range, we expect profit to be about $9.60 a share. That\u2019s up $0.10 from $9.50 a share to midpoint of the $68 billion to $72 billion sales range that we previously had.","A few points about the outlook, profit is higher despite the increase in the estimated annual tax rate. Operational execution has been very strong and we expect that that will result in better profit despite the tax increase.","Currency while impacting sales has had little impact on the profit movement from $9.50 to $9.60. Our global manufacturing footprint and broad cost base provides an offset to the impacts from sales. And on that point, I frequently read media commentary about Caterpillar when exchange rates moved, and it\u2019s frequently off base.","And because of that, I think it\u2019s worth making this point one more time. We work hard over the past 30 years to get a better balance on currency exposure and because of that, we are in a much better currency position than we were historically. Rates can move and do move sales, but when they do, the cost impact is usually in the opposite direction and mitigates the overall profit impact.","So in summary, we had a great second quarter. We are a little more cautious of the top-end of our sales and revenues outlook and we\u2019ve raised the profit guidance to about $9.60 at the middle of the sales and revenues range.","Another point before we move on to the Q&A, and that\u2019s the level of uncertainty in the world economy. It\u2019s hard to pick up a newspaper today and not read about troubles in Europe with Greece, Spain and Italy. They\u2019re annexed with growth rates in GB and China. There is concern about political polarization in the U.S. and what will happen at the end of the year with the fiscal and tax cliff. But those are the facts of life that we\u2019re all dealing with today, and there is no doubt that there have been a negative for business and consumer confidence. We see it, and we understand that some of these issues like Europe\u2019s debt problems could take a while to fix.","That said, we expect that over the next couple of quarters that some of those clouds will clear a bit and we can start forming a little bit better picture of 2013. And while none of us know at this point, what those outcomes will be, we do know that the U.S. elections will be over in the fall, and we think chances are good, there will be a resolution to the fiscal cliff.","The leadership changes in China will also happen later this year. and after another quarter or two, we\u2019ll get a better sense of the effectiveness of the easing measures that Chinese have already taken and any additional measures they may take to improve growth.","We know that in Brazil, they\u2019ve started easing late in 2011, and we are seeing some improvement in our business there today, and we expect that improvement to continue to unfold as we go through the rest of this year. We also do think that Brazil\u2019s preparations for the World Cup and the next Olympics will be positive for them moving forward.","Bottom line, we believe that some of the uncertainty that\u2019s facing the world economy today will at least be a little less cloudy by the time we get to the end of 2012. and as a result of numerous monetary easing actions that have been taken around the world, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that the world economy in 2013 will be better than in 2012.","One last comment and then we\u2019ll start the Q&A. and as a seasonality reminder, we have numerous vacation shutdowns around the world built into our third quarter that's normal that happens every year. and as a result, the third quarter is usually a weaker, seasonally, a sales quarter. The fourth quarter is usually a seasonally high quarter for sales. So for those of you that are trying to model our quarterly results, please take that into consideration. The third quarter is usually the weaker quarter of the second half.","So that\u2019s a review of our results. and with that, we are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your questions.","Jerry D. Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning, it\u2019s Goldman Sachs. Mike, can you tell us on how you're thinking about pricing heading into the back half of the year compared to the price realization we saw this quarter, and also comment on where you expect to see company and dealer inventories at year-end?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, I'll start with pricing. We've actually done better on pricing through the first half of the year than we expected it. It's really held up pretty well. Earlier in the year, we'd expected that we would get maybe 1% to 1.5% price for the full year. We\u2019re at probably between 2.5% and 3% right now through the first half.","We think it will probably go down a little bit in the second half that's what\u2019s baked into our guidance, we\u2019ll probably end up the year somewhere around 2%. Remember one of the points I mentioned was, we\u2019re working with dealers for example to sell more product in China, so there will be certain merchandising programs, for example related to that. So, I think a lot better year than we thought, it was going to be even including the economic impacts that you see today, but probably a little less in the second half than the first half.","In terms of dealer inventory, we did have a little bit of an increase in the second quarter more than all of that was mining. Now, when you look at dealer inventory for mining, you have to be a little careful, but it\u2019s not a case where dealers are loading up 400 ton trucks on their vault and hoping for a customer. It\u2019s a case where we pass title to them and then they have to get the product to their customer. They have to get it assembled and commissioned. So usually when our shipments go up like they did in the second quarter versus the first, the pipeline for mining inventory increases a bit and that\u2019s just a function of us shipping more through dealers to customers.","In terms of our inventory, we did have a bit of an increase, about 800 million in the second quarter. And there were four reasons for that; one, and I\u2019ll start from the smallest to the largest, in-transit inventory that\u2019s basically where we sold the product \u2013 it wasn\u2019t sold. We have a product that\u2019s been shift, but it\u2019s an export, it\u2019s on the high fees essentially and it\u2019s best in for customer, but we haven\u2019t passed title yet.","When our shipments and exports go up in-transit inventory, usually goes up. We had a 9% increase in sales between the first and second quarters and in-transit went up a bit. That\u2019s to be expected based on the sales increase. About 20% of the increase in the second quarter was components, working process, after market parts, and that\u2019s very related to sales. And again, we had a 9% increase in sales from first to second quarter.","20% of the inventory increase was from the acquisition of Siwei and Bucyrus. Siwei was an acquisition and Bucyrus inventory went up in the quarter and again that\u2019s not very surprising. We have businesses like Solar, like Bucyrus where they have seasonably big four quarters, they build a bit of inventory all year along, they have a big fourth quarter that usually goes down. And again, Siwei contributed about $100 million of the increase, not just an acquisition.","About half of the increase was finished goods and more than half of that was on our Excavator division in China. And I tried to cover this a little bit in the release this morning. It\u2019s a case where we are cutting production there, where more declines are going to come in the third quarter, but dealers are cutting inventory there as well. And if you start with a slow market and dealers reducing inventory, now there are not a lot of shipments going on from our factories to dealers then. So it\u2019s pretty hard to take inventory down.","So even with the reduction in production that we had in the third quarter, it wasn\u2019t quite enough yet to offset the impacts of a really slow market. So we are going to take it down a little bit more in the third quarter, we are exporting a higher percentage of the business in China, outside of China. So that should help there.","Edward J. Rapp","Hi, Jerry, this is Ed. The thing I would add on Cat inventory looking for the balance of the year, between now and year end, I\u2019d be disappointed if we didn\u2019t take $1 billion, at least $1 billion out of inventory. But we\u2019re also trying to be very thoughtful in terms of how we manage the full supply chain. If you think about what the supply chain has done and with $32 billion in \u201909, your midpoint of the outlook $69 billion and if you look at the basic outlook that says, there is some drivers out there, that says 2013 could be positive versus 2012. We want to be very thoughtful about how we take that inventory down, but we are now in the end of the year, getting $1 billion out is something we ought to be able to do.","Jerry D. Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Appreciate the color. And I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about how much visibility you have in your gas compression business and whether that business can continue to outpace the slowdown we\u2019re seeing in U.S. pressure pumping and in electric power, can you just on which regions are driving the weakness that we saw year-to-date and what you expect to heading to the back half? Thanks.","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, I mean, we don\u2019t break our petroleum business out in quite that much detail, but what I would tell you is the largest sort of application segment for oil and gas business is gas compression. So contrary to popular belief, it\u2019s not drilling and fracking, it\u2019s gas compression. So the more gas you have, the more wells you drill, the higher consumption of gas goes, the more need that you have for gas compression, so that business is actually doing quite well and looking up.","We do a lot of gas compression with Solar, and with Solar, we have a very good long-term visibility. So I\u2019d say oil and gas \u2013 your point about fracking is right. Fracking is slowing down, but gas compression is doing very well. So our general view of the oil and gas industry is actually pretty good right now. Jerry, we\u2019re going to have to move on to the next person in line. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation, then post your question.","David M. Raso \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","Hi, ISI. I\u2019m just trying to look at the inventory guidance. Ed, you just mentioned $1 billion coming out ideally by the end of the year. That would still imply the next couple of quarters that inventory will be growing faster than sales year-over-year. So just coming off the last five quarters of inventory still growing faster than sales, I\u2019m just trying to a) just understand why we continue to grow inventories faster than sales or b) is the answer and everybody can have their own macro view, are you guys in fact confident, 2013 is an up year to continue to grow inventory at this rate?","Edward J. Rapp","David, two things; first of all on inventory growing faster, I mean, if you really look at our guidance in terms of mid point of the outlook, we had sales in second half actually slightly up versus first half. And so you\u2019ve got a slight increase in sales and a lower inventory level. So you don\u2019t have inventory growing at a faster pace than sales.","And then your second point is, is far a little bit as well. It is my kind of walk around the world and you look at what 2013 should look like versus 2012. I can\u2019t imagine the degree of uncertainty we have in the U.S. so that we don\u2019t have greater clarity in \u201913. I can\u2019t imagine what the steps that China has taken in terms of monetary policy, pay cuts, reserve-requirement cuts, you don\u2019t see a better 2013 than 2012. I can\u2019t imagine with all the moves that Brazil has taken as well as the upcoming of the World Cup, the Olympics; you don\u2019t see a \u201913 better than \u201912.","So part of our thinking is making sure we are very thoughtful across the supply chain. The other one to keep in mind and I think second quarter really demonstrated it, there are also some benefits to the inventory position we have, our point of use availability, our quality, our delivery performance, our pull through, we are all very, very strong. And so I do think there is some benefits as to how we worked with our supply base to ramp up and I think you are seeing it in some of those operating metrics.","David M. Raso \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","And I appreciate the math sequentially, but I was speaking about year-over-year and the math is, you are still planning on inventory growing faster than sales year-over-year and obliviously, it sets up a little more risk on how much retail you need in \u201913 to continue to grow your production. So I guess, end of the day, I mean obviously you will give 13 top line guidance I assume Mike will give it on October, but the way you are handling the CapEx for the rest of the year essentially no cut, the way you are guiding the inventory I guess base case we have to be thinking, you\u2019re thinking \u201913 and up year, otherwise you would be taking a bigger cut through your inventory and even maybe even in the CapEx?","Edward J. Rapp","","And David, that\u2019s why we try to give you some color as to why we saw \u201913 being better. The other one to keep in mind on the CapEx is that in spite of the numbers that we reported today, which are an all-time record on both sales and profit, keep in mind that our traditionally strong markets U.S., Europe, and if you go back in history even Japan, are in the neighborhood of 40% off prior updates. And if at some point in time, those markets are going to turn. And when they turn, we want to be ready. And those places where we\u2019re taking and slowing down some of that CapEx, China being one example. But we\u2019re going through a business-by-business, industry-by-industry really looking at what the long-term prospects are going to be.","Mike DeWalt","","Okay, David, I\u2019m just going to add one more comment in there\u2026","David M. Raso \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","Sure.","Mike DeWalt","\u2026on the year-over-year. That is you almost have to look at it by the type of inventory that we\u2019re talking about. we\u2019ve increased parts inventory for example faster than sales. Part of the reason for that is we\u2019re putting additional Bucyrus inventory into the system. We\u2019re doing that to increase delivery performance there. That was a \u2013 that\u2019s the key part of driving higher part sales and profit out of Bucyrus. Now if you look at our actual production inventory, it\u2019s performed a lot closer to sales. if you look at the PDC that's where we\u2019re holding finished inventory. on purpose, we call it lane one inventory, that\u2019s up $1 billion or actually a little bit more than $1 billion year-over-year. That\u2019s very purposeful, I mean the problem was, a year-ago we didn\u2019t have enough capacity in place to get it where we need it. So we\u2019ve added more than $1 billion to PDC inventory on purpose, that was all a part of the plan, and we\u2019ve been able to do that really over the last six to nine months as productions come on stream.","Mike DeWalt","So, it\u2019s not just that simple, how much did sales go up, how much is inventory going up? And then we also had acquisitions. roughly, half of the FIFO inventory increases, Bucyrus, MWM and Siwei, just acquisitions.","David M. Raso \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate the color Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Barclays. Good morning guys, nice quarter. If I could ask you about backlog, Mike, I know you\u2019ve talked about in the past, you didn\u2019t kind of rue the day when it would go down. I think we all expected it to go down sequentially here. But how do you look at the backlog decline in terms of mining, and with your comments in the release about mining, customers extending investment over the next few years. How is it affecting your business now, and if mining CapEx is down significantly can you grow your business?","Mike DeWalt","","Couple of things, one, say how they are affecting our business now. Well, organic sales were up 31% in mining in the quarter. If you look at our year-over-year backlog, how well we do it on backlog versus year ago, it\u2019s up 11% not down. If you look at the change from the end of the first quarter, I mean there are a couple of things that are definitely going on there, one and this particularly effects construction, we took quite a few products off managed distribution. We've been on a situation for the last couple of years where we couldn't supply enough, and we had dealers on managed distribution for quite a few products. We've been adding production capability over the last couple of years, that situation, delivery times has improved a lot, and when that happens it's almost like clock work dealers take \u2013 they don't have to be quite so cautious, and because we can deliver quicker. So that was definitely a factor for construction.","On mining, customers did \u2013 we shift more than we took in new orders and the backlog did go down. But you almost have to look out in perspective. I mean we were getting very large orders, really over the past couple of years, and we\u2019re increasing every quarter. And it\u2019s a function of \u2013 we\u2019ve been putting in more capacity to deal with that. I mean we wanted for long time to get the order book for mining to a more reasonable level, delivery times for customers to a better level. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been putting capacity in place to do that.","That said, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace today, customers are \u2013 just like my comments in the opening, we\u2019re all trying to get a better picture in terms of what\u2019s going on economically. Central bankers have done quite a bit, but that takes a while to actually materialize in the economy.","And I think people are taking a little bit of wait and see to see how 2013 is going to shape up, and I think orders reflect that. That said, mining order book is quire long, we have very good visibility into 2013. For a lot of the big trucks, we\u2019re still taking orders into \u201914. So it\u2019s not as though, all of a sudden the backlog is dried up and we don\u2019t have any visibility.","Andrew Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital","","That\u2019s helpful, Mike. And if I could shift gears for a second, I mean in the first of the year you\u2019ve done almost 15% margins; in the second half of the year, if you look at the implied guidance, you would do much lower margins. You talked about lower production in China, incentive comp is going up, I mean we see all the things that are in the release. But the question I have is, is this some conservatism in the guidance?","Mike DeWalt","","Well, what I\u2019d tell you is this, many of the comments that we\u2019ve actually made here today more in the release, price realization is probably not going to be quite as strong in the back half of the year. Seasonally, the fourth quarter is usually a higher cost order. So those things will certainly impact the second half of the year.","But you\u2019re right, the first half\u2019s execution, has been very, very good. So I think our outlook is, I mean we raised the outlook today from $9.50 to $9.60 on midpoint of the sales range that went down $1 billion and we\u2019re looking at a higher tax rate. So I think actually the profit story for the rest of the year is pretty positive.","Andrew Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks. Appreciate it guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Henry Kirn. Please announce your affiliation, then post your question.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning guys, it\u2019s UBS.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","","Hey, Henry.","Edward J. Rapp","Hi, Henry.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","In the release, you called out the dealer rental inventory results. How much opportunity is there to refresh the fleets, and if we went through a pause, do you think the dealers would take the opportunity to start a refresh?","Edward J. Rapp","","Yeah. Henry, this is Ed. Yeah, I think we\u2019re already seeing some of that in terms of dealers refreshing those rental fleets. But if you look at it in terms of the total fleet size, it\u2019s still below kind of historic levels, historical peaks and on average the age is older. And I think it\u2019s not only a view of the rental fleet, but I didn\u2019t get a pretty good proxy for customer fleets are, especially in the developed parts of the world.","They were in a period of uncertainty, they just delay the decision to make that, an upgrade to the fleet that new purchase. And so like I said, as we talk about moving forward, I didn\u2019t get the point in time, they get greater clarity. So one in that helps is that, we did finally get a passage of a highway bill. We are starting to see some \u2013 the bottoming out and improvement in housing. I think as those issues get a bit clear, the opportunities for not only rental fleet replenishment, but also the upgrade of customer fleets is one of the opportunity that lies ahead.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","That\u2019s helpful. And could you share your latest thoughts on Cat Financial and your appetite to take risk there, gain share or use this competitive weapon?","Edward J. Rapp","Henry, it\u2019s \u2013 Cat Financial has been a competitive weapon since we launched it back in the 1980s. And the thing that we do with Cat Financial is, we stay very close to home. so it\u2019s there to support and pursue the growth of the Caterpillar business. and if you think about the \u201808, \u201809 financial crisis and how well it performed, I think it shows the benefits of staying very close to home in terms of the way you manage your capital finance company.","I think with the uncertainty that you have today in the financial markets having a capital finance company has become, I think even a bigger strategic advantage. I think the other place where we\u2019re going to see it play out is the strategic advantages, drive the full integration of Bucyrus, is we\u2019ll really be \u2013 the only full line provider in that mining industry and plus with the captive finance company, I think there\u2019s a real strategic advantage there. But we\u2019re not going to significantly alter our risk appetite. We think we manage that part of the company well, I think you\u2019ll see us consistently manage it moving forward. But as you saw with the results, they had a good quarter, they\u2019re a great part of the company.","Mike DeWalt","","Thanks, Henry.","Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Hey, it's Vertical Research Partners, good morning. I wondered, you mentioned rail was strong in the press release, and I wondered if you could break that down into a pre-buy maybe North America versus \u2013 I know rail has been booming in mining globally. is that a business that\u2019s gotten up into a solid double-digit profit margin or is it still lagging?","Mike DeWalt","","Yeah. A lot of the rail increase that we\u2019ve seen so far this year has actually been in North America, and to your point, a few years from now, there will be a move to new emission standards in rail. And I think there are certainly some buying that\u2019s going on ahead of that. We\u2019re actually doing a bit better than the industry, when we acquired EMD, it had lost a lot of its business over the years to GE, and thankfully we\u2019ve taken some of that back now. So actually we\u2019re doing pretty well.","In terms of profitability, in general, that business is actually doing quite a bit better than when we bought it. We\u2019ve got the new factory going in Indiana right now in Muncie. They have come up on production remarkably well. We had a good quarter despite the fact that we essentially shifted assembly in the first of the second quarter from Ontario to Indiana. So they\u2019ve done a great job.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC\t","Okay, great. And then if I could ask another, Power Systems follow-up, just on electric, one of your competitors had cited some weakness I know, you have some tough comp issues that maybe are fading. Is it possible for electric power gen to be up for you guys this year? Do you have an order book that would support that or is it looking a little softer?","Mike DeWalt","","Well, a couple of things. One, if you look at our overall power systems business versus that competitor that we\u2019re talking about, thank goodness for rail and thank goodness for oil and gas, it\u2019s good to have a quite vary business, so we have some end markets that are weaker, we have some that are stronger, and we happen to have a very good balance.","So in total, you saw our sales to end users accelerate the three-month moving average from overall plus 2 to a plus 7 in June, and that was a good thing. But I do, there are comments about Power Systems in general, particularly the smaller diesel end of it. We're definitely seeing that in the marketplace. And so, certainly at the smaller end of electric power, it will likely be a negative year. At the big end and the turbine end, we had some really tough comparables in the first quarter that were with us throughout March.","And so year-over-year, that part of the businesses has been a little \u2013 comparably a little pressed because we had such big turbine sales in the first quarter a year ago. But on balance, I would say the bigger stuff is a little better than the small stuff. And the competitor that you referred to is probably relatively speaking stronger than the small stuff.","Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Yep, true. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.","Seth R. Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Equity Research","","Hey, good morning. It's RBC.","Mike DeWalt","Good morning, Seth.","Seth R. Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Equity Research","Good morning. Back to the mining business, you gave some good color on the trends in the truck side. Can you give us \u2013 can you comment why you're seeing more in the underground side?","Mike DeWalt","Underground hard rock or underground coal? Underground hard rock has amongst the longest backlog of all of our products. You mean underground coal, Bucyrus underground coal?","Seth R. Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Equity Research","Yeah, the old DBT business.","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, that's probably weaker than the rest. We talked a lot about that, I think in the first quarter, where we were seeing some decline there. We haven't broken out on Bucyrus, lot of detail separately in the outlook, but I think the overall sales for Bucyrus this year are going to be lower than we had originally thought, and really for two reasons. One is, underground coals are bit weaker.","Thankfully, we don\u2019t have as much of our business tied up in U.S. underground coal, maybe our largest competitor does, but it\u2019s still going to be a bit of a negative. And on the flip side of that, we\u2019ve now sold four of the distribution businesses to Cat dealers. Those are in our numbers now, and in our outlooks. So that will probably take a little bit off the top line for Bucyrus as well, and that\u2019s baked into our outlook as well.","Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Okay, thanks. If I could follow-up on Europe, on the construction equipment business, can you just comment, did it accelerate to the downside through the quarter, I mean are you seeking trends get weaker there during the quarter?","Mike DeWalt","","Yeah, I think it\u2019s probably fair to say. I mean, if you just look at Europe, Africa, Middle East rolling numbers, you\u2019ve seen that monthly get weaker. And I think that\u2019s definitely, that\u2019s certainly been the case in Europe. Europe has moved from \u2013 Europe, Africa, Middle East has moved from up to being about flat, and it\u2019s moved that way throughout the quarter.","Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And do you think that, that continues to deteriorate through the year or is that kind of stabilize at a low level here?","Mike DeWalt","It\u2019s \u2013 again, we don\u2019t provide our outlook in that, quite that level of detail. But to Ed\u2019s point earlier, we have a decent sales outlook for the back half of the year. We\u2019re not looking for a big deterioration. That said, there are pluses and minuses. We\u2019re seeing for example, better business in Brazil, that\u2019s turning up a bit. And you also would have seen that in the Latin American numbers, it moved from I think down 6% to down 3%.","So, I know you\u2019re seeing that move a little better. It was actually positive later in the quarter. And in fact, our machine retail sales also (inaudible) in June, we report the three month moving average. But from a monthly perspective, June was the best month we\u2019ve had since January, in terms of month-over-month increase. It was one the best months on a volume basis we\u2019ve ever had.","Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation and then post your question.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning; JPMorgan.","Mike DeWalt","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Good morning. Can we take a step back again and look at U.S. construction. Doug, you noted on CNBC this morning that, you are seeing more broad-based recovery in housing starts across the country. Is there thesis out there that the rental channel is secularly going to grow versus kind of a contract or ownership. What are you guys seeing out there right now and Doug, when would you anticipate that your contract customers would start to purchase equipment again rather than rent, which they usually do at the beginning of a cycle. But as we get into the cycle, they usually prefer to own their own equipment. What are you guys seeing out there, and what do you think happens over the course of the next year or two?","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Well, my comments earlier on broad-based housing recovery is relative. I mentioned that I was on the West Coast in California specifically, and I met with several contractors and all of them had for the first time in five years, a subdivision underway. And none of them were massive projects like we saw in the 2000. But it was fairly widespread in that subdivision here, a subdivision there in different areas of California. I was impressed with that but from a very, very small base. I\u2019ve heard that elsewhere around the country as well. I think the housing statistic support that as we look at that. There is no question that rental market, the multifamily is booming I guess in some parts, and I \u2013 we can take advantage of that.","I don\u2019t really see our contractor base significantly kicking up orders based on housing probably until at least next year. If anything happens, it will be the transportation spending and some degree of clarity on that through the highway bill we just saw as opposed to the next two and half years, and I would say that, if we see it, when we see, it\u2019d really be spring is too late in this construction season to get much underway.","We\u2019ll see it first in the rental market for sure, and depending on the prospects of the debt cliff and everything else in this country, and how that settles out this winter, that will impact the spring greatly. So I see a couple of those things coming together that could be positive and (inaudible) itself up as some of the politicians are threatening, I guess it would be negative.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Fair enough. And then on the operating side, you noted that material costs were flat in the quarter, should we anticipate or why wouldn\u2019t we anticipate that material cost should not be a tailwind going forward from here, particularly, even if the pricing weakens there, but it\u2019s still a positive, shouldn\u2019t then it be a positive for Caterpillar going forward?","Mike DeWalt","Yeah, and this is Mike. Even when commodity prices were moving up, the impact on our actual material cost was quite muted. If you go back to the first quarter, we were up about 1%. Last year, we went up much more than 1%. So it was \u2013 the impacts on those are quite muted and part of that is because \u2013 for a lot of our purchase volume, we agree prices annually, we\u2019re not \u2013 the majority of our material purchase are not actually commodities. So I think broadly speaking, your sentiment is correct, obviously, the portion of our business, it is commodity related, the pricing is a little bit easier, but I wouldn\u2019t get carried away in terms of order of magnitude there.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And just a little quick follow-up on that one then. You\u2019re looking at taking $1 billion out of inventory by year-end, what would the target be for days on hand or inventory turns, once we get through all the sales out there, do you see distribution businesses, et cetera, et cetera. What should we be looking at a year from now in terms of the right kind of inventory levels for Caterpillar?","Edward J. Rapp","Anne, if I was going to look out and net out all the acquisitions and all that and look out into 2013 type time frame, something around a three turns would be a place I\u2019d fall.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thanks.","Mike DeWalt","And that would be sort of \u2013 think of it as FIFO, not LIFO.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you. I appreciate that.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","I want to just comment here a little bit on our inventory outlook, run rates, et cetera, going forward. And I will tell you that we are playing the game here on a world that grows maybe anemically, but grows between now and let\u2019s call it the next 12 to 24 months, we are not playing for an implosion, we are not playing for a drop like we saw in \u201908. The (inaudible) that we see based on the monetary conditions that exists right now and the easy money flows should loosen up the economies a year from now, what we\u2019re seeing today is, are the effects and impact of pretty tight monetary policies a year ago. These things take time to wind through.","We have only in our dreams arrive at an availability position that we have today where we can concentrate on market share and pricing, which we\u2019re doing. I\u2019m very reluctant to take too bold of a move on inventory in China, because we have seen this China show before many times in the last 25 years. We\u2019ve seen it in terms of an absolute stop in demand for excavators and wheel loaders probably three times beside I\u2019ve been watching China in my career maybe four. And within a year, we\u2019ve seen a recovery sometimes blooming recovery and some just a nice recovery.","We are in a position today where if we miss that and have insufficient inventory with an amount of competition we have there, we will be out of that game and it will be hard to get into a leadership position that we want. So we are watching China very carefully, there is no question we have too much inventory for today's run rate of sales, but again, I\u2019m not at all convinced that a year from now or less or a little more, we\u2019ll see China back on its feet as we have seen so many times in the past. And everybody can argue that this is different in China\u2019s change and maybe it has, but I suspect there will be some amount of recovery, we will be in a position where we have availability and we can build pans in our distribution model that will work for us long-term.","That\u2019s not a dissimilar place where we are with PVCs. We arguably are a bit heavy everywhere today at the run rate, but we are in a position where we finally have availability that we build capacity around that we didn\u2019t have in the last two recoveries around here. And certainly that\u2019s been part of our strategy is to take market share with availability. Our quality levels are as good as we\u2019ve ever seen them, our efficiency levels are as good as we\u2019ve ever seen them. and we now have availability in the marketplace. We\u2019re not playing for implosion, we\u2019re playing for arguable growth maybe anemic, but as I said here today and we look at \u201813 as Ed said is almost got to be better on economic basis. GDP growth in the world, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re playing for.","So well, yes we are watching inventory. Yes, I was very worried inventory turnover, we\u2019re doing all we can with our supply chain and it is on the improving. we don't want to call this the wrong way with too little inventory and I would say, get stuck with too much, so it\u2019s all hands on all levers everyday with inventory and run rate, we\u2019ve got schedules in the third quarter that are very much reduced with maintenance shutdowns, with vacation shutdowns around the world and will manage production to sales that way as well. But inventory levels are important, if we believe the world is going to grow, which we do maybe anemically. I guess that would be my strength around all of that, which is a little late and I apologize for that. but it is something we\u2019re managing, we're being very, very cautious and guarded with both on the upside and the downside when it comes to working capital specifically inventory.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Fair point, Doug, thanks for the color.","Mike DeWalt","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation then post your question.","Jamie L. Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, good morning, Credit Suisse and a nice quarter. Two questions, one Doug with regards to the economic outlet, you just sort of laid out and obviously you guys are a little more constructive on 2013 related to what the market is saying, or relative to what your stock is saying. I guess just beyond 2012, and given the environment you just laid out, how do you think about CapEx? I mean do we need to say at this $4 billion number to meet your targets in an okay macro, but slightly weaker than what you\u2019re calling for? And then I guess how do you think about share repo in that context given where your stock is?","And then I guess my second question is, can you just talk about your comfort level with dealer inventory levels outside of China? And I guess my thought or concern would be as I talked to dealers and just given the weaker macro and just given your ability to deliver and given the fact that your lead times have come in. Do you think the dealers can sit there with less inventory than they have been historically, one, because they\u2019re concerned of the macro is weaker; and two, they\u2019re not as worried as they were historically that Cat can\u2019t deliver. They have the actual confidence that Cat will deliver the equipments, they don\u2019t need to sit this much, with this much inventory that you\u2019ve had historically?","Douglas R. Oberhelman","","You got a lot of there Jamie; let me take the CapEx one right off the bat. We are on track to get close to $4 billion, but I will tell you also that each of our groups whether it\u2019s construction or resource, or our aftermarket business are looking at that very carefully. We\u2019ve significantly, I\u2019d say delayed. Some of our plants and most of our plants in China for the time being as a result of that market to see how that\u2019s sorts out. We have an aftermarket distribution business that is very antiquated that needs upgraded. And most of the CapEx you can argue is capacity related, but I would also equally argue that it\u2019s cost reduction related, all of the Victoria, Texas excavator plant, small dozer plant in Georgia that we\u2019re expanding to bring production back here. Those are cost reduction activities as well.","Again, we\u2019re playing for growth albeit slight growth. And significant cut backs in CapEx would only hinder us in \u201914, \u201915, you may have to do it. Sure as I\u2019m sitting here today, if something happens on a macro scale between now and year-end and we have to take actions. We will and we will do it. But right now, we are planning for some kind of growth in the next 12 months to 24 months. That\u2019s kind of around the CapEx, that\u2019s kind of around the inventory questions. I think there is no question that builders are gaining confidence and our ability to supply equipment and our PVCs are at optimum levels. Hopefully that model will work. They will carry less, we will carry more, the chain takes cost out. That\u2019s what we are seeing, but again depending on if we see growth, we\u2019ll have to adjust that model, I forgot what you had in the middle in there Jamie.","Mike DeWalt","","Share repurchase?","Jamie L. Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah, share repurchase.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Yeah, how could I forget that one.","Jamie L. Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Especially, the $82.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","I know it\u2019s a little cheap at $82, but having said that we have a balance sheet today with debt-to-debt and cap at 40 and net debt position when we consider our cash and securities at somewhere around 34, 35, and I want to be sure that as we go forward in this very uncertain world, although I have painted it somewhat rosy with anemic growth. Then we have a bulletproof rock solid balance sheet that we never have to worry about our credit rating or dividend, which I don\u2019t think we do. Share repurchase is not on our radar screen today, it\u2019s the last of our priorities. I have said before, I think I\u2019ve said to all of you that I hope in my career, which has a few years to go, I can buy one share back, but right now, we\u2019ve got other priorities and I think we are investing them wisely.","Jamie L. Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Great, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Robert Mccarthy. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.","Robert Mccarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, Robert W. Baird. Good morning everybody.","Mike DeWalt","Hey, Rob.","Robert Mccarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Jamie basically asked my question, but the other side of that coin is, with valuations to press, they have been recognizing them certainly as well to do with that. How tempted our user try to take advantage of that and may continue what so far it look like pretty successful external investment program, and tell me about acquisition?","Edward J. Rapp","","Well Rob, this is Ed. I mean, we played out kind of our cash deployment strategy, and I think you\u2019re going to see us consistently, stay focused on it. We think the number one is the opportunity for growth, we moved aggressively in terms of the acquisition space, we try to do it early in the cycle, because it is easier to integrate as you work through the cycle.","I think on the acquisition front today, our primary focus is what I would describe to slowdown to digest. We feel good about where we are at with the integration of Bucyrus, with lot of work. We feel good about where we\u2019re at in terms of EMD, and Mike talked about the operating performance there, but there's still more work to do, as well with MWM and Siwei. So, I think you're going to see us stay clearly focused on integrating what we have in the acquisition space.","Robert Mccarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Ed, if that's the case, you're not showing any appetite really to try to reduce the absolute level of debt on the balance sheet. So, should we just then expect to see cash continue, I mean you\u2019re generating significant free cash flow, we\u2019re just going to watch that accumulate on the balance sheet over the next two quarters to four quarters?","Edward J. Rapp","Maybe, and we\u2019d like to get that debt-to-cap gross number, not the net number down into the low-30s. And I think that that types of stuffs to have inflexibility we want in a downturn, for acquisition, for any growth opportunity that comes along. So I would say that the concentration on the balance sheet while it\u2019s generating cash and making sure our poster numbers are at that 25% levels exactly where we would be in the next two years, particularly the level of uncertainly out there.","Robert Mccarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. My follow-up has to do with, I guess disclosure, if that\u2019s the right way to characterize it. but we\u2019ve now anniversary to Bucyrus acquisition, so two subquestions. One, does that mean next quarter, you are going to stop providing visibility into its performances differentiated from the rest of resources? and second, Doug, do you have some plans to maybe quantify the company\u2019s progress towards its existing synergy targets when we see you at MINExpo?","Mike DeWalt","","I\u2019ll handle the first part of that.","Robert Mccarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Mike DeWalt","And probably, I\u2019ll handle the second part too.","Robert Mccarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Yeah. That would be fine.","Mike DeWalt","The first part is yeah, we\u2019ll probably continue to report Bucyrus just as we are throughout the rest of this year.","Robert Mccarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Right.","Mike DeWalt","","They are for example not in our monthly dealer statistics from a disclosure standpoint. and we would plan on doing that for example, at the beginning of 2013 where you have good comparables. So we\u2019ll continue to break it out, certainly for the rest of this year. And in terms of MINExpo, we have an outline of at this point what we\u2019re thinking about in terms of material to share at MINExpo. Since it is MINExpo, it will probably be a little extra emphasis on mining and Bucyrus is a piece of that that we\u2019ll talk about that.","Douglas R. Oberhelman","Yeah. We\u2019ll put some definition around that and beside that our synergies plan and the business case is ahead of schedule as of today. And we\u2019ll talk, we\u2019ll get into some detail on that in the September for sure.","Robert Mccarthy \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","We\u2019ll look forward to that.
