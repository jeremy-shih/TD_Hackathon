Welcome to the Juniper Networks First Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lubert, you may begin.","Jess Lubert","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks we will take questions. Please lime yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. The March quarter played out largely as expected total revenue of $1.2 billion [ph] was above the midpoint of our guidance, as we experienced slightly better than anticipated trends across each of our core verticals.","Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 came in above our guidance range due to better than expected sales, stronger gross margins, continued cost controls and higher interest income, which together offset a higher than anticipated tax rate and share count.","We're pleased with the progress we experienced versus our forecast. However, we are not satisfied with our Q1 results and remain laser focused on delivering a return to growth later this year. We believe we remain on track to achieve this objective and I'd like to walk through some of the items that are driving confidence in our ability to achieve this goal.","First, we are continuing to invest in our go to market organization, which underwent a restructuring and a change in leadership earlier this year. While changes such as these are never easy and our actions created some anticipated headwinds, we saw improved momentum through the course of the quarter.","Based on this momentum, I'm increasingly confident we have the right sales structure and strategy in place to win in the market. We are now in the process of adding sales headcount, which I believe should help accelerate our momentum through the course of the year.","Second, we are continuing to see healthy trends in our Enterprise business. While this vertical was most impacted by the go to market disruption we experienced in the start of the year, Enterprise still experienced 3% year-over-year growth in Q1. Normalizing for an unusually large financial services transaction a year ago, our run rate Enterprise business grew double-digits in the quarter, which we think highlights the underlying health of the business.","We remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our Enterprise business, which we believe is likely to see the greatest impact from our investment in incremental go to market headcount, as well as the recent acquisition of Mist Systems which closed in the second quarter.","Third and building upon this last point, we're very excited about the acquisition of Mist Systems, a pioneer in cloud managed, wireless networks, powered by artificial intelligence. We believe Mist is truly disruptive technology and the early feedback from both customers and the field has been very positive.","We are early in the process of integrating Mist into our go to market motion and educating the field on how to sell the company's products. While we do not expect Mist to generate material revenue during the 2019, we believe the Mist portfolio positions Juniper to disrupt the $6 billion wireless LAN market and pull-through sales of our campus switching solutions which could positively impact our results later in the year.","Fourth, we are continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for more than 10% of revenue during the first quarter. This strength was driven by a combination of on-box and off-box offerings with revenue from our Contrail family of SDN-enabled management and control software solutions increasing nearly 40% year-over-year.","While our success may not be linear, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time, especially as we introduce new products and new business models designed to better monetize the value of our offerings over the next few quarters.","Finally, we are continuing to see strength in our services business, which grew 3% year-over-year and accounted for 38% of our overall revenue. Our service team continues to execute well, driving strong services attach rates and renewals.","While not a surprise, we continue to experience weakness within the cloud and service provider verticals. Our cloud business remains challenged as several of our large customers continue to run their networks hatter and the pace of port deployments was not great enough to offset ASP declines.","While this dynamic caused our cloud revenue to accelerate as expected during the March quarter, we were encouraged to see a pickup in order toward the end of the period, which is providing confidence that momentum should improve over the next few quarters.","Based on the capacity demand we are currently seeing, we remain confident we are holding our cloud footprint in the areas of the network where we have historically played.","While we see the potential for improved port growth in our existing footprint to drive a return to growth over time, new use cases will be needed to achieve our long-term model.","We are laser focused on capturing this opportunity and view 400 gig as an inflection point that creates opportunities for wins later this year that should drive share gains in future period.","Our current product roadmap and strong customer relationships are driving confidence in our ability to secure these net new use cases in the cloud, particularly in the data center where we have a little present today.","Within the service provider vertical, we continue to experience headwinds tied to our customer's business model pressures and the expected timing of project deployments. While we believe our service provider business is likely to remain challenged during the June quarter, we do expect the vertical to experience better trends during the second half of the year.","We believe our service provider relationships remain strong and with our new MX 5G line cards about to start shipping, the Ericsson relationship off to a good start and our Contrail orchestration platform deeply entrenched at a number of global Tier 1 service providers, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on carrier 5G and telco cloud initiatives that are likely to start playing out later this year.","I think it's worth highlighting that we are in the early stages of launching several important new products that should strengthen our competitive position across our service provider, cloud and enterprise markets.","Some of these anticipated products include, new MX 5G line cards that will enhance our 5G positioning and ability to capitalize on service provider capacity requirements.","New QFX switches and PTX routing platforms designed to capitalize on customer 400-gig upgrades, enhanced Contrail enterprise multi cloud software capabilities that break down the barriers of incumbency and make moving to a multi-vendor, multi-cloud state a reality with increased simplicity and reduced cost.","New cloud delivered enterprise capabilities that enhance our ability to penetrate enterprise campus and branch opportunities and new silicon photonics capabilities that potentially open new addressable market and enhance our competitive position during the 400 gig cycle.","We believe 5G, the 400 gig upgrade cycle, SD enterprise and enterprise multi-cloud initiatives each represent large multi-year opportunities where we should be well-positioned to benefit over the next few years.","Based on our current pipeline of opportunities, we expect to see normal seasonal trends during the June quarter. While we expect to see sequential growth through the remainder of the year and return to year-over-year growth during the fourth quarter, we do see the potential for seasonality to have some impact during the September quarter. Importantly, we remain confident in the long-term model we highlighted at our November 2018 Investor Day.","I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders.","I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.","Ken Miller","Thank you, Rami. And good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our first quarter results and end with some color on our outlook.","First quarter revenue of 1.2 billion [ph] was above the midpoint of our guidance. In addition non-GAAP gross margin at 59.3% was toward the higher end of our guidance range. These results, along with prudent expense management and higher than anticipated other income build non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 above our guidance range.","Looking at revenue by vertical, results were largely in line with our expectations. Enterprise increased 3% year-over-year. Sequentially enterprise decreased 20% which is more than normal seasonality. As expected, our enterprise business was impacted by transitions in our go to market organization.","Service provider decreased 9% year-over-year and 16% sequentially due to weakness across all geographies. Cloud decreased 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. While cloud capacity continue to grow, the growth in units was not enough to offset expected ASP erosion.","From a technology perspective, routing decreased 8% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Switching decreased to 23% year-over-year and sequentially. Security decreased 7% year-over-year and 35% sequentially.","Our services business increased 3$ year-over-year, but decreased 5% sequentially. Software grew year-over-year and was greater than 10% of total revenue.","In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, three were cloud, six were service provider and one was an enterprise. Product deferred revenue was $140 million, down 12% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments.","For the first quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 59.3%. The stronger than expected non-GAAP margin was primarily due to lower service costs and increased software. In the quarter we had cash flow from operations of $159 million. The primary reason for the sequential decline was due to lower net income, partially offset by net changes in working capital.","We continue to execute our capital return program paying $66 million in dividends in the quarter, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the first quarter of 2019 was $3.5 billion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the repayment of our $350 million bond that matured in the quarter. We continue to focus on maintaining an efficient capital structure.","Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide you some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website.","Our Q2 revenue outlook reflects normal seasonal trends, and while we expect revenue grow on a sequential basis beyond the second quarter, we do expect to see some impact from seasonality in Q3.","We expect to return to year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. We remain confident in our long-term financial model that we outlined at our Investor Day in November of last year.","Full year non-GAAP gross margin is expected to improve directionally with revenue volume from Q1 '19 levels and we believe gross margin for the year will be toward the midpoint of our long-term model.","We plan to manage our operating expenses prudently; however, we expect the Mist Systems acquisition will be dilutive to earnings in 2019. Based on our current forecast we expect non-GAAP operating expenses on a full year basis to be flat to slightly up versus 2018.","For the remainder of 2019, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be lower than Q1'19 levels. We expect higher interest income compared to the prior years due to favourable interest rates.","Due to the impact of the acquisition of Mist Systems and a higher than anticipated tax rate, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.75 plus or minus $0.05 for 2019. If not for these items, our previous non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year would remain unchanged.","The accelerated share repurchase program or ASR initially planned for Q1 '19 was delayed due to the acquisition of Mist Systems. We now anticipate entering into an ASR for approximately three $300 million this quarter, reflecting our continued conviction in our future prospects.","In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper success.","Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vijay Bhagavath, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Bhagavath","Hi. My question is in the back half, please help us understand two big product cycles out there Wi-Fi 6 [ph] 400 gig in the cloud. Are these weighted more towards the fourth quarter or we could see any actions targeting the September quarter? Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Vijay. So there is in fact a number of different product cycles that we're expecting will help this year. I think it starts with just our routing portfolio, in particular the MX 5G line card upgrades and we anticipate that those will shift this quarter. And typically the ramp for products like that where there is a large deployed base will start in the second half of the year. So that does feed into the confidence that we have in the second half.","I've talked at length about the 400 gig, pretty broad product transition that cuts across routing and switching. The main focus for 400 gig will be on Wind [ph] this year that will feed into volume deployments and share next year.","And then you mentioned wireless LAN, that's obviously a new and very important area of focus for us. There are a number of opportunities that we're seeing already in the early stages of integrating Mist into our portfolio and you know, not just in terms of wireless LAN, but the - it looks like our thesis for the pull-through effect of wireless LAN into other areas, like security and switching is playing out as expected thus far. So I'm quite optimistic about that.","And then the Wi-Fi 6 standard that's going to be coming about, I think starts to work its way into volume deployments, not probably latter half of this year and into next year. So we're well-equipped to capture that trend as well. But I do believe that even prior to that we're going to see some good growth in that area.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thanks, Rami. A quick follow up for Ken if I may. Ken, you know recently you mentioned about, like staffing up sales headcount, how should we think about OpEx as percentage of revenue and you know any dynamics on the product gross margin line heading into the back half? Thanks.","Ken Miller","Yeah. So we did talk about full year OpEx for the year would be flat to slightly up. That is the last call we talked about it being approximately slow. So I do expect it to be flat to slightly up, that is a slight change, that is predominantly due to the Mist acquisition which as we mentioned on the Mist acquisition call a couple of months ago, it is going to be dilutive this year, the acquisition of Mist, but we do expect it to be accretive next year. So that OpEx is now in our forecast.","In addition to that, I do - we are investing a bit in sales. Now a lot of the sales investment is being fueled or funded by some of the transformation we've already done in sales. We've taken some cost out, but we are putting more back in, so we will see a little bit of OpEx growth on the go to market side as well.","But overall our OpEx as percentage of revenue should improve as I expect revenue to grow sequentially much faster and you know, that OpEx.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Kvaal, Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Yes. I guess, I have a question and a clarification if I could. I think first on the question, when should we start to hear about progress in 400. Are you going to be able to share that in the second half? And to what extent do you have confidence that you'll be able to win on both the switching and potentially on the routing side as well?","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Thanks for the question Jeff. So we're doing everything. At this point right now we're laser focused on the 400 gig opportunity that is ahead of us. And there is obviously a big technology dimension to this and across the entire technology stack from our software capabilities, we've - as I've mentioned in the past made some very meaningful modifications and enhancements to our operating system to provide the modularity, the API program ability that our cloud customers want.","We're working very closely with our big hyperscale cloud provider, as well as the Tier 2 worldwide cloud providers and meeting some of the specific requirements that they have, sometimes for example in terms of hosting third party agents that are very important to their network deployments.","We're also, I believe based on what we know today, we have made exactly the right decisions in choosing merchant silicon technology for some parts or some layers of the data center network and our own custom silicon technology that I actually believe quite strongly that should give us some meaningful advantage and differentiation from a - especially a cost performance and the power efficiency standpoint.","And then of course, there's engagement. Right now the engagement level with our large cloud provider customers is very high, engineer to engineer and talking about specific opportunities, what's required to capture them. I have no doubt this is going to be a very competitive space, but I'm quite confident that we're doing everything that we can. And we have a very competitive portfolio that will allow us to take share.","You know, in terms of when it will become visible. Winds [ph] are rarely announced in this space. Our customers, our cloud customers in particular tend to be somewhat quiet about this.","But I do think if we start to secure layers of the network, in particular data center interconnect and the data center itself that will start to contribute meaningfully to revenue next year.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Okay, perfect. And then my second more of a clarification. Do you feel like the changes in the enterprise go to market strategy are behind you now and we should get back to that low double-digit growth rate in the second quarter and through the balance of the year?","Rami Rahim","Yeah. So, no doubt there was some disruption in Q1 as we had anticipated and these changes are never easy, but honestly I'm very happy that we went through them. I do believe that the hard part is behind us. I think we have a much more efficient sales organization. Right now we removed layers, we increased span of control, we of course changed leadership and all of that I believe is going to result in better sales execution in the future.","There still as we mentioned upfront some hiring to do to fill some of the gaps we've created in the sales organization or the opportunities I should say in the sales organization where we're going to be primarily focusing on you know front lines, native quota carrying sales representatives, across the whole segment, but in particular in the enterprise segment, we'll be filling those opportunities throughout the rest of the year. And I'm very optimistic and in fact confident that this will start to help us in the second half of the year.","So part of our confidence in the improved sequential performance of the company comes from the fact that we're investing now in sales that will help us in the second part of this year and certainly into next year.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Thank you, Rami.","Rami Rahim","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron, Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Ittai Kidron","Thanks. Hi, guys. A couple for me. First, Rami you've kind of laid out a very detailed new product roadmap here. It sounds like the next couple two, three quarters are going to be very busy from a refresh cycle standpoint.","I guess, how do I get my hands around the risks that are associated with the refresh in the context of potentially customers pausing ahead of a refresh, how you accounting for that in your outlook for the year?","Rami Rahim","Yeah. We don't anticipate a lot of overhang or pausing in anticipation of new products that are coming. There's always some element of risk associated with that when you're introducing new products. But honestly I don't believe that it's going to be a big factor and certainly we've weaved that or we have anticipated that in the outlook that we have provided.","Ittai Kidron","Okay. Very good. And then with regards to Mist, can you be a little bit more specific with respect to the contribution of Mist in the June quarter, how much revenue you expect this to deliver and perhaps how was - how big is the headcount that you've added to with this acquisition?","Rami Rahim","Yeah. So we mentioned previously that we do expect it to be dilutive for this year and accretive next. All of the OpEx we take on day one and they're still in a ramp mode for revenue obviously. They have fairly immature amounts of revenue and we take in fairly immature amounts into this calendar year.","That said, they're growing quite nicely and we do see it as a very strategic opportunity to insert into net new customers. But from a revenue perspective, particularly Q2 revenue it's quite immaterial, but we should start to ramp from there.","Ittai Kidron","Rami, when you look at Mist, how quickly do you think they get fully incorporated into your sell cycle. Are they going to be kept separate from a sales standpoint or mandated to sell Juniper gear [ph] as well? Help me think about that.","Rami Rahim","Yeah. So we are largely keeping Mist as a standalone entity within the company with the goal of ensuring that the momentum that they've seen over the last couple of years not only continues but accelerates. We're focusing primarily now on educating and enabling our broad sales organization to be able to sell the technology. And we're keeping the sales - the Mist most sales team as a standalone specialist team that can go after net new wireless LAN opportunity.","And like I said earlier, so far we're seeing that it's become a great door opener for us in net new accounts where we have an opportunity to sell more of the portfolio, in addition of course to wireless LAN.","Now over time, there will be more technical integration. But honestly we're being cautious, careful and taking our time. As you might have seen we announced not too long ago a software defined enterprise offering that comes across as the WAN, as the security, SD switching and we have done some integration with Mist already to provide a holistic solution for enterprise customers. And so thus far the reception from customers, although it's early has been really encouraging.","Ittai Kidron","Very good. Good luck, guys.","Rami Rahim","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Leopold, Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Simon Leopold","Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to first touch on - and sort of try and understand product mix versus vertical mix, in that I would expect that that routing would tend to be stronger than service provider and cloud and less strong in the Enterprise group, yet the vertical mix sort of moved in the wrong direction in terms of relative to what I'd expect on product mix. Could you help me sort of think about the correlation between your product groups and your verticals? Thank you. And I have a follow up.","Rami Rahim","Sure. So yeah, I mean, you're right that SP [ph] is predominantly routing. We've talked about that at on analyst day, I want to say 80% plus of our service provider business is routing.","Cloud is majority is routing, but switching actually has a bigger share than it doesn't say service provider. But still the majority of our cloud business has been routing, has always been that case, that way.","With an enterprise, it's predominately switching and security and - but we have a very - over the last several quarters we've been actually growing our routing business, albeit it's still the third in rank order of technologies into that vertical.","Simon Leopold","Can you explain that quarter because the movement was the opposite, routing got better, but service provider and cloud are weak and enterprise was strong, so that's where I'm confused","Rami Rahim","I mean, all verticals were down and all technologies were down sequentially. I think you're better comment is more about tempering of growth rates. But you know, on a year-on-year basis we did see routing down eight and service provider down nine, pretty highly correlated.","Enterprise was the one vertical they grew on a year-on-year basis and the one technology that grew within enterprise, actually two technologies, routing and a little bit of security growth within enterprise switching was down in enterprise.","It's worth mentioning that some of the newer routing products that we've introduced over the last year have been really optimized for net new footprint, where we have not really participated in the past in the route, in the enterprise space. So products like the MX10003, the MX204 have been very well received by the enterprise market.","Simon Leopold","That's helpful Rami. So just to follow up, I wanted to get a perspective of you - in terms of your longer term vision on your silicon photonics products that you discussed at the Optical Trade Show in March.","So I understand you're really just getting started, but we've sized the market for data center transceivers at maybe 1.5 kind of plus billion for 100 gig. I just want to get your sense of where you think you can take that particular business as you grow it? Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Yeah. I appreciate the question. So we remain optimistic, excited about the silicon photonics opportunity. I mean, the fact of the matter is, there is a large part of the network investment that happens by our customers. That's not in the network elements themselves, but it's in the interconnect between networking elements.","We've always looked at the 100 gig cycle as an opportunity to learn, because 100 gig cycle as you know is very mature right now. There are a number of offerings that are in the market right now. Pricing is already quite competitive and we are doing just that from 100 gig.","We have run into some challenges with our 100 gig silicon photonics efforts, not in the core technology, but in the assembly level 400 gig. And those - the lessons from that are all feeding their way into 400 gig and we decided basically we're going to emphasize or put most of our energy and attention on getting 400 gig and the goal for 400 gig will be to release 400 gig optics using our core, very differentiated IP technology right at the beginning of the volume deployment for 100 gig.","So whereas we had anticipated shipping, you know, 100 gig products in the first half of the year, I would say that's not going to happen, but we're on track to deliver the 400 gig product where I believe the opportunity to really differentiate from an economic standpoint in time for the volume ramps.","Simon Leopold","And you think that's maybe the turn of the calendar year?","Rami Rahim","Is around that time frame, yes.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thank you very much for that. Helpful.","Rami Rahim","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein, Cohen. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks, Ken, did I hear you correctly that you expect gross margins to hit the midpoint of your 58% to 62% fiscal '19 through '21 guidance this year, was that the comment?","Ken Miller","Yeah. So for full year FY '19, I expect margin to be approximate the midpoint, which is 60%.","Paul Silverstein","And can you discuss the visibility and the opportunities and risks to getting there. And I recognize it's a journey and there's still a ways to go. But can you talk about the ability to get to the higher end of that 58% to 62% range. What it will take and what timeframe?","Ken Miller","Yeah. So to get to the higher end it really comes down to mix and most of it is product mix that drives our margin more than anything. In addition, between now and the end of this year volumes will definitely play a factor in a positive way. So as we gain more volume this helps out our fixed cost, variable cost ratio, so that improves margin quite significantly as we ramp up throughout the year.","But going forward long term, the answer is predominantly in mix. You'll see more software sales is obviously a positive. And then having you know, the value engineering that we've been doing, the design for value efforts, we've been doing across all of our platforms.","We've talked a lot about 400 gig just as an example, those platforms we believe are going to better cost performance than our previous generation routing and switching lineups.","So we should see improvements, on kind of like-to-like product, but more significantly mix is the biggest factor moving forward.","Paul Silverstein","Ken, any change in pricing dynamics in the marketplace?","Ken Miller","We definitely have the pricing ASP erosion built into our long-term model. We're presuming those are going to be you know, normal kind of trends. There's nothing that we're expecting beyond kind of typical you know, cost per bit kind of price erosion.","Paul Silverstein","No accelerations?","Ken Miller","No.","Paul Silverstein","Great. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Ken Miller","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tejas Venkatesh, UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you. You talk about improved cloud orders toward the end of the quarter and you're making incremental sales investments into the enterprise. So I wonder how might you rank order the incremental growth opportunities by vertical over the next one to two years. You did lay out detailed targets at Analyst Day, but a lot has changed since then.","Rami Rahim","Yeah, thanks for the question. So in terms of cloud, I think this is going be a year of stability. Basically last year was you know was a tough year. We saw some meaningful declines as a result of the product transition. This year, I think we can say that the bulk of that product transition is behind us and we are in stability and rebuild mode off of you know, the base that we have created for ourselves now coming into this year.","I remain optimistic, that we have retained our footprint. We have done everything that is within our control and power to ensure that we are you know very relevant within our hyperscale cloud and our broader cloud customers. And I've talked at length about the technology that we have been working on will introduce into the market to see growth from here. And you know with the addition of net new footprint, I believe that the long term model that we provided in our Analyst event in November of last year is certainly within our grasp.","As far as the other two verticals you know, as you know in the SPE [ph] space, we anticipate that there is going to be - it's going remain a dynamic environment. Our service fighter customers are dealing with business model challenges of their own, and so for that reason our longer term outlook, our long term model has been slight declines in SP.","I do believe that there are catalysts that could improve things in the future. We're just not baking that into our model at this point. Things like 5G, our telco cloud, transformation efforts where we're essentially now building a new muscle and emotion in the SP space to help them transform their central offices into essentially service next generation highly automated service delivery engine. And the way we monetize that is not just through boxes, but by selling software. In particular, our Contrail software suite.","And enterprise is where I believe we should see growth this year, despite the fact that we lost the momentum in the Q1 period, primarily because of the trend - the changes that we made in the go to market organization, I believe that the market opportunity remains healthy. There's a lot of growth potential for us across both the data center, as well as the campus environment.","We as you know have made now investments, including M&A, in Mist systems that I believe gives us a really compelling portfolio. So I'm actually quite bullish on growth for the enterprise all of this year.","Tejas Venkatesh","And as a follow up, revenue this year will be similar to 2011. Now I know you're making organic investments and you've acquired Mist. But I wonder if there's been any additional thinking on M&A and what other parts of the portfolio you might want to round out. And is that why you have inked this $500 million credit revolver?","Rami Rahim","Yeah. In terms of M&A, I would say that if you look at what we did with Mist systems, it's a good example of the kind of what I would say really value creating M&A opportunities that we would pursue to accelerate a strategy that we were already embarking on.","You know, we have seen now for two years solid year-over-year growth in the enterprise space. We believe that the shift in the enterprise towards cloud delivered SaaS software based offerings is creating new opportunities. In fact, levelling the playing kph field, whereas in the past it was much more difficult to compete. We have our own organic efforts that we have put into the market that have helped us in achieving the momentum thus far. And we look to inorganic ideas like Mist systems that can only accelerate the pace of growth and that's a wonderful example of what we would be thinking about going forward as well.","Ken Miller","On a credit revolver side, I would urge you not to read too much into that, that's just really a timing situation, we had a revolver before, it was a five year life. It expires. We re-opt for another five years effectively. This I just think is good hygiene, it's a low cost, access to quick cash if needed. We have never drawn against our revolver in the past. At this point, I don't anticipate having to draw against this one either. It's just nice to have as a backstop.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Rod Hall","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, I want to come back to this OpEx issue and you know the fact that 100 gig is doesn't sound like it's going to be available in Q2, but it's only - I mean, that's less than two months since I guess you guys talked about so look at the [indiscernible]","And so I wonder when did you determine that it wasn't going to be available? And then I also want to clarify whether are you saying that you'll still deliver 100 gig at about the same time as 400 gig or are you skipping this? Can you just clarify what the roadmap now looks like with respect to those different speed technologies?","Rami Rahim","Yeah, Rod. Thanks for the question. I'm happy to clarify. So we've always thought about 100 gig as an opportunity for us to essentially flush out the technology, prove that the core technology works and then really make meaningful progress in terms of market share capture and differentiating our products in the 400 gig cycle, primarily because 100 gig have been - it's already a very mature market today.","In terms of timing of the assembly issues, it's very recent and we'll make a decision on 100 gigs later this year and we're certainly happy to keep you posted on that. But again, I want to emphasize the fact that we've always thought that 400 gig is where the opportunity largely lies. And I do believe that we'll be able to capture that opportunity the beginning of volume ramps, which is really around the beginning of next year.","Rod Hall","Okay. Thanks, Rami. And then I wanted to just - this is more of a clarification, but just as I look at the revenue trajectory, you guys are saying seasonality in Q3, but the last couple of years seasonality has been down quarter-on-quarter, so I'm assuming you're saying up a little bit, like low single digits in Q3. But if that's the case then your Q4 to get the year-over-year growth you've got to be up $50 million or $100 million, not you know, not maybe quite that much, but at least 50 sequentially and that's a pretty good sized quantum of revenue that you've got to achieve in the fourth quarter.","And I just wonder, it sounds like you feel pretty confident on the MX 5G line cards, but how much visibility do you have there and why do you have confidence you can get to growth in December?","Ken Miller","Let me talk about the seasonality and then I'll let - Rami, do you want to touch on the confidence in Q4. But - so you know, first of all to start off with this year is largely playing out as we expected, including the second half. We've been calling for improved second half trends throughout the whole year and historically it's important to note that Q2 and Q4 are typically our strongest quarter season from a sequential perspective, Q1 and Q3 have been challenged.","To your point, the last couple of years. Q3 has been kind of flattish. We do expect to do better and flat. We expect some sequential growth in Q3. But I think you know, about 3% is a good kind of expectation for Q3, about 3% sequential growth, which would be better than historical seasonal. But you know, kind of - you know, not as robust as Q2 and Q4, we expect goes to be stronger sequential quarters for us.","Rami Rahim","As far as the qualitative assessment of the second half, I'd say there are a number of things that give us some confidence. First is, we do have visibility into timing the of buildout. In the SP space in particular, but also in the enterprise and the cloud.","A big part of the sales transformation that we embarked on in the Q4 and Q1 has been around improving our forecast - forecasting rigour and I think we're going to start to see more of that benefit as we go - as this year plays out. It's already I believe helped us.","Second, I mentioned that coming out of Q1 we were encouraged by the momentum, relative to when how the quarter started, that I think feeds into our confidence. The sales investment, we we've essentially through the tough decisions and actions that we've made created the opportunity for us to invest in sales and I think that the product pipeline supports that investment.","And then yes, the innovation, both the organic innovation MX 5G, our software enhancements that we've made across all of our products really, especially in terms of management and simplicity of our switching, and then our security assets. And then last but not least, you know, our inorganic efforts with Mist that I think start to help in the latter part of the year as well.","Rod Hall","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Rami Rahim","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi. I just wanted to start off with the security business. Can you just help me understand the lumpiness you're seeing there? You had a good quarter in 4Q and then new 1Q you had a softer quarter. Can you just help us understand the lumpiness there? And can you also talk about kind of what you seeing in terms of discussions with some of these service providers relative to your security portfolio?","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Happy to address that. So security, we certainly lost some momentum in the Q1 period. Now a big part of that was the fact that there is a component of our security business that's very lumpy because it's essentially captured or its product that's sold to large customers in the cloud and service provider space.","So whereas we had healthy cloud and SP spending in the Q4 period, we just had much less of that in Q1 period. There's no good reason other than just timing of deployments.","Despite the fact that I do believe the sales transition had an impact, we actually saw our security grow on a year-over-year basis in the enterprise space, but I think that momentum has continued.","Looking forward for security, I think that the investment in go to market is going to help, especially on the enterprise side. In terms of the portfolio, we recently introduced the - or have significantly enhanced the high end of our security portfolio and we're seeing a lot of interest, especially in cloud and service provider, as well as some large enterprises, like financial services and banking.","In that product line, now many of the interest today shows up in terms of proof of concept testing, validation of features, et cetera. And that has a good potential of translating to sales and revenue in the up quarters.","And the last thing I wanted to say about security is that, we've really now integrated security into our solutions, our enterprise focused, service provider focused solutions. So if you take for example our software defined enterprise offering, that includes wireless LAN, now that includes switching. It also includes security with a single pane of glass, very simple, management interface that very much appeals to the enterprise market. We're thinking about security as a component of a portfolio sale increasingly and that has worked for us in the past. I think it's going to work for us going forward.","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. Can I quickly ask for an update, on at the Investor Day you talked about rolling out subscription offerings in the Frontiers [ph] and can we just ask for update where you stand ready for that. Is that something that's coming through in the remainder of the year or ramping up kind of as we go through to kind of the remaining quarters here?","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks for the question. So we did see good year-over-year growth in security - sorry in software and as we mentioned software is starting to contribute an increasingly significant portion of total revenue for the company. This is very much a part of the strategy that we have been executing on for the last couple of years.","It cuts across both on-box software offerings, as well as off-box offerings. You're right we presented to you at the November Analyst Day a very simple uniform business model around software for all of our products that we introduced into the market starting this year.","And as an example of that the MX 5G products that will be shipped this quarter will adhere to that new simple model. It will have a base perpetual component. And then the opportunity to up sell into additional features and value using subscription models.","So I expect that all of this effort, the energy, that the simplicity of the model that we've introduced is going to actually help us achieve our long-term projections for security or switching as a component of sales which is up 16% by 2021.","Samik Chatterjee","Okay, great. Thanks for the update. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Notter, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","George Notter","Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the Cloud business. If I go back over the last few quarters we've had lots of conversations about the MX, the PJX transition and you know obviously if I go back that was a big source of erosion in terms of you know, the price realization per gig that you were getting.","And we got the impression that you guys were you know through the meat of that transition. But if I look at the financials here, I mean we're still seeing down I think 18% year on year. It seems like - and you're saying there's capacity growth among that customer set. So it feels like we're still getting pretty significant erosion here. I guess, I was trying to understand you know exactly what the dynamic is. Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yeah. So you're right in that, the bulk of the transition, the product transition is behind us at this point. We're not entirely through it, but we're mostly through it at this point. I think the bigger impact right now is really around the pace and the timing of deployments.","And you know, as painful as the product transition was I do it all over again because it has resulted in us now be holding the footprint that's so important for us, that will event eventually translate to growth and will give us the opportunity to sell into net new footprint.","What I look at - when I look at the cloud space is even though the CapEx spending might moderate, I look at the businesses of our cloud customers and across the boards you see that they are all crushing it, they're doing amazing things with their businesses. And as a result of that they will need to continue to invest in their networks.","I think that eventually helps us in the routing space where we have the strength and it's exceptionally important for us to grow into net new footprint which we're doing, as I mentioned everything we need to do from a technology and engagement standpoint that will enable us to grow.","Going forward the last the last thing I'll just mention is, you know exiting the Q1 period we did see a pick up in momentum that has fed into our confidence that we should see sequential improvement from this Q1 low.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tal Liani, Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Rami Rahim","Hey, Tal. Are you there?","Operator","Tal, your line is now live. Our next question comes from James Fawcett, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","James Fawcett","Yeah. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask really quickly on Mist, we've heard some positive feedback on from channel partners et cetera on that product and you've talked about like hopefully being able to pull that through or use that to pull through other Juniper products into the enterprise et cetera. Do you - I know you're not expecting revenue directly from Mist to contribute much this year, but really ramp in 2020.","But can you talk about like what the time to, I guess training and productivity and how we should think about starting to see evidence of Mist traction and how it can help the rest of the portfolio?","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Thanks for the question James. So first I will re-emphasize that I truly believe that Mist is very unique technology in the industry that brings to bear their AI capabilities, the cloud management, superior visibility and very importantly the scale to capture a very large enterprise customers that other solutions - that are cloud managed just simply don't have the capability of doing.","We are already in the middle of training our broad sales team worldwide to understand how to articulate the value proposition of the product. I personally have been involved in many of the early customer conversations and have heard firsthand the excitement from those customers and I have seen again firsthand how Mist can be used as a door opener that gives us the opportunity to position other products.","So not meaningful from a revenue standpoint in the Q2 period, I do believe that it starts to be meaningful based on net new footprint, based on the capability of our broad sales team, to position the technology, you know, in the latter part of this year and certainly I believe it becomes now accretive to us next year.","And I think it's important to note that I mean, Mist has sold [ph] with the hardware, as well as the software delivered from the cloud, so that software also is going to be recognized ratably over a period of time.","So although the bookings, you know, ones will start to come sooner rather later, the revenue will be drawn out a bit, which is in line with our long-term kind of software subscription model.","James Fawcett","Got it. And thanks for the clarification on recognition, that's helpful. Ken, just a follow up question. Normally I hate to kind of parse guidance and language, but I just want to understand is that - in the first quarter you posted $0.05 of EPS upside, you're saying excluding the impact of taxes and the Mist acquisition that your EPS guidance would remain unchanged for the year.","And it seems like at least, where you're pointing people for revenue, at least for the third quarter is a little bit below where the street is. So I'm just wondering where those deltas, like why they're emerging and what's different maybe then perhaps how at the very least the street had things modeled and kind of what's making for those small changes if you will?","Ken Miller","Yes, I would say kind of at the highest level. Revenue is largely in line with what we expected for the full year. I mean, I do think Q3 - you know I already mentioned I think you bringing that growth rate to 3% makes more sense to me, given the seasonality we normally see in Q3 is a tough quarter for us, but the upside in Q1 somewhat offsets any of the model there.","So I think the full year is largely in line. The biggest change of the year is going to be OpEx, you know, OpEx I do think will be flat to slightly up, whereas before we thought approximately flat, plus or minus, so and now taking flat, plus and that's largely...","James Fawcett","Sorry - sorry just to make clear. So it's flattish, it's flat up slightly up, plus Mist or because of Mist acquisition?","Ken Miller","Because of Mist, because of Mist.","James Fawcett","Right. Right.","Ken Miller","Because of Mist, and that's you know, that's now downs now Juniper, right. So that's now baked into our full year OpEx expectation. The other thing I would mention is tax rate. You know I do think it's going to trend up from last year's levels, it improve from Q1. The tax rate would be a bit of a headwind.","Last but not least, into the ASR timing which pushed, we expect to that in Q1. Now it's going to be done in Q2. We expect we do have some favorableness on the other income line due to interest rate improvement. But those are kind of the puts and takes to the full year EPS guidance.","James Fawcett","That's great. Thank you so much for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Sami Badri","Hi. Thank you. My question really pertains to Juniper legacy Xmas [ph] networks or Mist Systems and more specifically if I look at your customer revenue mixes across enterprise, telecom and cable and cloud and from 1Q 2018 to 4Q '18 you did have a year on year ramp in your revenue growth rate. And as we think about 2019 excluding Mist, do you expect to see a very similar type of ramp going through 2019, as we saw in 2018 mainly driven by enterprises? And maybe I have a follow up after that.","Rami Rahim","Yes. So we absolutely expect sequential growth in revenue throughout this year. Mist, it will be a factor but not the reason. I mean, Mist will be relatively immaterial to the grand scheme of kind of Juniper's size and scale from a revenue perspective, but it should growth as well, but it won't be the driver of the overall growth of Juniper. We expect sequential growth.","Enterprise as the one vertical that we expect full year growth, year-on-year we expect that momentum to continue and actually accelerate as we kind of move through the salesforce transition that we - that we were kind of in the middle of exiting and moving on to more productivity as we're hiring more sales folks.","Cloud NSP, We also expect sequential growth off of Q1 levels and actually off of the Q2 guide, we expect sequential growth.","Sami Badri","Got it. And just to be clear, this is all excluding - is it excluding Mist throughout this ramp, right, the enterprise commentary?","Rami Rahim","Correct. Yes, yes.","Sami Badri","Okay.","Rami Rahim","We view Mist as an accelerator [ph] obviously, I mean, Mist will accelerate our enterprise plan that we had, an organic plan without Mist. We did believe we would grow enterprise.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you. The other follow up. I really have is regarding Mist and dilution now based on how the numbers have actually come about, I guess the dilution dynamic is between $0.5 and $0.15 of dilution from the acquisition. I know you guys can give us a tangible number, but are we on the higher end of this range or in the lower end of this range?","Ken Miller","So that the guide that we gave up prior to Mist was a $1.80, plus or minus 5 and revise that to $1.75, plus or minus five. So about $0.05 is the guide down and that encompasses Mist, as well as some tax rate adjustment, somewhat offset by interest income.","Sami Badri","Got it. And then just this is kind of more thinking like afar [ph] just given the announcement of Mist and as Contrail progresses, but - what would you anticipate the software revenue mix of total revenues probably a year out from today, just given there are a lot of moving pieces and changes occurring in the model, they will kick off 2020. What would be a reasonable mix assume or to shoot for in the model just from software?","Rami Rahim","So we have - we have the target of 16% for 20 21, I expect us to directly grow towards that between now and there. You know, it's not going to be perfectly linear, but I think from a forecasting perspective some sort of linear progression between here and there would be probably the best model.","Jess Lubert","Operator, we're going to take one more question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva, Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much for squeezing me in. I would say the best question for the last, but anyway. Regarding your commentary at the beginning, you mentioned customers are sweating their assets. Typically when that happens there's a certain duration then they absolutely have to come back and they come back feasting and indulging themselves on purchasing orders or something has structurally changed like you know some type of data compression or some type of optimization programs or something.","Can you help us understand is that true in the situation from where you sit and see or has something changed because at some point the sweating cannot continue with the heated assets?","Rami Rahim","So I believe you're referring to the commentary we made around the cloud\u2026","Jim Suva","Correct.","Rami Rahim","Customers essentially running their networks a little hotter.","Jim Suva","Correct.","Rami Rahim","And like I said earlier, when I look at the business performance of our cloud customers, they can't achieve that performance on a continuous basis and deliver the kind of experience that's so important for them to their customers without investing in their networks.","So I - even if spending moderates, I do believe that this remains an incredible opportunity for us and this is why we're investing in it. So yeah, my belief is that cloud is in fact a growth opportunity for Juniper. There might be some ebbs and flows in the business based on deployment cycles, but network investment is going to be required and we're ready to capture that investment with a footprint that we have, as well as the you know all the effort that we're making to capture net new footprint.","Jim Suva","When do you think that will happen, I mean, at some point, I mean, they're just killing it with their you know trends and so it seems like it's got to be sooner or am I wrong with that because your outlook doesn't look like it's coming pretty quick?","Rami Rahim","I think last year you know, we saw a meaningful decline, this year I think we get to stability and then next year I think we can start to get to growth. And I believe that the long term model that we provided for cloud which is growth is absolutely in the cards, especially as we capture net new footprint and new cloud customers worldwide.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much.","Rami Rahim","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I will now turn the call back over to Jess Lubert for closing remarks.","Thank you everyone for your questions. We look forward to speaking and meeting with you during the quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Please keep your questions to one per firm.","With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Kathleen. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered good year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the June quarter. Total revenue was $1.309 billion at the high end of our guidance range, with growth driven by record revenue in Switching and continued strength in the Cloud vertical. We delivered strong profitability metrics, with year-over-year growth in operating margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share. I'm pleased with our overall performance as we continued to benefit from our diversification strategy.","We're executing on our strategy to lead the transformation to the cloud, and I'm happy with the continued strength in our cloud-oriented solution across our key focus verticals. Enterprises continued towards digital transformation by adopting hybrid cloud and SaaS models.","Top of mind for many of our customers are security and visibility of data and workloads in a multi-cloud environment. Telcos are going through a significant transformation as trends such as SD-WAN, 5G, IoT, and overall broadband growth are driving the need to evaluate Cloud-grade architectural shift in order to increase automation, reduce costs and enable greater service speed and agility.","In the quarter, we unveiled Cloud-Grade Networking to accelerate agility and innovation in the cloud era. Cloud-Grade Networking builds on carrier-grade reach and reliability and enterprise-grade control and usability, bringing cloud-level agility and operational scale to networks everywhere.","This announcement includes two new foundational products: Junos Node Slicing and Universal Chassis, which reduce operational overhead and create an environment for operational agility to thrive. Junos Node Slicing is a critical technology in the transition to Cloud-Grade Networking and in particular, the movement to disaggregated networking at the edge. By enabling the ability to run multiple isolated services at the edge, combined with a powerful and efficient data plane, service providers and enterprises can optimize their infrastructure while offering differentiated services with enhanced operational and administrative isolation within a single chassis.","This is enabled by converging multiple concurrent services on the same physical routing infrastructure. This differentiated technology has already enabled a Tier 1 service provider network win for us, and we expect that we'll have broader impact as our customers learn about its powerful benefits.","Universal Chassis is a breakthrough system allowing customers to standardize on a hardware platform across their data center, core and network edge. It is designed to provide customers with the ability to adapt to ever changing business requirements with a common hardware platform that supports a continuum of optimized switching and routing use cases across their network. Universal Chassis can create significant value for our customers by enhancing their ROI through reduced qualification and logistics cost along with greater investment protection.","Now, I would like to summarize the highlights across Switching, Routing and Security. In Switching, we saw continued momentum with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth across all verticals. Two effects continued to see strong year-over-year growth in cloud data center, driven by the industry's migration towards 100-gigabit infrastructure and as our customers adopt end-to-end solutions with Juniper's ToR and spine portfolio. We also saw year-over-year and sequential growth in our EX products.","In Routing, the MX had good year-over-year and sequential growth. And we also saw strength in our PTX products within our cloud customers and new insertions in telecom in the second quarter.","In Security, we announced enhancements to our Software-Defined Secure Networks platform and expanded our public cloud offering with the introduction of virtual SRX 4.0. Our SDSN enhancements deliver pervasive security across multivendor environments, public clouds and private cloud.","Juniper's SDSN platform and its ecosystem help organizations unify security for their networks, giving customers a streamlined way to integrate products and manage their security operation regardless of the vendors they choose.","In addition, we continue to add new logos to our Sky ATP customer portfolio. In the quarter, we continued to see momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins, including a large Strategic Enterprise customer in APAC and a large telecom customer in EMEA.","AppFormix and Contrail have been integrated for seamless operations management of Juniper's hardware and software. This allows us to bring the powerful machine-learning capabilities of AppFormix to our entire portfolio of products, and we are now applying this capability in various customer use cases.","We had another strong quarter in our services business, where we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services.","To summarize, I'm pleased with our execution and the continued momentum we are seeing in our Cloud vertical and our Switching business. I am proud of the strength in our product and services portfolio and excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. We saw good momentum in the first half of the year, and we anticipate delivering revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth for the full year.","I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I also wanted to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to successfully execute on our strategy and create value for all of our stakeholders.","I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the second quarter of 2017 reflect good sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, continued expansion of earnings and healthy cash flows. The industry shift towards cloud networking continued to play to our strengths. The Cloud vertical grew 32% year-over-year, and from a product perspective, we had a record revenue quarter in Switching led by the QFX product family. In addition, our Services business remained solid, posting 9% year-over-year growth, driven by continued strong renewal and attach rates.","In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Telecom or Cable, and one was a Strategic Enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. These revenue results reflect the focus and dedication we have made toward diversification of our revenue across technologies, markets and geographies.","Moving on to non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP product gross margin was down year-over-year primarily due to three factors. First, customer mix as we continued to expand our footprint with certain strategic customers, particularly with cloud and telecom customers in Asia Pac. Second, product mix, primarily related to the strong performance of Switching. And finally, as expected, the higher cost for certain memory components.","We continue to see year-over-year strength in non-GAAP service gross margin due to higher service revenue and continued improvements in our customer support model. For the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $496 million, reflecting our continued discipline around operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased $0.07 year-over-year, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by lower gross margin.","I am pleased with the healthy cash flow from operations in the quarter of $299 million, which brings our first half cash flow from operations to $844 million. DSO was 52 days, reflecting a return to normalized invoicing linearity. We continue to return capital to shareholders, and during the second quarter, we repurchased $125 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends.","Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. We remain committed to the financial principles we outlined at the beginning of the year, which are: we expect revenue growth for the year, we are focused on earnings expansion with long-term consistency, and intend to maintain an optimized capital structure. In addition, we remain committed to delivering strong operating cash flow.","We continue to expect revenue growth for 2017 to be near the midpoint of our long-term model range of 3% to 6%. As I shared with you last quarter, some elements of our addressable markets are challenged, and timing of customer deployments may vary. We are pleased with our product portfolio and expect to see continued strength from the Cloud vertical. For the remainder of 2017, we expect similar gross margin dynamics as seen in the first half of the year. We are focused on driving non-GAAP earnings expansion for the full year through revenue growth, operating expense discipline and strong execution.","As we stated last quarter, we are driving to our long-term model of 39% of non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year. We intend to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow to our shareholders inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.","Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and answer session. Our first question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Ken, if I could just on the Switching strength in gross margins, just talk a little bit about what it would take to get those a little bit more towards the corporate gross margin levels. There are some switch companies that are at these levels for their product gross margins. So is it scale? Is there something else that needs to happen? Do we need to see more software features? If you could just talk a little bit about how we can see Switching maybe over time become less of a drag to the corporate gross margin. Thank you.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure. So, yeah, as we mentioned the product mix to Switching has had a drag on the overall gross margin. Clearly Switching continues to outpace our long-term model expectations. And while the over-performance is having a positive effect on gross profit and overall earnings, it does have a minor impact in our margin. As far as getting the margins up, it's like all of our products, continuing to innovate, continuing to sell that innovation, continuing to focus on cost, is what \u2013 designing for cost, designing for value initiatives, as well as just making sure that we focus on what matters to our customers from a product differentiation perspective.","I do think there will be more and more service \u2013 sorry, software attach within all of our product lines including Switching. So that should also provide some tailwinds for the Switching business going forward.","Last but not least, I would say even with these kind of margin (15:05) dynamic that we're seeing, we're very focused on overall growth, profit expansion and earnings expansion. I'm very pleased that we're able to deliver that in the first half and Q2.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, hi, guys, thanks for the question. I just had I guess a couple of questions for you. One is on the growth rate that you're suggesting for the full year and then Q3. Just looking at the Cloud, Telecom and Enterprise verticals and thinking about the trajectory of growth in all of those, it seems like you're implying a pretty material slowdown on a year-over-year basis in one or a couple of those. So I just wonder if you could give us a little bit of color on what you're thinking in terms of growth for those sub-segments that you've been starting to report. And then the second question I had was on gross margin. Can you just give us maybe, Ken, a little bit of an understanding of those three elements that you listed out on what their impact was quantitatively? Particularly, interested in memory price impacts on gross margin. Thanks.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure. Good.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Actually, Rod, let me start. And then Ken, why don't you weigh in? So on the first question around growth, goes without saying we're pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year. We're off to a strong start for 2017. It certainly gives us confidence that we can meet our objective of achieving revenue growth and earnings growth in 2017 all up.","Having said that, with respect to the specific verticals, remain optimistic about Cloud vertical. A lot of focus inside the company at maintaining the momentum in the Cloud. However, we've always said that the Cloud vertical is going to have some lumpiness. There's going to be a timing of deployment factor that we need to weigh into our overall outlook on a quarter-over-quarter basis.","Telco, it's going to be more of the same. I think nothing really changes all that much either in the positive or the negative direction. The engagement level with our telco customers is very high. And it's all very much around new architectures, new ways of driving service revenues, et cetera. But the new mode of operation, the new build-out that drive these new modes of service delivery are just going to take some time. So we're not expecting anything materially different in the short term.","Enterprise, there actually in Q2, we saw some good momentum with the exception of the federal government. And there, we have to see how the federal government spending plays out for the rest of the year. But generally speaking, we've done a good job in compensating for weakness in federal government with the broader enterprise. So all up, we remain optimistic about the year, and we're off to a solid start in achieving both revenue and margin growth for the full year. Go ahead, Ken.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","I'll touch on gross margin, but before I do, I just want to talk about federal government for a second. It was up sequentially. We did see year-on-year decline in federal government. So Rami's comments about the broad enterprise really carrying the day from a year-on-year perspective is spot on. But we did see some sequential growth in the federal government space in Q2.","On a gross margin perspective, the three factors that we outlined last quarter are the same three factors this quarter. It really is customer mix, as we expand our footprint with certain strategic customers, particularly in telco, cloud in Asia Pac region. The second one being product mix, as I already talked about the Switching being a very profitable business for us. Obviously, we're very pleased with the performance of that technology. It does come with a slight drag to the margin percentage. And last but not least was the DRAM memory pricing, you mentioned, Rod.","We don't break out the exact specifics, but I can say that all three were relatively proportionate and they're kind of factors as headwinds to margin. The one that was probably a bigger headwind than we anticipated when we set the midpoint of the guidance, the one that's the reason why we're on the low end of the guidance, if you will, would be the customer mix. We definitely saw some opportunity to take down some deals, expand our footprint in certain parts of the world that we think are going to be in the long term best interests of the company. And given that we're able to deliver the revenue and earnings expansion that we were focused on, we went ahead and did that in Q2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to get one quick clarification and then more of a general thematic question. In terms of my \u2013 the thing I want to clarify is it appears you've given us implied Q4 guidance, since we have Q3 and a full year bogey at sort of the midpoint at 3% to 6% range. And that would imply that Q4, we would see perhaps a slight year-over-year decline in revenue of 1% or 2%. I just want to make sure I'm doing my math correctly. And if so, it would really help us get an understanding of why you see that kind of year-over-year deceleration.","In terms of a more thematic question, I want to delve a little bit into the longer-term trends of Routing. This quarter was relatively flat year-over-year. And it does appear that within your mix, that 2017 Routing is probably going to decline overall and was a little flat \u2013 or roughly flat in 2016. When do you expect the routing market for you and for your headers to turn more sustainably positive and begin to grow again, because we believe traffic continues to grow? Could you help us understand that longer term trend in Routing as well? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure, Simon. I'll start with the question about Routing. And then we'll address the first question or the point of clarification you're asking about. The routing market is largely driven by the Telco vertical and the Cloud vertical. And those are a little bit of a tale of two cities right now where the Cloud is really spending quite a bit on their wide area networks, making sure that their customers for their Cloud services continue to get the optimal experience. And that involves investments in their wide area network. That's somewhat offset by weakness in the Telco vertical, all up, which is obviously significant factor in Routing.","So yes, traffic is growing. But there are sort of other factors at play that results in Routing from a revenue standpoint or total addressable market standpoint not growing all that well. Having said that, I think that there are some things that are going to be happening at some point in the future around metro buildouts, around new modes of delivering services to enterprises that leverage things like new Cloud-managed solutions to connectivity and security that we are very much engaging with our customers on today, difficult to tell exactly when that will result in actual revenue growth for us. But that said, we're doing everything we can right now to participate in those new modes of spend when they become a reality in the market.","The last thing I would say about Routing is there is a big geographic component to this. China is a country that's still investing quite heavily in routing today. They're driving a lot of the world's sort of wide area traffic growth. And in order for us to participate effectively in that market beyond the level that we are today, we need partnerships. And there is a, as you know, quite a bit of focus right now by the company on creating partnerships such as the one that we have with Lenovo today, that will enable us to tap into that market as effectively as possible.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes, from a second half revenue perspective, as you know, our revenue is largely deployment based, and therefore, it tends to be pretty lumpy. We did provide specific guidance for Q3 at $1.320 billion, which is up approximately 3% year-on-year. We did not provide Q4 guidance as you mentioned, but we did reiterate that we expect to be within our range, and in fact, near the midpoint of that range. I will say Q4, we expect clearly to be sequentially up. We did have a strong first half this year and we had a pretty strong second half last year. So the year-on-year growth rates, I would expect to decelerate in the second half as compared to second half of 2016. But I do still expect sequential growth and to be comfortably within our target of 3% to 6% kind of near that midpoint area.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Yes. I just wanted to follow-up on that last point. So as you mentioned, Ken, you did reiterate the full year guidance at the midpoint, which implies Q4 revenue down 1.5%. And given that just the growth in services alone is going to get you a couple of points of growth for the company as a whole, it does imply a more significant year-over-year decline in products revenue in Q4.","So I guess the question is, is that just conservatism sitting here today in July? Or do you have specific visibility into that quarter? And then the quick other question I had is, as far as your 10% customer, if you can tell us what vertical that customer was in? Thank you.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes, I wouldn't characterize it as conservatism, I would characterize it as appropriate. There's a lot of factors to go into our guidance, clearly deal visibility, backlog, deferred revenue, et cetera. And I would also reiterate that we said near the midpoint, so between 3% to 6% is our long-term target. We expect to be near the midpoint. And I still think that will hold true going into Q3 and Q4 when we get to the full year of near midpoint.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","And just to add some color on the first question, Simona, I appreciate the question. Juniper has always been a company that has derived much of its success by focusing on those that operate the world's largest, most scalable networks. And that's certainly true for our service provider on our Cloud vertical.","So, in some sense, due to reasons of strategy where we're focusing as a company, where our strengths lie, and the concentration of where spend is happening in our industry, concentration in our business is not new. I think the timing of deployments just so happened that resulted in a little bit more concentration than usual in the Q3 timeframe. I'm not prepared at this point to provide any additional details just for reasons of confidentiality about the specific customer though however.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you hear me? My question is kind of around the question that we had before. How much of the conservatism in 3Q and 4Q, or maybe 4Q, is related to lower visibility with the big trends that you had in the past few quarters? If I look at the past few quarters, I can generally characterize it by quarters of strong Security \u2013 sorry, strong Switching, sorry, strong Switching and strong Cloud vertical. If you're guiding for Q2 to be down, or implicit guidance, does it mean that you have less confidence with these two big drivers? And can you elaborate on the sustainability of growth trends within these two drivers? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","So, Tal, I appreciate the question. We're just off to a really solid start this year. I think, as you saw in the Q2 timeframe, we sort of hit the high end of our revenue range. Part of that had to do with sort of just timing of deployments of big projects that we have been working on. There is no change to our confidence in terms of our strategy, our ability to execute, our products that we have in the market today and the products that we're working on that we know that will be out in the market in the future. And also our vertical focus, so the Cloud vertical continues to be a really important vertical for us. I don't think that there's going to be any material slowdown in terms of their need to invest in their networks to keep ahead of the traffic that they are seeing on a yearly basis. But we just have to factor into all of this the timing of those deployments and the timing of the projects.","And I think you also mentioned Switching. Obviously very happy with the Switching performance that we have demonstrated well ahead of our long-term model. I think we've said in the past, and I'll say it again just now, that expecting that level of ongoing outperformance at Switching is probably unrealistic only because the numbers start to get big. But that said, the new products are doing really well. Our customer adoption is excellent. The feedback that we're getting from our customers and our partners is also very, very encouraging and there is a lot more room for us to grow and take market share in the Switching business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Rami, I was hoping you could help us understand the breadth of the strength you're seeing with the QFX and particularly, the spine portfolio, and perhaps how you're feeling about the sustainability of the trends we've seen the last few quarters. And would you expect Switching to grow sequentially through the year?","And then for Ken, I was hoping you could maybe comment to what degree your cost structure changes as the cloud becomes a bigger piece of your mix. And perhaps, what gives you confidence you can continue to grow the business over time while only marginally increasing the pace of investment? And to the extent you do need to spend a little bit more, where do you see the greatest priorities?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure, Jeff. Let me start. On the question around Switching, we have expected and we have seen that Switching is in fact the main growth driver for the business. I expect that to continue with the comment I just mentioned around the fact that expecting these levels of outperformance relative to our long-term model in Switching to \u2013 at some point they're going to moderate. But that said, that's not a comment at all that I think you should take that would demonstrate a lack of confidence in the product, the technology and the market focus. All of that I would say is working really, really well for us right now.","And on the point around spine switches, the main intent of our spine switching products has been to enable us to participate in and compete for net new Switching business, especially in the data center. And that's exactly what they're doing. So even in opportunities where we're coming in with the spine switches and, of course, our top of racks, the bulk of the revenue that we'd see could be in other areas of our portfolio like in the top-of-rack switching but we would not have an ability to compete or to win without the breadth of that portfolio. So it's as expected and we're very pleased with the momentum thus far. And I think it will continue in terms of being a growth driver for us for the rest of the year and for the foreseeable future.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. And as it relates to the cost structure, as the shift to the cloud momentum continues, I would say, I mean, the first thing I'll note is we have a highly leveraged R&D organization. So Routing, Switching and Security is highly leveraged across most of our engineers and what they bring to market in those areas. We'll continue that leverage and the cloud is really \u2013 as we deliver products to the cloud, it should be right in our sweet spot of Routing, Switching and Security. So there's a tremendous amount of leverage there.","From a go-to-market perspective, we already have, as you can see from the results, a very successful strategy in winning with the cloud providers and the go-to-market coverage model there is actually quite efficient as compared to, let's say, a broad channel coverage model as an example. So that's something that we'll continue to see going forward.","From a, would will we invest more, I mean, there's a lot of areas, a lot of emerging technology areas that we're continuing to invest in now. And I could see that investment step up over the years as we continue to evolve into new architectures, new kind of software areas of focus that we've been talking about for quite some time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about product cycle. I know that in late June you launched your Cloud-Grade Networking platforms. I'm just curious of how we should think about the cadence of that product cycle? And when do you believe and how material do you believe that product cycle should be maybe looking out over the next couple of quarters?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, Aaron. Let me address that. So Cloud-Grade Networking includes a number of different sub-products. One of them is really around this concept of a Universal Chassis. Ken just talked about how we as a company are operating and executing with far more efficiency. It's true in our engineering group, it's true in other parts of our organization as well. Well, one of the ways in which we're achieving that is by developing fewer products that address a broader market opportunity. This concept of a Universal Chassis has the ability to address a number of routing or switching use cases. And it adds tremendous value for our customers because it gives them an ability to evolve their deployments, their investment protection to address a variety of different use cases as their business requires it.","The Universal Chassis, the first iteration of it is in the market today. It's a product that supports both routing and switching, and eventually will also support edge routing capabilities as opposed to just core routing capabilities. And while it's still early, typically these things take a couple of quarters, maybe nine months to get to revenue, I do expect revenue for this first iteration of Universal Chassis in the second half of this year.","And of course, the innovation engine continues to crank. So across Routing, Switching and Security, you can expect that there's going to be a number of new products that will continue this ongoing cycle of refreshes, and of course that will help us in maintaining the momentum that we've seen thus far over the last couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I have a couple a (34:49-34:56)...","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Hey, James, you're cutting in and out. We can barely hear you.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Is that better?","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes, much. Thank you.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just had a couple of higher-level strategic questions. First, with the appointment of Bikash Koley as CTO, clearly it seems to be enhancing Juniper's Cloud and hyperscale chops, if you will. So I'm just wondering what you hope that Mr. Koley and his leadership will bring to improve like the product portfolio for your traditional Telecom and Enterprise customers.","And I guess along the same lines of long-term view, you've talked recently about how you're modifying your Security portfolio. But we've started to see a lot of the private security assets that are in the market snapped up, and with your capital return coming in, I was just wondering if you expect to have to be able to do everything internally or if you still think there's room to acquire new technologies and teams as you continue to develop your security capabilities. Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks, James, both good questions. First on the appointment of Bikash Koley as CTO, very, very happy with this hire. Just as a reminder, Bikash hasn't actually joined us yet, but we anticipate that he will in the next month. What he brings to the table are a number of different things, but I'll just sort of summarize it in a couple of different ways. First and foremost, you know that we have over the last couple of years, really honed in our strategy on what we believe is the biggest trend that is impacting our industry. And that is the Cloud. It's by no means saying that this means that it's just around the hyperscalers or the cloud operators. Cloud is in fact an architectural evolution that's becoming a way of life across every vertical that we participate in today. And all of our customers in these verticals, whether they be Telco, Cable, Enterprises, government and of course the hyperscalers are looking for real leadership from a product direction, from a services direction that helps them to make this transition to a cloud architecture that helps them become far more agile and to save money, just as the hyperscale providers have demonstrated can be possible. And of course, Bikash has been a part of that at his current employer, Google.","Secondarily, I believe and I've always believed that having real technical knowledge, not just in the products themselves, but in the operation of products and the operations of networks, allow you to develop better solutions for your customers. And Bikash has that as well. I mean, he has now spent a number of years running what is a large network. And that knowhow helps us in developing better solutions, I think, for all of our customer base.","Moving on to the question around Security, so yes, we would look to both organic or inorganic. But quite frankly, the focus right now on Security has been on achieving stability and returning to growth. And that means a lot of organic work execution that's necessary to turn around this part of our business. We continue to enhance our product offering with recent emphasis on the enterprise and the mid-range where we actually start \u2013 have started to see some momentum. We are getting positive data points from customers, from partners. We're seeing some geo specific momentum so, whereas, EMEA was a bit of a challenge for us in the Q2 timeframe. Actually there was momentum in Security in EMEA, which gives us some confidence that we're innovating in the right way.","And very importantly, Security has become a critical element of some of these future modes of engagements with our customers. So as we talk to our customers around SD-WAN, for example, one of the really differentiating attributes of our SD-WAN solution is that it has Security embedded. So while we're starting to win opportunities in the SD-WAN space, we haven't yet seen the revenue that will help the Security number, which I anticipate we will start to see in the future.","Once we get the stability, I think, yeah, there is certainly a possibility for us to start to look at inorganic approaches to accelerate the momentum in our business. But we're taking a deliberate, methodical approach right now to this part of our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I did want to return back a little bit to the strategic angle, because I think this is the first time in a while when the net cash balance has gone up three times in a row. So it seems like you have quite a lot of flexibility to go after a new asset. So I'm obviously not looking for names here, but can you maybe talk about what type of technology you guys would be interested in at this point?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Well, so if you look at \u2013 what we've done just historically, we've made a couple of acquisitions in the optical space. We believe there is an architectural inflection point where customers can achieve vast levels of cost efficiency by managing and operating their networks across packet and optical. And then the last one was a company called AppFormix, which is around automation, in particular, in the cloud data center, but has much broader applicability than that. And that would be sort of indicative of what you might expect in the future as well.","I just mentioned Security. Even in the domain of Security, I think any sort of inorganic activity that we would contemplate or explore would be more around the new modes of security, not so much of around sort of the physical perimeter firewall which is current mode. New mode is around enabling customers to migrate to public clouds or to hybrid cloud offerings without compromising their data, their users, their workloads. I think, there's quite a bit of innovation right now in the industry in that domain and that would be an area that we would consider as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to build off of the Cloud theme throughout the earlier questions, in terms of understanding dual sourcing. Do you think that Juniper is benefiting from just the general tide rising? Or are you seeing clouds now articulate their dual sourcing or even triple sourcing of certain product? And then, kind of the offshoot of that question is, is your Security portfolio as it stands today, kind of, building off of James's question, is it inhibiting any sort of further penetration at certain cloud accounts because of holes in the portfolio? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Mark, first, I want to understand a little bit more about your first question. When you say dual sourcing, are you talking about the intent of cloud providers to dual source their...","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Two vendors.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","To have, yeah...","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The dual vendors, dual \u2013 two vendors.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes. I mean, the Cloud vertical for us is not a new vertical. I mean, we have been in this vertical now for as long as I can remember. And we have been, sort of, intimately tied down at the engineering level with our cloud customers now for a number of years. And it's always been a very competitive environment. So, by no means do I ever feel like there \u2013 that we don't need to be on our toes.","We're always having to demonstrate to them how we're innovating in ways that are very, very specific to the kinds of network that they're building out, the operational models that they want to deploy, the telemetry capabilities that they want, et cetera, et cetera. And yeah, some of them do have sort of an internal strategy to go to dual vendor \u2013 dual vendors to procure that technology. But even in those circumstances, our goal is to always get the lion's share by demonstrating that we can perform better or innovate in a more appropriate way for their business.","On Security, and I think, the question was around whether we're driving Security products in the Cloud vertical. And that certainly is the case, but I will say that different cloud providers have very different security requirements and security models that they deploy inside of their networks. In some cases, they believe in the big iron that sits at the edge of their data centers, for example, and secures traffic going in and out of those data centers.","For that, we have a fantastic product, our high-end SRX. But that business will be very lumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on where the deployments are. In other cases, it's really more around securing through micro segmentation inside of the cloud network. And that's really more around a software approach to security, and that's more of an emerging opportunity for us at Juniper.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. I just want to clarify what's the thinking on gross margins. What's the confidence that for the corporate levels that we're at a floor for the long term here (45:02)? Apart from software rising in the mix, the product mix that's going on, what other factors should we think about? I think 62% (45:09) do you think, or are there other factors to think about over the next 12 months? Thanks.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So we did, obviously, guidance for Q3 at 62.0%, plus or minus 0.5 point. For the full year, I still expect the gross margin to be in that 62% to 63% range that we talked about on the last call. That's really the line what we expect, and we still continue to focus on earnings expansion. And I expect earnings to expand actually at a faster rate than revenue for FY 2017. So that's something we're very focused on for this year, kind of, despite some of the gross margin headwinds that we're seeing.","From a longer term, I'm not going to provide guidance beyond this year, but I will say that there's a tremendous amount of focus internally on gross margin. Clearly, it all starts with the right product and innovation and product differentiation. And that's something that Juniper really has historically been our strong suit and that will continue to be our strong suit going forward. So making sure we provide the right products at the right price point is something we'll continue to drive.","There's opportunity within our cost structure, we've been working on it for the last couple of years, but I still think there's some opportunity to get our cost structure down particularly in the area of designing for value, making sure that we're spending some of our technical resource on not just features and performance, but also some of the cost drivers that matter to our customers today.","And last but not least is the software business, which we mentioned on multiple times. In addition to all this focus on gross margin, we're going to continue to be very focused on OpEx management and overall profitability and that's really what's driving a lot of our business decisions today.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Maybe, Kulbinder, it's worthwhile just summarizing the areas of focus that we currently have with respect to gross margins. First, there is opportunity when it comes to value engineering. And there is a concerted effort right now in the company to optimize our products for cost of goods sold in a way that will help gross margins.","Secondarily, I mean, Ken has mentioned how we've gone after strategic customer insertions in particular in APAC, and we need those to pay off over time.","Third, there's innovation. And one of the questions I was just asked around where are you contemplating inorganic moves, one area I did not mention is the area of silicon photonics. The primary reason is because we believe that there is an opportunity there through innovation to achieve better cost of goods sold from an optical standpoint.","And last but not least, it's around business models and it's around software. It's around selling the value through Contrail, virtual security, SD-WAN. All of these emerging opportunities I think have the ability to not just help top line, but to also help gross margins. But they're largely going to be gated by how fast the industry moves. Now, we're out there sort of really selling the value to our customers. We're encouraged by the wins that we're getting, but it's sort of the timing of the benefit is not 100% clear at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much. I know gross margins has been a key topic, and I think that's because investors are so focused on the year-over-year declines, yet the revenues increases. So revenue's going up which is great. Margin's coming down and is a concern for investors. So I have two questions, one on that and then one just on the Security side. So on the gross margins, are we at a level now where gross margins are going to stop going lower or is it more mix-dependent and they potentially could go lower strategically as you look forward to the future? And I do understand the three things you laid out, but I'm just kind of thinking about this bigger picture.","Then my second question is on Security, it was down 12% year-over-year. You laid out some (49:17). How should we think about security going forward? Should we kind of expect that to decline going forward until those holes are plugged? Or why are revenues growing yet your Security is declining? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Jim, let me start with the Security question first. So, I outlined the main areas of focus. I also provided some of the data points that we are now picking up on that give us some confidence that the work that we are putting in is going to pay off for us. I believe the second half and in particular Q4 would be sort of a quarter that I would expect to start seeing some year-over-year growth in the security market. So that's how I view the opportunity right now in Security and how we are expecting the rest of year to pan out. And Ken, do you want to talk a little bit more about gross margins?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. So as you mentioned, Jim, there's a balance that we're trying to achieve here. So clearly, revenue growth is one of our highlights for the first half. We were up 9% for the first half, 7% for Q2, 11% for Q1. That did come at a gross margin decrement, but overall, we're growing gross profits. And gross profits really lead to earnings expansion, and that's really where we're focusing as a company. We had very strong earnings expansion in the first half, and I continue to see earnings expansion for the full year.","From a where is margin headed, we did talk about 62% for Q3 guidance, because we expect similar dynamics that we saw in Q2 to persist in Q3. And since the revenue levels are similar, we'd expect the margin levels to also be kind of similar in that range. Beyond that, we've already mentioned all the initiatives to work on gross profit going forward and gross margin going forward, but we aren't providing any guidance beyond the FY 2017 kind of color that we've already provided. It's hard to say \u2013 given the dynamic nature, it's really difficult to have visibility into gross margins beyond kind of the next couple of quarters at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. At the risk of never being allowed back in the queue, I've got a couple of questions for you. One, I appreciate all the questions with gross margin, but I've got a very simple question. What is the rate of price erosion year-over-year all in?","Secondly, within the Cloud, and I appreciate the mix you've been giving on customers, but within the Cloud segment, can you talk about the mix between Tier 1 cloud titans versus the bulk of the cloud, and also the product mix within Cloud?","And finally, the exact 2H, where 2H falls out for the year in terms of revenue, how much of that second half dollars is (52:09) influenced by that 10% customer or I assume somewhat lumpy nature of cloud projects in general? I appreciate it. Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay. Paul, let me start with the second one, the Tier 1 versus broader Cloud. We don't break it out, first of all, but I will say the following. Our penetration in the Tier 1s from a Routing standpoint is one that has been in place now for a number of years. So we've certainly had way more runway and way more of an ability to achieve the kinds of penetration across our Tier 1 Cloud customers in the Routing space more so than we've had on the Switching side of things.","In Switching, we view it as more of an opportunity. We certainly have a strong Tier 1 presence in Switching, but we have less market share and penetration than we do in Routing. And, therefore, that's certainly a potential growth area for us.","In the meantime, I think what I have said on this call in the past is that there is a broader opportunity in the cloud space, not necessarily with the hyperscalers, but the broader cloud market when you look at SaaS providers, regional cloud providers, telco cloud that's here now that we are benefiting from. I mean, a lot of our business momentum in fact is from that tier of cloud provider. And I think that's a very healthy thing.","Price erosion, again, is not something that is easy to describe without a whiteboard and some slides. We can certainly do something like that maybe at our next Analyst Day. But it's the nature of this business that we're in. Every time a new port speed is introduced into the market, as it achieves mass adoption, you will expect, as we would do, that pricing will start to go down and it offsets the benefit that you would get from the traffic growth alone in the market.","So all up, the Routing space is roughly a sort of a flattish type of total addressable market from a growth standpoint, but traffic is growing at 40% plus year-over-year. So that would give you an idea of the price erosion that we're seeing in that market space.","In the data center switching side, there of course, there is price erosion just as there is everywhere. However, I think that market is growing at a faster clip than in the data center and that's why we are so focused on data center switching as part of our strategy.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, and I think you also asked about within the Cloud vertical, the product mix dynamics. And while we don't break out specific products within customer vertical, we have mentioned in the past that the Cloud vertical does have a higher proportion of Switching than say the Telco vertical. That said, it still is predominantly majority of the Cloud vertical is Routing, as most of our revenue is coming from Routing and that applies to the Cloud vertical as well, but we are seeing Switching become a bigger and bigger piece of that overall vertical historically and I think that will continue going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Cisco had some pretty big announcements recently, which I'm assuming you guys looked at and I realize a lot of them are on the campus side, which doesn't affect you. But they did talk about going much more after some of the hyperscalers and having some initial success. They talked about intent-based networking and encryption. I just wondered, kind of, what your analysis is of their products in terms of how perhaps they affect you, both on the positive and the negative side.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Steve. First from the standpoint of hyperscalers, I think we acknowledge that this is a competitive market and especially as we demonstrate the momentum and the success, we can expect that the competitive levels to only intensify. Having said that, I think it really is just a matter of execution for us, execution from the standpoint of how we engage with them, execution from the standpoint of our innovations and on all fronts, I feel good about where we are and where we're going relative to the hyperscaler opportunity, in addition to the broad Cloud opportunity that is before us.","And as far as Cisco's announcement, I have been now for two or three years talking about automation as being the next big thing in networking. There's a very important reason for that. If you think about what our customers across every vertical want more than anything else, it is the ability to move fast, to innovate quickly and to do so with a certain level of cost efficiency. You achieve that by first, providing them with innovative Routing, Switching, and Security products that outpace Moore's Law from an economics of traffic movement standpoint. But importantly, considering that most of our customers invest far more in the cost of operations than they do in CapEx, the only way to address that problem is through automation.","And for that reason, we've always had a lot of automation capabilities across our platforms, whether it be the automation capabilities of our systems themselves, the API driven nature of those systems, Contrail has a way of automating Cloud operation, AppFormix has an ability to provide machine learning capabilities to create visibility inside of a Cloud data center, our NorthStar Controller is essentially an automation platform for our wide area. So I think it's good to see our peers in the industry recognize the importance of this trend, and it has been and will continue to be a huge area of focus for us.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you very much. I was hoping to stick with Switching a little bit. I think in the past, you have given us some QFX growth rates as a standalone product family. So I'm wondering if that's feasible and then if you could talk around the dynamics if that's shifting at all and what we should expect going forward.","Then the second piece is, EX does end up in some campus environments and that has been up. So, please, help us understand if you think that's sustainable, and that's particularly in light of Cisco's Refresh. Is that likely to impact what you all have going on? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. I appreciate the question. In Switching, this is pretty consistent with what we've done historically. We don't necessarily break out the performance of all of our specific product lines. And we didn't do that for QFX in Q2. However, I think it's safe to say that we would not be able to post this type of overall Switching momentum without strong QFX performance. So we're very happy with the performance of our QFX product line in the Q2 timeframe. It's a result of a deliberate strategy and some really solid execution by the team, which I am very proud of.","EX is more of a campus-focus product, although it does see some data center and combined campus data center type of converged build-outs. And we saw good momentum there in the Q2 timeframe as well. Our primary strategy is on the data center, the Cloud, and these larger enterprises that are building out their campuses as on ramps to the Cloud. And for that, you need a high degree of performance, operational simplicity and automation and I think the EX from all three of those dimensions is an extremely competitive product.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Karen. Thank you all for your great questions. As always I want to thank you for those of you who kept your questions to one per firm. For those who didn't, maybe Paul Silverstein, we will talk with you next quarter. Thanks, bye.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Here on the call are Shaygan Kheradpir, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer. Also with us is Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Juniper Development and Innovation, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please remember when listening to today\u2019s call that statements concerning Juniper\u2019s business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and major customers, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, rapid technological and market change, litigation, the potential impact of activities related to the execution of Juniper\u2019s integrated operating plan, and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC.","All statements made during this call are made only as of today.

For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. Please note that today\u2019s call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Shaygan.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thanks Kathleen, and welcome everyone. I am pleased to report that Juniper had another solid quarter, delivering on the upper end of our guidance. On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue 7% and expanded our non-GAAP earnings per share by 38%. Our revenue was well diversified across our target verticals including carriers, Web 2.0, cable and financial services and across all geographies.","We're seeing good trends in U.S. federal aided by more stable market environment and government budgets normalizing after a protected period of constraint. We delivered good performance across our routing and switching product lines, both of which grew year-over-year. I am particularly pleased with our routing performance which grew 7% year-over-year and if normalized for last year's deferred revenue recognition of $34 million, grew 14% year-over-year.","Our highlights include switching growth of 25% and continued customer transaction of Contrail SDN. While overall security was down Junos Space SRX products delivered good year-over-year growth of 9%. All-in-all, a very good performance for the June quarter. Since the last earnings call, I have been on a whirlwind tour meeting with over 70 customers and partners. They are all enthusiastic about our strategy to be the leading provider of High-IQ networks and best in class cloud builder.","What\u2019s really resonating is our approach of listening and understanding in a deep way to the particular business imperative and linking them to Juniper\u2019s out of the possible innovation. Parts of our renewed focus aligns our efforts across our go-to-market and R&D organizations by taking a deliberate used case driven approach to helping our customers deliver innovation that matters to their customers and operations.","While our strategy is clearly resonating with our customers, there are some specific, customer specific dynamics in the near-term that we are factoring into our outlook. Specifically, within U.S. based service providers, their market dynamics including M&A activity are impacting, both sequencing and timing of projects.","While this will impact our near-term outlook, we are well positioned with these customers with major design wins in key areas of their network including next generation projects. Despite the current near-term uncertainty, there are number of positives. First, we expect continued strong growth in our Web 2.0, cable and federal customers; second, EMEA is showing positive momentum with customers continuing to build out their network capacity; third, we are seeing good performance out of our enterprise sector. I am very confident that our market position is strengthening and our momentum in winning new business and new customer logos over the medium and the long-term is strong.","Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the four pillars of our Integrated Operating Plan. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to our commitments and I'm pleased with our progress. ","First, we pivoted our strategy towards growth areas of the market centered on cloud building and High-IQ networking. And we deliberately aligned our resources and partner ecosystem to customers in defined verticals that are in a build cycle for these growth areas. We are seeing clear signs of success as well as an increasingly diverse customer set. For example, three of our top five customers this quarter are either Web 2.0 or cable companies.","Second, we successfully implemented to organizational structure required to drive our strategy. By streamlining the company with a One-Juniper mindset, one go-to-market organization, one R&D organization and one aligned infrastructure organization. We have focused our go-to-market and R&D resources on projects with highest potential for growth and we continue to drive leverage engineering across our routing, switching and security products, via Junos, Silicon end systems. As part of this realignment, today we announced that sale of our Junos Pulse business which is our SSL VPN solution for securing remote network access. We are making the pivot fully toward stated high growth strategy of Cloud-Builder and High-IQ networks for which security is essential and we are shifting our resources into security areas to commensurate with this strategy.","In terms of how we work. We are implementing initiatives to drive greater collaboration and co-creation across organizational boundaries as well as setting new standards of accountability. These changes will allow us to grow faster, work more efficiently and be more responsive to our customers business imperatives.","Third, we continue to drive structural efficiencies across the organization and have executed on specific cost management actions focused on four key areas, consolidation and reduplication, de-layering the organization, greater automation of business processes and focusing on innovation that matters most to our customers.","Our OpEx this quarter was $515 million, which is $24 million lower than Q4, 2013. Our baseline for the IOP. This represents an annualized savings of approximately $100 million, nearly two-third towards our goal of $160 million in annual savings. The $24 million of in-quarter savings are primarily headcount related costs and structural in nature. Approximately three-quarters of our headcount savings comes from de-layering and reduplicating management positions.","We also reduced approximately 10% of our facility footprint by implementing a new dynamic workplace model. In addition, we have made decisions that will give us line of sight to do remaining cost savings goal by Q1, 2015. Our cost control committee under my leadership continues to drive implementation of efficiencies throughout the organization.","All actions to-date are strengthening Juniper's muscle and smart efficiencies with mechanisms in place to ensure cost will not come back even after we reach our targeted savings goal.","Finally, we've greatly improved our allocation and management of capital. We continue to deliver very strong cash flows from our operations. This has been a consistent area of our strength for Juniper enabling us to invest in growing the business as well as generating returns for our shareholders.","The actions we\u2019re taking include the initiation of the quarterly cash dividend this quarter and then aggressive return of $3 billion to our shareholders as per our plan. In addition, we\u2019ve successfully concluded our patent litigation and recorded a gain of $195 million. We are committed to delivering our integrated operating plans and driving significant value for our shareholders.","Now let me talk about the industry outlook. As the customization of demand for rapid innovation as mass scale, our customers willing to continue to invest in the network. We are seeing our key verticals at the forefront of this wave of change making the transition to high-IQ networking and Cloud-Building and they\u2019re all driving towards a common set of network architectures that are converging across verticals.","Market fundamentals for Juniper\u2019s routing products continues to be healthy and increasingly diversified. Routing demand is being driven by consolidation of networks across business and residential services, wireline and wireless and the need for Cloud-Building. Bandwidth demand continues to increase and favors our products speed and density advantage such as the industry\u2019s first 0.5 Terabyte per second line card in our MX platform that we\u2019ve just begun shipping.","Demand for switching products also remain strong driven by four trends. First next generation data center transformation projects, and the need for carrier grade availability and operational simplicity. Second, hyperscale cloud build outs. Third proliferation of big data and video requiring very high performance networking and 10 Gigabit Ethernet refresh. And fourth, increasing need for open architectures and end-to-end automation.","These trends favor our products. For example, our customers have been using our QFX5100 line as a fundamental building blocks for carrier class layer 2 and 3 switching as well as the foundation for automation capabilities such as seamless workloads movements.","In addition, many of our customers are going into production with Contrail as they look to automate and orchestrate the creation of highly scalable virtual networks. In Q2, we have had two large public clouds go live with Contrail, one in APAC and the other CloudWatt, the largest cloud in France. We've helped launch private cloud as well including one with a global leader in enterprise security.","In security, the decline of our legacy NetScreen product has accelerated and while we disappointed with overall growth rate, we are pleased that our Junos Space SRX portfolio was up 11% in the first half of the year, the growth was driven by demands for high performance Firewalls, virtualized Firewalls, high IQ features for stress detection and mitigation and end to end management simplicity. As I've noted before, SRX based security offerings are a differentiated and critical element of our strategy of Cloud-Building and delivering high IQ networks.","Let me walk you through why. One, our Cloud-Building customers are increasingly aware that integrating carrier class security is an imperative and therefore are choosing our security ramping and switching products as an on-sample for the cloud and virtualized data centers. Two, as our customers make the transition to LTE and NFV, security has become a crucial component of their overall solution. And example is security based services that work seamlessly with our MX and Contrail products. And finally there is a significant level of technology sharing between our Junos-based SRX security routing and switching across silicon systems and software that enables a very high leverage R&D strategy.","We are executing on this strategy focusing our security investments on projects with the highest ROI, while improving the overall profitability of our company. As the only high performance, pure play IP networking company, we are uniquely positioned to build the bridge of the future for our customers. We are playing a critical role in helping them be more relevant as they look to create new business models, increase productivity and optimize for rapid deployment of new services. I see great opportunity across our customer base and I am confident that Juniper can help our customers change the world in creative new ways.","In summary while there are some specific customer dynamics that we are carefully navigating in the near-term I am confident in our opportunities and growth prospects in the medium and long-term. I would like to thank our employees for the commitments and relentless focus on our customers and execution.","Now I will turn it over to Robyn to provide more details on our financial results.","Robyn Denholm","","Thank you Shaygan and good afternoon everyone I am pleased to report that our Q2 \u201814 results reflect healthy revenue growth and continued strong earnings expansion. Revenue increased 7% year-over-year with growth in all three geographies, driven by good performance in our routing, switching and SRX security products. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 38% year-over-year, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit earnings growth.","Before I go into detail on the quarter's results, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our Integrated Operating Plan. One of the important elements of our cost reduction activities is that we have been very mindful of how we allocate and shift resources to ensure that we continue to invest in areas that will drive the future growth of the company.","In the quarter, we consolidated our Sunnyvale campus, discontinued several R&D projects which had a lower return on investment and lastly, completed our headcount restructuring. As a result of these actions in the quarter, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $72 million, approximately $10 million with the headcount actions taken during the first half of the year, the remaining $62 million was related to asset write-downs including $44 million for facility consolidation, $14 million for inventory and $4 million for R&D project cancellations and asset impairments.","This brings total restructuring charges to-date to $194 million versus our original total estimate of $220 million. We are pleased with the pace with which we are taking out structural cost out of the business and anticipate our future restructuring charges to be in the order of $5 million to $10 million.","I'm also pleased with the execution of our capital return plan. As I mentioned during our call last quarter, we initiated a $1.2 billion ASR of which $900 million of shares were delivered in Q1. We expect the remaining shares to be delivered no later than the end of August.","Given our strong cash generation, we intend to opportunistically repurchase a minimum of $550 million in addition to the ASR by the end of the year. This means that before year-end we'll complete at least $1.75 billion against our commitment to repurchase $2 billion by the end of Q1 2015. I am also pleased to announce the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock. This puts in place another piece of our commitment to returning $3 billion to our shareholders over the next three years.","As we have said before, we expect to grow this dividend over time. These capital initiatives reflect our confidence in the underlying long-term strength of Juniper's business as well as our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. We have carefully structured the program to ensure flexibility to support innovation and growth initiatives. And as you would expect, we will provide update on our progress against these initiatives each quarter.","Now, I would like to move into a discussion of the Q2 results. Looking at our demand metrics, our book-to-bill was approximately 1. Total product deferred revenue was up sequentially $20 million and down $26 million year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to an increase in channel related inventory. Total revenue for the quarter was $1,230 million, up 7% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.","Product revenue was up 8% year-over-year and 6% over last quarter. As you may recall, in Q2 of 2013, we recognized $34 million of previously deferred routing revenue from a U.S. government customer. If you exclude the revenue recognition from last year\u2019s results, total revenue growth this quarter would have been 10% and product revenue growth would have been 12%. This revenue recognition also impacted the year-over-year growth grades through enterprise and routing. Services revenue was $300 million, up 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. There were no 10% customers this quarter.","For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.46, an increase of $0.27 year-over-year. This included a net gain of $195 million related to a patent litigation settlement, which resulted in a $0.41 positive impact to earnings. This was offset by restructuring and other charges of $72 million which resulted in a $0.15 negative impact. In the quarter we also incurred a charge of $0.03 associated with an industry wide memory product quality related item.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.40, up $0.11 year-over-year and over last quarter. This represents a 38% increase, both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to a substantial improvement in operating margin fueled by higher revenue, improved gross margins and the decrease in operating expenses. We had a positive impact from reduced share count of approximately $0.02 year-over-year.","Before I go into detail on revenue, I\u2019d like to highlight some of the trends that we saw this quarter. We continue to see healthy drivers of long-term demand and design wins with customers across the world. In the U.S., we saw continued momentum in demand with Web 2.0, cable and enterprise customers. This diversity of demand is a key strength for us going forward.","However life in the quarter, we saw some delays in the timing of project with the few key U.S. service providers. Based on current visibility, we expect these delays to impact second half results. Outside of the Americas, we saw continued strength in EMEA carrier spending coupled with several good build in select markets in APAC.","Now let's look at the results in detail. All written experience sequential revenue growth Americas revenue was up 5% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Americas service provider was up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially driven primarily by Web 2.0 customers, a reflection of the continued diversity of our revenue.","Americas enterprise decreased 9% year-over-year. However taking into account the previously mentioned government deferred revenue recognition from last year the growth rate would have been 6%. Sequentially Americas enterprise increased 6% led by strength in the U.S. federal market. EMEA revenue was up 8% over last year and 10% sequentially due to healthy growth in the service provider market with particular strength among large carriers in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East.","APAC was flat sequentially, an increase $0.11 year-over-year primarily driven by strength with regional carriers across the theatre as well as growth in the enterprise market. Service provider revenue for the quarter was $832 million, up 15% year-over-year across all three geographies and up 6% sequentially driven by EMEA and the Americas. Enterprise revenue was $398 million down 6% year-over-year excluding the government deferred revenue recognition from last year so year-over-year growth rate was 2%.","Sequentially enterprise revenue was up 3% led by healthy U.S. federal and financial services demand partially offset by routing products revenue with $618 million up 12% sequentially and 7% year-over-year; the sequential growth was driven by a strong performance for MX and significant improvement for (inaudible). Switching products revenue was a record $200 million up 25% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The sequential growth rate was driven primarily by QFabric products. The year-over-year growth was driven by a combination of both QFX and EX products.","Total security product revenue was $112 million down 17% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. We are disappointed with this performance however it does reflect the trend that we have been seeing as steady increase in Junos-based security products and a significant drop in the non-Junos-based security products.","Our SRX platform and security software were up 9% year-over-year and up 11% for the first half of the year. We have included a table in our slide deck breaking out the security product revenue.","Moving on to the gross margin and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 64.2% compared to 63.5% last quarter and 63.7% a year ago. The sequential improvement was driven by an increase in both product and services gross margin. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 65.4%, up six-tenth of a point from last quarter and up 1.6 points from a year-ago. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by increased volume.","Non-GAAP services gross margins were 60.5%, down 2.8 points from a year ago and up eight-tenth of a point sequentially. The year-over-year decline is higher support cost. The sequential increase is due to higher revenue and flat support related cost. We expect services margins to continue to modestly improve in the second half of the year.","We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $515 million at the lower end of the range that we gave last quarter, reflecting our focus in execution against our integrated operating plan. This represents the $27 million or 5% sequential reduction. This includes a $6 million reduction in patent litigation related expenses versus the first quarter, due to the settlement. The remaining legal and litigation fees in Q2 were $12 million, consistent with Q1. We are on track to deliver against the $160 million of annualized cost reduction goal that we announced in February.","Our headcount ended the quarter at 9,083 which represents 5% decline sequentially and year-over-year.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 22.3% reflecting a year-over-year expansion of 3.4 points and a sequential increase of 5.1 points due to higher revenue, improved gross margins and lower operating expenses.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 26% compared to 25.6% last quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 24.9% compared to 25.3% in Q1. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of net cash and investments, an increase of approximately $480 million sequentially. This includes a $165 million related to the patent litigation settlement.","Onshore cash and investments represented approximately 37% of total growth cash balance. Q2 operating cash flows were unusually strong at $425 million. This included $75 million of cash received from the patent litigation settlement. The strong cash flows during the quarter were also attributable to higher net income, lower incentive compensation payments and improved working capital metrics. Inline with recent trends, DSO improved to 41 days. CapEx was $41 million in the quarter and depreciation and amortization expense was $45 million.","Now I will review our outlook for Q3. As a reminder these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share account. As previously mentioned, there were some customer specific dynamics in the near term that we have factored in, into our outlook. While we are well positioned with these customers, with our current visibility to we expect sequencing and timing related delays to effect both Q3 and Q4. This is partially offset by science and strength in emerging verticals such as Web 2.0 and cable as well as a positive outlook for enterprise. We see positive momentum in EMEA with customers continuing to build out their network capacity.","For the third quarter we expect revenues to range from $1,150 million to $1,200 million. Gross margins are expected to be 64%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be $505 million, plus or minus $5 million, which at the midpoint is a $10 million reduction from Q2, and a $5 million reduction from our previously published targets. We\u2019re delivering on our cost reduction commitments.","Operating margins are expected to be 21%, plus or minus 0.5%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.35 and $0.40 per share, assuming a share count of approximately $475 million. This continues our strong expansion of earnings with growth of 14% at the midpoint of the guided range. We expect a flat tax rate versus the second quarter.","As you know, we announced the sell of our Junos Pulse business today. The impact has been factored into this guidance and it\u2019s immaterial to our revenue outlook for Q3. The revenue impact beyond Q3 can be guided from the supplemental table provided. We expect this sale to close late in Q3. We have factored the cost-savings associated with this sale as part of our goal of achieving a $160 million in cost savings as we exit the first quarter of 2015.","To conclude, I am really pleased with the performance of the entire Juniper team. The first half of 2014 has been a time of solid execution for the company, we have lots of moving parts and we have continued our focus on the things that matter most to our customers and shareholders. I am very proud of our team and thanks them for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper.","Now, let's open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, first just housekeeping item and then my question. Can you provide us the numbers for Pulse and also the all platform also for Q3 and Q4 of last year, then we'll have a complete picture of how security was trending? Second question and then that goes back to my main question. When I look at your, and this is more kind of a statement than the question I would like to here maybe Shaygan might, I'd like to here your view. When I look at your plan, the expense side of the equation is almost done, you almost finished with the expense reduction. And then I look at the numbers in switching is relatively flat for three quarters now, the growth is mainly because you have easy comps from last year. In security, we are back to the levels, we are down back to the levels of March 13 you quoted the six months numbers, but if you actually look at Q2 numbers were down sequentially back to the levels of first quarter '13 and in routing there are delays. So how long do you think if put the expenses aside, how long do you think is going to take us to see the changes you are implementing on the product portfolio and growth acceleration and impact on switching and routing and security et cetera? Thanks.","Shaygan Kheradpir","","Hi Tal, this is Shaygan, good afternoon. On your first question on drilling into Pulse, I am going to ask Robyn to sort of go through the numbers and then we\u2019ll take the second one.","Robyn Denholm","","Yeah so in the slide deck, that\u2019s on our website we have provided the data for the last six quarters, so you can see the Junos Pulse revenues for the quarter Q2 of \u201814 we did product revenue of 15.9 million which is included in our security product revenue and we also did about $15.5 million worth of services. And as I mentioned the transaction on the Pulse file I will conclude right in third quarter is what we are expecting and so we don\u2019t expect any impact to the revenue in Q3, but you can use the table to model the impact to Q4.","Just going back to the other housekeeping question the ScreenOS product revenue for Q2 \u201814 was about $13.2 million which is less than 12% of our total product revenue that compares to previous quarter where it was under 14% at about 18.3%. So it\u2019s dropping off quite significantly from the ScreenOS perspective.","Shaygan Kheradpir","","Thanks Robyn and Tal on your second question, I would say that we continue to take share on both switching and routing. And as you mentioned before on security this year the stabilization phase, if you look at our numbers this quarter if you normalize for the one time from last year at this time on routing, routing was up 14%, switching was up 24%. We are taking share and we continue to do significant enhancements at both product lines.","For the balance of the year, we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have a couple of U.S. service providers with whom we are very close at all levels and in continuous dialog. Because of their market environment and what they need to do, they are risk sequencing and that's going to impact some of the timing of our programs as we were working with them.","We are -- the growth drivers, our product positioning, we are very encouraged by both and overall for our 2015, we have an overall constructive view of where we are heading. So overall, we feel good about our product positioning and our market positioning. And I think this quarter's growth and growth year-to-date for both routing, switching and I would also say even though in security we are tuning in now heavily to our SRX space, Junos space products, it has respectable growth of 9% year-over-year. So, we feel good. Thank you very much.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Ashwin Kesireddy - JP Morgan","Yes, hi. This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod, thanks for taking my question. I want to understand a little bit about the customer specific dynamics you talk about. You said it's going to be weak in Q3 and Q4. So are we sort of expecting a better seasonal Q1 and Q2 next year? Also if you could comment on which verticals you see impacting, that would be helpful.","Shaygan Kheradpir","","Yes, your first question was about -- Ash was about the dynamics, the market dynamics of the couple of the service providers. I don\u2019t want to really go into that but I think you can see they\u2019re very transparent in terms of where they are putting their capital, for what reason and there is some M&A that is in the market, we know that and I encourage you to think about M&A in the broader sense. And when you put it all together and I have lived in those markets in the U.S. specifically for a quarter century, it makes everything comes together and some of our internal metrics also late in the quarter sort of flash.","So we want to be prudent and we want to be cautious for the balance of the year. But we're also because of the growth drivers that we talked about and where we are from a product perspective, we are overall constructive for 2015. Robyn, do you want to add anything there?","Robyn Denholm","I think you've discussed it quite well, Shaygan.","Shaygan Kheradpir","","Thanks Ash.","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Hi, thank you. Can you clarify if Pulse was contributing positively to EPS for new account for the associated expenses? And then just remind us how much of your revenues go in to campus or access environments as opposed to the focus areas, Shaygan that you\u2019ve talked about of datacenter and cloud.","Shaygan Kheradpir","","Hi Simona, this is Shaygan. I will pass the question to Robyn. I will just say about Pulse, two second. Pulse is a good asset. The issue is it's not in line with our strategy which is very much focused on cloud build or High-IQ and how those markets are shaping. And we want to really focus our security line around growth where the markets are going and very strong in. So with that I am going to pass to Robyn to take the question on Pulse.","Robyn Denholm","Yes. As Shaygan mentioned, intent of doing strategic review with our portfolio, Pulse was an asset, a good asset but as Shaygan mentioned, not directly in the line with strategic focus of the company. And therefore we have announced the sale of the asset today. It has been mildly accretive for us over the years in terms of the overall P&L but given the focus of the company and the intent to return on investment, we\u2019ve decided that that\u2019s an asset that with better in the hands of the another entity to look after it.","Shaygan Kheradpir","And Simona, on your second question I am going to ask Rami to comment and say few words.","Rami Rahim","Yes. On the question on campus versus -- sorry Simona, on the question about the campus versus data center aspects of our switching business. The majority of our switching business goes into data center and combination data center campus switching scenarios. There are in fact large enterprise customers where the line between their mission critical campus and the data center is essentially blurring. They view the campus as an onramp to the data center. We\u2019re not going after the smaller wiring clauses types of campuses; we\u2019re really going after the larger strategic high performance High-IQ type of campus networks that many of our customers are building.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thanks Simona.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Hey guys, hey Robyn, hey Shaygan. How are you?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Hi Ehud.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Hi. A couple of quick questions. First of all, back to the SRX, it was strong in Q3, Q4, was very strong in Q1 and then fell fairly hard to about $80 million in Q2. I want to get a sense if that\u2019s seasonal or because Q2 last year also had a similar impact or was there large build that one on for those three quarters Q3, 4 and 1 or any other color that we can get on the dynamics over there. Then, I wanted to pick up a little bit on Contrail. You talked about continued traction in Contrail. Can you give us a sense as to is that -- is Contrail actually selling the standalone product yet, is there some revenue we can be looking at that or is there pull through that we can be looking on possibly the QFX or other products? And now that Cisco is out with their ACI and their APIC, how are you seeing that change of dynamic in the conversations on Contrail?","And then lastly, Web 2.0 and cable guys, Robyn you talk about these guys a lot now. Can you give us a sense how large to Web 2.0 guys are? Are they 5% of your revenue now? Give us a sense as to what we should be looking from that vertical? Thank you.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thanks Ehud. There is I think four or five questions there, so I'll punch them some quickly and I\u2019ll have Robyn and Rami also chime in if they want. So on SRX, as we have pivoted to Junos Space SRX security line, obviously this is a cloud builder High-IQ service provider carrier grave kind of firewalls. And the sales of that obviously is more lumpy than I would say your grandfather\u2019s firewall in normal branches and stuff. So you will obviously see lumpiness in those sales just because of the nature of what we are selling which is very, very high end. On Contrail we are very happy and encouraged with the progress is that we are very early in the game obviously and it\u2019s all about design wins holistically for clouds be it private clouds or public clouds infrastructure as a service and so forth and so on. So they started this just last year, late last year they have a large number of talks proof of concepts, they have pivoted now from talks making those go into production and the funnel keeps growing on talks. And they are being very deliberate on these wins because they are big they are sophisticated and we have to get them right and we are doing that.","The other two questions were Robyn and Rami.","Robyn Denholm","","So I can answer the question. One thing I wanted to underscore on the SRX Ehud, so you are right it is lumpy and Q1 we did have a deployment in the service provider area and so that is one of the reasons why we saw the sequential decline in SRX based products. In terms of Web 2.0 and cable they did drive the growth in the Americas both sequentially and to some extent year-over-year and as Shaygan mentioned three out of our top five customers as a company are in that Web 2.0 cable sector in the quarter. So they are obviously an important part from a future perspective around the diversification of our revenue.","Having said that, obviously our carriers are also very important to us and as we highlighted in the outlook given their size and relevance to our revenue any reduction in their revenue in the near term does have a direct impact on us.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thank you Robyn. And Ehud on your last question, I would say, suffices to say we are intense of course with our customers all the time and clearly the customers that we work with Cloud Builder, High-IQ types, they are very much want open no lock in and future proof solutions under cloud solutions. So, that's all I say Rami do you want to say anything else on that from that front?","Rami Rahim","I'll just add on the SRX front, there is a service provider component to the business that tends to be somewhat lumpy, the biggest use case being for example LTE security. And then on the Contrail side, I think Shaygan already mentioned it. The one thing that I will add is that we are seeing that in the first few deployments they are being deployed, Contrail being deployed in heterogeneous networks where there is a combination of Juniper and other peer type of infrastructure and it just speaks to the openness of the solution which our customers very much appreciate.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","[And no lock in].","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks Ehud.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks Ehud. Next question please operator?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to understand to what degree the delays are likely to be the most impact of routing business in the second half or if you are expecting to see impact in switching and security given many of your carriers who have buying portfolio products. And then I was also hoping you could help us understand if you expect revenue for the second half of the year to be up relative to the first half of the year and is there any reason we shouldn't expect the overall you to grow in 2014?","Shaygan Kheradpir","","Hi, Jess. So on your first question since they are -- the softness is coming from a couple of U.S. service providers and you are right they buy upon sample, but they are very -- we are very heavily embedded with them with our routing products of MX and TTX series. So the impact is going to be more on our routing rather than switching and security.","And the second question I forgot but I think you will have a Robyn?","Robyn Denholm","Yes. So overall as we said in terms of the outlook we are expecting a down quarter for the third quarter and we are expecting these delays to impact our fourth quarter as well. We do expect on the switching side Shaygan mentioned the routing side, we do expect in switching that in the second half of the year that we will grow that business as well the products in switching area.","Just bear in mind the compares that we have as is that look at the second half for us to switching. And on security we expect the same trend that we've seen over the first half that the ScreenOS product will continue to decline and the Junos based SRX platforms will increase over the second half.","Kathleen Nemeth","","Jess this is Kathleen just to answer your question specifically we do expect overall 2014 revenue to be up this year.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo","Thanks guys.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. This is Trevor (inaudible) in for Ben. My questions on security specifically and around the strategy so what gives you the confidence in the strategy in general and the ability to return to growth across the portfolio? While SRX seems to be core to the strategy it\u2019s on a negative trajectory at the same time as 1Q \u201813 and while the other two businesses are growing pretty nicely despite this. So, at what point does it make sense to consider alternatives given that returns to growth seemingly would require significant investment?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Hi Trevor this is Shaygan. We are very committed to security. Point number one, I went through in my prepared remarks of the logic behind that behind our SRX based security which we think is very differentiated and it\u2019s a very critical element of cloud builder and high IQ networks. I don\u2019t want to repeat what I said in my script but you can go it, I think we\u2019ve laid it out very nicely, quickly know what is going to buy cloud with the big giant hole on the side. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s critical for there. It\u2019s critical for our service provider customers which are even with our increasing diversity of our revenues as you can see, they\u2019re still very material customers. And in their transition to LTE and NFV it is an absolute critical component for their transitions and it works seamlessly with MX and Contrail as hand in glove. And finally if you come into our labs and see the amount of commonality in terms of componentry Silicon, Chassis, of course Junos software they are all, I would, I think leverage engineering is now doesn't quite do justice too, it's a lot of commonality.","And now that all three switching, routing and security are under our JDI organization that's led by Rami, we expect growth to pick-up over to medium and long-term on our security, the logic is very sound and impeccable and pick-up profitably because of the natural synergies that exists between these product lines. ","So yeah, we are very committed to SRX based security products and actually very encouraged to the medium to long-term prospects for the rationale that I went through. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Marketing. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Sue - RBC Marketing","Shaygan, will you recognize the company will keep the assets routing, switching and security\/SRX. Are there other non-essential assets that you can further divest or we [missed you] done with that. And as we look at improving the strength of the SRX and perhaps the other product portfolio segments. Should we think about, how should we think about R&D spending, how should we think about spending potentially going backup or in the process of reducing OpEx but I will be at a point where you need to defend your market share and also improve the products so that the OpEx needs to kind of increase again. How should we think about from a planning point of view what the steady rate OpEx should be on an annual basis?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Yes. Mark again very quickly. As you have managed the business very closely and very prudently, and very focused we continue as a matter of course continue to always look at our portfolio to make sure that they are aligned with our strategy point number one, which is the one you have stated which is IOP which is cloud that there are High-IQ which is around growth and profitable growth that matters to our customers we continue to do that.","As a matter of course we talked about Pulse this was one of them that didn\u2019t fit our (inaudible) charts and we took action. So that\u2019s just been normal course of our business and now that we have a very clear strategy that we have tested over and over again, internally, externally I just came back with 70 partners and customers, it\u2019s just a very vivid that this is where the world is going and what we are doing is exactly right.","So we have the right filter to balance that upon. The second question is it\u2019s about we are also very committed to our IOP targets and I reemphasized that so you should rest assured there. And I think our track record so far should give you some comfort that we know how to land the IOP targets. And the last question was\u2026","Robyn Denholm","","Yes sure, just on the planning purposes on the OpEx side in the slide deck we included our charts, obviously we are committed to the 160 in terms of cost reductions exiting Q1 of 2015 as Shaygan mentioned. We have also said that will be less than $500 million for Q1 of 2015 we have just achieved the low end of their range for Q2 in terms of 515 and we have given you guidance for 505 plus or minus 5 for both Q3 and Q4. So, as Shaygan mentioned, we are very committed to the OpEx target and we are doing it in a way that makes it clear that we continue to invest in our long-term future around product development. And yes\u2026. ","Shaygan Kheradpir","And thank you Robyn. And Mark, the last point is IOP is all about focusing on where the market is going and profitable growth. So all the actions we are taking is actually putting our best engineers, our best go-to-market people very focused around areas of growth and strengthening those.","So, as we\u2019ve said before this is not a slash and burn kind of a project. It's very surgical, very focused, we are -- the thing we just did with Pulse and some of the best engineers and so forth and so on. We all focusing them on the growth of security and SRX based products as opposed to in a wide spectrum of things which we may have net prospects for growth.","So, we feel very good about our strategy and feel very good about our focus on the product line, our level of talent where the products are going, very excited about the pipeline and very extremely happy with the level of customer engagements, the way I described in my prepared remarks in terms of going deep with them on the strategic customers and strategic partners. This is what IOP is all about. And the good news is when you focus, you also eliminate unnecessary cost. This is what we're doing and we're committed to all of the above. Thank you.","Mark Sue - RBC Marketing","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi. Please proceed with your question.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","","Hi guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Shaygan, Robyn I was wondering is there a way to quantify what do you think the impact is from the delays with the U.S. based service providers? If I look at the midpoint of your guidance, you are about 85 million short of where consensus was. And I am just trying to get a sense is the majority of that explained by these delays? And then just a quick follow up on Junos Pulse, Robyn why wouldn't we see incremental OpEx savings in the fourth quarter once the divestiture has occurred?","Shaygan Kheradpir","","Hi Amitabh, this is Shaygan. I think the answer to your first question, quick answer is yes it is those couple of U.S. based service providers for very specific market reasons in their markets and dynamics that have impacted their second half. I will now hand it to Robyn to take the rest.","Robyn Denholm","Yes, in terms of the OpEx related to Pulse that is included in $160 million of OpEx savings. We had identified this as an area for which we believe that we could save some OpEx and focus the company in terms of the overall strategy that we were focused on.","Kathleen Nemeth","","Okay. All right, thanks Amitabh. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today. That is all the time that we have. We appreciate your excellent questions and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you. Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. Kevin is joining us from Davos, where he is participating in the World Economic Forum. Before we continue, I would like to highlight the reporting change that we are preparing to implement. As we discussed early last year, we are aligning our resources with our platforms and software strategy. In 2012 we will conform our financial reporting to these business segments. Under the new segment structure, we expect certain product families to be reported under new segments. We will provide you 2 years of recast quarterly history, and we'll continue to provide key product category data. ","Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call.","In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, we'll also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.","On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin R. Johnson","Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Our results for Q4 are in line with the updated outlook we provided earlier this month, and Robyn will cover the details after my remarks. I'd like to spend a few minutes providing some insights on our 2011 performance, the near-term macro environment and industry dynamics, as well as our strategic approach, which is centered on innovation and customer value. I'll wrap up by sharing our operating principles for 2012, and update you on our innovation pipeline. ","Juniper's revenue growth was 9% for 2011. Annual revenue for 2011 represented a new record for the company. Profitability was solid, though lower than expected. Our Q4 results felt the effect of increased macro volatility that escalated over the second half of the year due to the sovereign debt concerns in Europe and slowing recoveries in APAC countries as well as the U.S. ","Here on our U.S. business, we saw a number of our largest customers reduce their spend within the quarter, including Tier 1 service providers and financial services. Though on other sectors like Federal, we saw stronger spending than expected. Another factor that played into recent results is the fact that we're entering what is surely the most exciting new product cycle in our history. As we move through the launch phase on these products, we've seen some short-term effects, particularly in core routing as customers awaited the T4000. This product is now shipping, and we are seeing very good early response. Our PTX transport core product line is also on track to release later this quarter. ","There are also some significant positives in our results, particularly in Enterprise. Even with the macro headwinds and product transitions I described, Enterprise sales were up 9% year-on-year for Q4 and 11% for the full year. This growth reflects good performance in both routing and switching, with the latter category up 28% in 2011. We are taking share in the Enterprise consistent with our stated objectives. Enterprise growth is one of several proof points that validate our strategy and reinforce the strength of our value proposition to customers. We are firmly grounded in our strategic direction, and we will continue to play offense, while managing through the current pressures in our industry. As we begin a very active 2012 here at Juniper, I think it's a good time to refresh on the 5 key components of our strategy. ","One, we are pure play in high-performance networking. All of our world-class talent is focused 100% on expanding our leadership in this category, which we firmly believe will encompass most of the networking market as the 2 megatrends of mobility and Cloud computing accelerate. ","Two, we are recognized around the world as the innovation leader in networking. We are committed to investing in R&D at a level that drives our innovation agenda, enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers. ","Three, we are committed to leveraging our R&D investment to develop products and solutions that span both our Service Provider customer base and our growing Enterprise customer base. Again, the trends of mobility and Cloud computing make it easier for us to harness the strategy across the 2 sectors. ","Four, we are diversifying our customer base. We have significantly broadened our Service Provider business over the last several years, adding 155 net new Service Provider customers in 2011. We're also expanding our presence in the Enterprise, and we continue to take share. ","And five, we are complementing our system strategy with the Junos Space software solutions. These solutions leverage the one Junos platform and are highly synergistic toward systems business. We believe this strategy aligns very well with the powerful forces that are driving the new network. Innovation is what will drive long-term value creation in the networking industry, as customers abandon the complexity and unnecessary costs that plague old architectures and embrace open systems that can scale across multiple dimensions of network growth. As our innovation takes hold in the market, we are seeing competition become more aggressive. This only reinforces that we are on the right track, and we need to maintain our investments and continue to innovate faster than the competition. We will stay the course with our organic R&D investment. 2012 is a major new product year for Juniper. We will be very focused on making investments that best monetize our innovations, while remaining thoughtful about spending levels across the business. It is important to recognize that Juniper's R&D commitment has rewarded the company time and time again. Five years ago we began investing in the MX 3D Edge routing platform. We maintained our investment, and MX has established Juniper as a key player to Service Provider Edge. ","Our EX switching portfolio is another example. Over a 3- to 5-year arc, the EX has further expanded our portfolio and has translated, as we predicted, into a share-taking position for Juniper in switching. We fully expect our new line of next generation data center fabric will enable us to take that position to a new level. Of course, there are some implications as we release new innovation into the market. For example, we've just started shipping the T4000 as planned, and this may have slowed T Series orders over the last 6 months as customers awaited the new product. These customers know that we are updating the performance that we deliver in the core. ","In Security, our customers are continuing to adopt Junos Space SRX offerings. While our SRX portfolio for service providers is strong, there are some product features that we are focusing on for our Enterprise customers. You'll hear more about our action plan for Security and other innovation development in a special technology discussion with Stefan Dyckerhoff and Bob Muglia at Mobile World Congress at the end of February. ","So we are confident in our strategy, our innovation pipeline and the deeper penetration we are achieving in both Service Provider and the Enterprise, but the near-term environment remains challenging. As we have done in the past few years, we have established a set of operating principles by which we are managing through the year. For 2012, those principles are: first, we are assuming continued uncertainty in the near-term macro environment; second, we plan to grow faster than the markets we serve, focusing on new product introductions to accelerate growth as we exit the year; third, we will maintain investments that deliver innovation in our product roadmap; fourth, we are focused on prudent cost management; and fifth, we expect to generate solid cash flows to support our strategic needs, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. As we operate the business within these principles, we are maximizing the success and accelerating the adoption of our new innovations coming to market. ","I'm pleased with the progress we are making and the customer feedback we are hearing. I'd like to share a few examples. Our T4000 router is now shipping, and 2 major Service Provider customers, Telefonica and Comcast, placed initial orders in Q4. Our PTX trial process is going well, and we received customer orders for this product, which will ship as planned later this quarter. QFabric had its first full quarter of revenue contribution, which exceeded our expectations. Most important at this stage, however, is securing early adopters for deploying QFabric and will serve as references to other interested customers. This creates and accelerates the demand cycle. We are pleased with the progress in this area as we now have a number of key customers in various stages of deployment across all 3 theaters. These wins, combined with the growing pipeline of opportunity, is also generating more and more partner attention on this important product. ","In the quarter, we released the next wave of Mobile Next features, including the S-gateway, as planned. Customers trial and third-party tests are showing that MobileNext evolved packet core software running on an MX 3D delivers breakthrough performance results for customers. And that success is supported by an increased interest we are seeing with Service Providers. As an example is Elisa Corporation, the Finnish telecoms and ICT services company, which has selected the Juniper Networks MobileNext portfolio as a unique mobile packet core solution in its network. ","To wrap up, we are aligned strategically to address what we firmly believe is a vibrant long-term growth opportunity in networking. There are some near-term challenges, but as we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to investing in an innovation roadmap that best positions us to capture the long-term opportunity ahead. The 2 key trends of mobility and Cloud are fully intact and, in fact, are accelerating demand for the differentiated products we offer. Customers increasingly recognize that legacy networks are plagued by complexity, unnecessary cost and inadequate performance. And customers around the world are embracing flatter networks that reduce complexity and cost, while delivering dramatic improvements in performance and scale. We are the one of the very few companies delivering breakthrough technology in the networking category, and we fully embrace that position. We look forward to seeing you at our upcoming meeting at Mobile World Congress. In the meantime, thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it over now to Robyn to cover the results.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. The December quarter was an atypical and unexpectedly weak finish to the 2011 fiscal year. These results are consistent with the revised ranges we provided on January 9. With the backdrop of continuing uncertainty in the macro environment, 2 main factors contributed to the weakness. Firstly, our largest Service Provider customers reduced their spending intentions within the quarter. And secondly, while our Enterprise business did well, the growth was driven primarily by Federal, with a softer finish than expected in other areas. ","Looking at our demand metrics, book-to-bill was 1.0 and product deferred revenue was up slightly sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year. While we believe that the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact and the near-term outlook remains uncertain, in this environment a careful approach is appropriate as we anticipate the effect on customer demand and the prioritization of their investment and project deployment. We will continue to execute our strategy, whilst remaining focused on prudent expense management. ","Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,121,000,000, up 1% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. Revenue for the full year was $4,449,000,000, up 9% year-over-year. There were no customers who accounted for more than 10% of total revenue in the quarter or for the full year. For the fourth quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.18. Included in the GAAP diluted earnings was a $0.02 impact for restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.28, which is unchanged sequentially, and a $0.14 year-over-year decrease. As a reminder, last year's non-GAAP diluted earnings included a $0.03 favorable impact related to the renewal of the full year R&D tax credit in the quarter. ","For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.79 compared to $1.15 from the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.19 versus $1.32 a year ago. Now let me provide you some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. ","In the fourth quarter, the Americas were approximately 46% of total revenue, EMEA was 36% and APAC was 18%. Americas revenue was down 6% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, primarily due to the reduction in demand by some of our largest Service Providers. This year-over-year decline was partially offset by good Enterprise growth. EMEA revenue was up 28% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, with both Service Provider and Enterprise gains. We saw good growth in Eastern Europe and The Netherlands. In addition, we saw the first revenue from a significant new win with a top Service Provider in Eastern Europe, which spans a broad range of our product portfolio. APAC revenue decreased 16% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. This was primarily due to continued weakness in Japan and the push out of some demand in China. ","Now looking at the revenue by segment. Infrastructure revenue was $849 million, up 2% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. Within this segment, total router product revenue was $507 million, down 8% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Total MX product revenue was $255 million, up 11% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. This reflects the healthy competitive position and incremental wins we've secured in the Edge. T Series products were down sequentially as a result of weaker overall demand from Service Providers, coupled with unexpected pause as we introduced the T4000. As planned, we shipped the first T4000 units this quarter and expect first revenue in Q1. We also anticipate the first PTX shipments in Q1, and both products are generating excellent customer interest. ","Total switching revenue was a record $168 million, up 28% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Product revenue, which includes QFabric and wireless LAN, was $157 million, up 29% sequentially and 33% year-over-year. This was driven by a strength in our EX product, both in data center and campus deployment. We also recorded the initial revenues from the first deployment of our full QFabric solution. We are very encouraged by the strong customer interest in this disruptive technology. ","For the full year, Infrastructure revenue was $3.4 billion, up 12% from the prior year. This was comprised primarily of router product revenue of $2.3 billion, up 7%; and switching product revenue of $493 million, up 31%. ","Moving on to the SLT segment. Revenue for the quarter was $272 million, which was flat sequentially and down 4% year-on-year. For the full year, SLT revenue was just over $1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. SRX product revenue for the quarter was $81 million, down 12% from a strong third quarter. As we have noted in the past, SRX revenues will vary by quarter, influenced by the timing of high-end SRX Service Provider deployment. ","In the Enterprise, we have seen positive customer traction with the branch SRX, but the revenue growth from these products has not offset the decline of the older Enterprise security products. The Q4 release of the security design application in Junos Space, and the product roadmap are promising steps as we stabilize and ultimately regain growth in the Enterprise segment of the security market. We continue to see good adoption of Junos Pulse and had our first revenue from the new mobile security suite. Also, we began our first customer deployment of MobileNext and had new video optimization design wins, both of which will yield revenue this year. ","Looking more closely at the markets we address. Service Provider revenue was $677 million, down 1% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Lower routing revenue was partially offset by strength in switching, both sequentially and year-over-year. We also saw strength in sales to cable providers and T2 carriers. Enterprise revenue was $444 million, up 6% sequentially, due primarily to strength in switching. We also saw strength in sales to Federal and several European countries. ","Revenue was up 9% year-over-year as routing and switching growth offset a slight decline in security. For the quarter, Service Provider was 60% of total revenue and Enterprise was 40% of total revenue. For the full year, Service Provider was 64% of total revenue and Enterprise was 36% of total revenue. Our increasingly diversified revenue base, both in Service Provider and in Enterprise, helped offset some of the weakness with our top customers. ","Now moving on to our margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP margins for the fourth quarter were 63.3% compared to 65.3% last quarter. Product gross margins were 64.2% of product revenue, down 3.3% sequentially and 5.1 points year-over-year. Gross margins for the quarter were negatively impacted by 3 mix-related factors: firstly, a lower proportion of router sales; secondly, a shift in the geographic mix of revenue from the Americas to EMEA; and lastly, a higher percentage of services in our total revenue. Performance for the year was impacted by these same factors, as well as increased fixed overhead and inventory-related costs. Whilst we recognize competitors are positioning themselves aggressively, we've not seen any discernible difference in our discounting or in our win-loss ratio. ","Our strategy is to continue to differentiate our products through innovation and total cost of ownership. Services gross margin were 60.6%, up 3.2 points from the prior quarter and 2 points compared to the prior year. This was a result of higher overall services revenue and good cost management. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat sequentially at $501 million, driven by lower variable compensation, offset by higher prototype and development costs, and very good cost management. ","R&D expenses were down 1% from both the prior quarter and last year's fourth quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. G&A expenses remained about 3% of sales at $38 million. ","Looking at headcount. We ended the year at 9,129 employees, a slight sequential decrease and a net increase of 357 heads or 4% from last year. We have slowed our hiring and are focused on the most strategic requirements as we address the near-term environment. Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter was 18.6%, down 1.4 points sequentially and down 5.9 points year-over-year. ","Looking at operating margins by segment. Infrastructure operating margin decreased 1.5 points sequentially and 9 points lower year-over-year. This was primarily due to lower revenue and product gross margins. For the full year, Infrastructure operating margin was 21% of sales, 4.4 points lower than last year. As a reminder, the results of the infrastructure segment include routers, switchers, MobileNext and QFabric. ","SLT operating margin was 23.4%, 1.1 points lower sequentially and 3.7 points above last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, SLT operating margin was 19.4% of sales, 0.5 point lower than last year. ","The GAAP tax rate was 21.5% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 23.7%, down 3.7 points from the prior quarter. This was due to our geographic mix of earnings and a onetime impact from the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters. ","Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the year with $4.3 billion of total cash and investment with approximately 50% on shore. Our net cash and investment was $3.3 billion. DSO was 46 days in the quarter, up from 36 days last quarter, but in line with Q4 last year. Cash from operations was a strong $244 million this quarter, up $58 million sequentially and down $127 million from the prior year. ","For the full year, we generated strong cash flows at $987 million from operations. Q4 CapEx totaled $78 million. For the full year, CapEx was $266 million, an increase of $81 million over the prior year. This was driven primarily by the cost for our Sunnyvale camp -- corporate campus. ","Depreciation and amortization was flat with last quarter at approximately $43 million. Our weighted average shares on a diluted basis for the quarter were 533 million shares, a decrease of approximately 3 million from the third quarter. On a full year basis, we bought back $541 million of shares, which largely offset stock issued through our employee equity program. ","Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we believe the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact, and we are confident about the growth potential of our new product portfolio. However, we are concerned by the near-term uncertainty in the macro environment and the effect it may have on the level, timing and prioritization of customer demand. Given this view, we expect Q1 2012 to be challenging. We are expecting revenues to range between $960 million and $990 million. This reflects seasonally lower Enterprise spending and continued caution by Service Providers. Gross margins for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of 63% to 64%. We expect the first quarter's revenue mix to have similar characteristics to last quarter's, but should see progress from our continued focus on cost improvement. Operating expenses are expected to increase in Q1 as we incorporate the typical increases in employee expenses such as FICA and the reset of variable compensation. ","As we have done before, we will continue to make the strategic R&D and go-to-market investments that are necessary to successfully execute our strategies and capitalize on the new product cycles, while carefully managing costs. And as a result of lower revenue, similar gross margins and higher operating expenses for the first quarter, we expect operating margins for the first quarter to range from 11% to 13%. This is expected to result in first quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.11 and $0.14 per share. This assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%. The tax rate includes an estimated $0.01 quarterly impact on EPS, and assumes no renewal of the R&D tax credit. ","In summary, we are confident of our strategy of disruptive innovation, and our operating principles for the year position us very well going forward. In the near term, we anticipate the revenue environment will remain challenging. For the full year, we expect to grow faster than the markets we serve based on the new product cycles and the conversion of current design wins. We also anticipate that we will improve our operating margin from the Q1 level throughout the year. We will navigate this near-term uncertain demand environment as we have in the past, remaining focused on prudent expense management, investing in critical areas of the business to drive growth and continuing to bring value to our customers as they address the market demands of mobile Internet and Cloud computing. I want to thank our employees for their continued support. Their dedication, innovation and commitment to delivering the new network are keys to our success. With that, I will hand it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Marshall with ISI group.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A question with respect to Service Provider CapEx outlook. Obviously very difficult to ascertain, but I was wondering -- and obviously you're not talking about things from a quantitative perspective, but more qualitatively, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, kind of, your best guess with respect to when things might start to pick up from an industry standpoint from a wireline CapEx perspective. Historically, it seems like these things happen, kind of, in 4 quarters, and it seems like that we're kind of halfway through, if that's the case, implying a bottom in the, sort of, summer time frame this year. Would you, kind of, agree with that?","Kevin R. Johnson","I'll go ahead and take that, Robyn. Let me just comment on some of the trends, Brian, that we see unfolding. First, I think clearly, there's a shift of CapEx from wireline to wireless. And when we look at that shift, fundamentally, that plays into the architectural approach that we put together. Architecturally, when we look at that shift from wireline to wireless, we believe customers -- certainly, there'll be a wave of investment around radio access networks, but then as things come to the packet-switched network, we believe in Fixed Mobile Convergence, so the unified Edge, which basically is what we architected the MX 3D to do -- was to be able to handle both the wireline and wireless side. And so with that shift from wireline to wireless, we think that starts to play into the architectural value proposition that we have about helping customers collapse multiple networks into a single unified Edge, which gives them better economics in terms of carrying that traffic. ","In addition to that shift, there's also the trend that I think you see with Service Providers where they're much more closely looking at the level of CapEx relative to revenue generation. And this is something, too, that over the last 3 years we've predicted as customers look at their revenues streams and start to map the level of investment required to drive that revenue, they're looking for efficiencies and efficient use of capital. We believe that, too, plays to our value proposition, whether it's on the Edge with the unified Edge or whether it's in the core or whether it's in the Converged Supercore. And so with that market shift, we think it plays to several things that have been a core part of our strategy over the last few years, as we've built these architectures and products. Now the question is, if you think about going through the year, when and how will CapEx unfold? ","First, I'll just remind you that the packet-switched networking component of CapEx is a small percentage of the total Service Provider CapEx. I do believe that in talking to many customers, certainly a combination of the uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation, and the implication that has on financial services and the implication that has on access to capital is one of the reasons, I think, that Service Providers are being somewhat perhaps more cautious in the levels of capital expenditures, but they're also being more mindful of how those capital expenditures are aligned behind their revenue generation. So I think we're going to have to wait and see how the macroeconomic situation unfolds, and our approach is going to be consistent with what we've done in the past, is to remain very agile as we see that unfold, yet staying true to our strategy. Because we believe we have the right strategy that plays to the value proposition these customers need and are looking for, and we're going to have to just be agile as we work through the time period and see how these things start to pick up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum from Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of things. When you look at -- Robyn, you're talking about the T Series and the T4000 stalling a little bit on the router side. At what point did you see that happen? And since PTX is also somewhat of a core router type of product, are you seeing any mix of customer base? Perhaps -- PTX perhaps cannibalizes some of your T Series or core, or you're seeing anything happening there in the dynamic?   ","Then a clarification in the Enterprise side. If you can you just give us what the wireless LAN revenues did, that will be helpful also. ","And then finally, on the MX, that did very well this quarter. How do you see that? If you can give us a sense as to, kind of, how that plays out through the rest of 2012.  Does it start weak and then go up every quarter throughout or you're, kind of, still waiting to see what carriers do before you kind of call what the MX is going to do?","Robyn M. Denholm","I'll start answering the question, and then Kevin can elaborate as well. So in terms of routing, as Kevin mentioned before, we are very confident in the strategies that we have both on the core and on the Edge in terms of the Universal Edge and the core. In terms of customers pausing for the T4000, we were expecting that in the quarter. If you recall back to last quarter's call, we had a surprisingly strong quarter in T in Q3, and we called that out. We actually were expecting it to decline in the quarter and it did. In terms of the overall commentary about routing, we obviously did see that come down during the quarter as service providers changed their spending intentions within the quarter. With respect to wireless LAN, I talked about the total switching growth in the quarter. We saw growth in all 3 areas of the switching of EX, as well as wireless LAN as well as QFabric quarter-over-quarter. So we are pleased with the progress across the board for the switching portfolio. ","And with respect to MX, the strength in the quarter, we did see that come back up as we called out on the third quarter's earnings call. That's a result of both new design wins and continued deployment of existing design wins that we have on the MX side. And our view is that, that platform is very strong in the Universal Edge. Strategically, as Kevin commented, there is a convergence from the Edge, and we believe that MX is very well positioned for that. Kevin, anything you'd like to add?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, I'll just add on the question you had about the PTX, Ehud. Look most of the PTX deals that we're working on, fundamentally the PTX and Converged Supercore, it collapses multiple layers of the network. It doesn't replace the core. And so most of the deals we're working on have T Series for the core MX and the PTX, as we're working with customers. So I don't anticipate that the PTX is a product line the cannibalizes the core. What it does is it now extends the core and allows that core network to be able to collapse multiple networks into a single point with the PTX.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to ask about margins of core routing and Edge routing. First, do you see any pricing pressure in the market within -- when you look at like-to-like, kind of, customers outside of geographical mix? And then how is pricing different between core and Edge? I'm asking this just because Cisco mentioned repeatedly in the last 6 months about declining margins in routing, and I want to correlate it with your declining margins.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. So I'll answer that question, Tal. So firstly, as we've stated strategically, our -- the way we work with customers is on total cost of ownership in terms of delivering products into the market that would reduce their cost of ownership both in terms of CapEx and OpEx. And so we've been focused on that across all the product areas that we're in, with both Service Provider customers and with Enterprise customers. That is our core way of operating within the marketplace. And we continue to deliver the innovation that customers need in order to do that. ","In terms of our pricing, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're not seeing any discernible difference in our discounting practices or in the win-loss ratios versus any other period of time. So there is obviously -- the competitive environment is intense, but it's always been intense. So our view is that, that hasn't changed. I think what has [Audio Gap] we are delivering innovation to the market that directly drives total cost of ownership difference for our customers, and they are seeing that translate to value for them. So, Kevin, anything else you'd like to add?","Kevin R. Johnson","I'll just sort of punctuate that point, Robyn. First of all, the innovation agenda we're driving creates differentiation, which our strategy is to sell the value in the differentiation we have. That said, we are very aware of the competitive dynamics, and our sales teams are very focused on customer situations. And if we see areas where competitors are getting more aggressive on price, we may decide to be surgical in a certain customer deal or two. But I think as Robyn commented this quarter, we didn't see broad levels of discounting taking place.  But I just want to comment that from a competitive standpoint, we will sell our value, and we're going to be very focused on the customer and the competitive dynamics in that account. And if we need to use price surgically, we will consider and be thoughtful about how to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, I'm trying to reconcile the promising market trends against declining revenues, customer delays and lower operating margins. Why do you think the challenges are temporary in nature? And if the competitive action sort of increasing, do you subscribe to that notion that your large and growing target markets are now just large markets and now there's a structural change to margins for everyone?","Kevin R. Johnson","Well, first of all, I think the market trends -- long-term market trends that we start with would be those of mobile Internet and Cloud computing. In fact, the traffic driven by those market trends continues to grow. That's point number one. Point number two is the transition of how to carry that traffic to packet-switched networking. So the packet-switched networking is a subset of the total capital expenditures of these customers. And then number three, you look at the fact that customers are trying to get more efficiency out of the investment in CapEx, which in order to get that efficiency, we believe very strongly it's a combination of the architectural approach that we've taken with the new network and the innovation that we put into our products. So we think that, number one, the long-term demand trends remain strong; number two, the customer trend and desire to get CapEx more aligned with their revenue is going to make the architectural approach and innovation we're delivering more valuable to them; and number three, I think it's going to come down to how well we compete in the market to earn those opportunities. I do think that there will be places where there will be surgical action taken on price, but I think overall, we feel like we've got differentiation in technology, and that comes from our investment in R&D. And so we've got to lead with that value. And then at the same time, look, we're very aware of the market situation. We're very aware of customers, and we are playing offense. So we'll see how things unfold.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Morgan Keegan and Company.","Simon M. Leopold - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of things. One is probably a tricky question to answer, but needs to be asked anyway is -- in light of a couple of disappointing quarters, I'm trying to figure out how much of your forecast is an effort to be super conservative and cautious, so that you've got a number you're very comfortable meeting, versus how much of this guidance is truly some change in the fundamental demand for your product in the quarter. And maybe you can even tie that to the commentary we've gotten from at least the major Service Providers in the U.S. suggesting that their capital spending would be roughly flat year-over-year, which certainly doesn't align with this first quarter guidance.","Robyn M. Denholm","I'll start with that question and, Kevin, if you want to add anything, please feel free to do so. So in terms of the guidance, we've taken the same approach to our guidance for the first quarter as we typically do. Obviously we always look to refine the approach and improve it and make sure that we're looking at different things from a process perspective, but the philosophy and the approach to the first quarter guidance is consistent with what we've done previously. In terms of how we're looking at things, as we said in the prepared remarks, the demand fundamentals for the markets that we serve are absolutely intact. We continue to see progress in terms of things that are driving the demand for the new network. Our view is that for the first quarter, Service Providers are going to continue to be cautious in their CapEx spending, and we also typically see a seasonal decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in our Enterprise business as well. So that is what we're projecting for the first quarter in terms of guidance.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes. Just to add to that, the macroeconomic situation, I think, in the Enterprise has some implications in financial services. And I think if you look at the financial services sector, you see some of the implications there. And we saw some of those customers push some of the deals out of Q4 into Q1, so there's some question of will they push again from Q1 to Q2, depending on how things unfold in Europe. So there's a little bit of factoring that into the seasonal decline that we normally see in Enterprise from a Q4 to Q1. ","The other factor is in Q4 of 2011, we had a very strong quarter in Federal, which was very unusual. Typically in U.S. Federal, you have your bigger quarter in Q3 and then things decline in Q4, so we had a big federal quarter in Q4, which question is, is that repeatable then in Q1? So there's a couple other things that I think were factored in as we looked at the Q4 to Q1 guide. And then for the Service Providers, as they're shifting to wireless, oftentimes -- it depends customer by customer, but oftentimes, they put a lot of capital first into the radio access network in the access side. And as they do that, that's part of what then allows them to start to generate more traffic from smartphones, tablets, and as they go to LTE even significantly more traffic. And then as that cycle works through, then it puts more traffic demands on the Edge and core of the networks, and that's where we play. So some of this is timing as the wireless investments are made and as that traffic pattern builds up. So those are a couple other factors that were part of the thinking on the guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have 2 questions. And, Kevin, one might be more for you, and then, Robyn, one more for you. I guess question is your revenue levels now are at levels that you might have reached 2 or 3, 3 or 4 years ago, and yet your OpEx is significantly higher. I'm wondering if this revenue level persists, what might trigger you to reconsider where your OpEx levels are? ","And then my second question is, Robyn, if I'm not doing it wrong, I got the DSOs up sequentially, and I would have thought if you had a weak close to the quarter that those might not have been up all that much.","Kevin R. Johnson","I'll take the first one, Robyn, and then let you handle the second one. Yes, Jeff, the approach we're taking is very consistent to the approach we've taken over the last 3.5 years or so as we work through the economic ups and downs of the situations we've managed through over this 3.5-year period. Certainly, our view is this becomes, after Q1, an opportunity for us to continue to grow and, as Robyn commented, improve on operating margins from Q1. And so certainly if we continue to see lower revenue levels, then that's going to prompt us to be much -- to continue to be very thoughtful about what we're doing on the operating expense side. But I think when we look at the product portfolio and when we look at the full year, I think we're going to -- I think we're set up in the right way. We're delivering on the set of products that we've had in the pipeline. But certainly as we see how Q1 unfolds and as we move into Q2, we're going to be very agile and thoughtful in our cost allocation.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. And in terms of the DSO. The DSO was very consistent with last year in terms of the Q4 DSO. It was up sequentially in terms of the third to fourth quarter, but very consistent with what we've seen in prior Q4 DSO trends.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest Securities.","Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I guess, Kevin -- a question for Kevin here. And really taking a step back from Q4 and looking at the trends within the Service Provider business over the last year. Service Provider segment revenue declined sequentially in each quarter during 2011. Your outlook would imply another sequential decline in the Service Provider business in Q1. We've really never seen this 5-quarter, kind of, consecutive decline in the business, and I went back 10 years. So I guess the question is what gives you confidence this is just an industry issue and not some share loss or competitive issue? And then obviously given the strong balance sheet with $4 billion in cash and investments, why would you not consider getting more aggressive on the acquisitions front and try to further diversify away from, kind of, Service Provider environment that continues to be pretty weak here?","Kevin R. Johnson","Let me first comment on your question about market share. And the data point I look at -- we had very, very strong Q1 and Q2 on our router business. In fact, if you look at year-to-date through Q3 -- year-to-date through Q3, our router business was up year-on-year about 19%, and the Infonetics data showed that addressable market was up about 11%. Now certainly we have to see how all the router market gets reported for Q4 and factor that in, but year-to-date through Q3, we were -- routing business was up 19% and addressable market up 11%. So we'll see how that unfolds for Q4, but that's part of -- the thesis is we're watching -- as we're watching this unfold, we had a big cycle, some big deployments in Q1, Q2, then certainly midyear 2011, the concerns about European sovereign debt and some of the other thing started to, perhaps, have some implications in the industry, and we'll see as the data comes out for Q4. ","Second part of your question is around M&A, and I think clearly we continue to drive a strategy that organic R&D is our primary value-creation strategy. We will continue to complement that with acquisitions. And we wanted to focus on acquisitions that are complementary to the R&D strategy, that give us some how synergies in terms of the solution or the technology, the value that we're delivering to customers. And I think over the last 2 years, we've done 6 or 7 different acquisitions that would be characterized probably more as tuck-ins, things that were smaller that had intellectual property and some number of headcount and talent in a certain area. And it was intellectual property that was very complementary to things that we were doing in our overall organic R&D strategy. ","So I think we feel good about the architectural approach that we're taking to market and the different domains of networking that we're participating in. We feel good about this wave of new products. And we're going to always be mindful of what M&A we could do to complement our organic R&D. But I still think that the focus we have is driving an innovation agenda that comes from the talented people that are inventing new architectures and new ways to solve complex problems for our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions. The first one is, you didn't have any 10% customer last year, which is not typical for you. So I was just curious if you look out into this year based on the pipeline of your design wins if you would expect to have a 10% customer again at some point this year. And then the second question was, in the fourth quarter, switching did better than we had expected, and you said, in particular, that QFabric is seeing an excellent response. And so I was just curious if you can just give us some categorical examples of the kinds of customers that are the early adopters of QFabric, whether it's the Federal segment or Internet companies or large enterprises, et cetera.","Kevin R. Johnson","I think the -- on the 10% customer, one of the strategies we articulate is that we are diversifying the customer base. And that's a strategy as much about Service Providers as it is about Enterprise. And we've expanded our go-to-market model in the Service Provider sector, where we are now reaching out to -- with our partners and others to a larger number of Service Providers -- smaller Service Providers, the Tier 3 Service Providers that still make a significant amount of investments in our technology. And so that customer diversification and Service Provider, combined with our growth in the Enterprise and our diversification in the Enterprise, is the reason we have not seen a 10% customer last year. And it's possible we would have a 10% customer this year, but it's probably not a likely scenario. But we'll see how that unfolds. ","In terms of QFabric, and your question about the strong results that we had in switching and fabric, I'll give you a little perspective. We released the QFabric nodes in Q2 -- or in late Q1, basically, and started selling in Q2, and then we released the QFabric Interconnect and Director in Q3, late Q3. So Q4 was the first full quarter that we had the nodes Interconnect and Director available for customer and customers. And that roadmap was all as planned and what we communicated when we announced QFabric. So through Q4 and Q4, we had over 100 customers of QFabric that, at a minimum, had purchased QFabric nodes. And a certain subset of those customers have purchased and are deploying the full QFabric systems. We are very focused on working with those customers to ensure that they have a great customer experience and great early success as they adopt QFabric. ","And strategically, that's important because those customers that have great success, they certainly are willing and enjoy talking to other customers, and it's having those customer references where we can take a customer to go see another customer's implementation of QFabric, hear directly from them, the success that they're having and the good results that they're getting from it, that is in turn creating more interest and more pipeline. The increased pipeline in interest is generating now a lot of energy from our partners. We hosted our Global Partner Conference last week, and we had record attendance at the Global Partner Conference. And in many cases, these are partners that -- some of them are new partners to Juniper and some of them have a significant business and networking today. And one of the big areas of interest for them is being able to grow their business and expand their business with new innovation like QFabric. So we're in the cycle right now where, I think, the demand in the pipeline is growing. And right now we're having to focus on how to build skills. I think now the pipeline and demand is growing at a rate, at a pace where the concern is, are we now building enough skills and capabilities in our partner channel and certainly with the teams in the field that are working with customers to be able to continue to service that demand? So that gives you a little bit of color, a little bit of background on what we're seeing with QFabric.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos from UBS.","Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I had 2 questions. The first one, can you discuss the conversion of orders and backlog to revenue? If I think about the 1.2 book-to-bill and the 1 book-to-bill this quarter, my rough calculations are backlog grew 30% this year. And the revenues don't seem to be converting, so I'm having a hard time understanding that, especially going into the next quarter's guidance. ","And then the second question would be, I know it's early, but based on your discussions with your carrier customers, what do you see the carrier routing market growing this year? Your total router revenue growth about 7% in the full year of 2011. Do you think that's a reasonable target for this year based on your discussions, or do you see that being higher or lower than that?","Robyn M. Denholm","I'll answer the first part of the question, and then Kevin can add to that. In terms of the conversion of book-to-bill, yes, the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.0, so equal to revenue for product book-to-bill. We did have a sequential increase in product-deferred revenue, a slight increase of about 3%. We have grown the backlog. The same phenomena that we had last quarter in terms of the proportion being out. One quarter did not occur in the fourth quarter, so it was a one-quarter phenomenon in the third quarter. So we left the fiscal year of 2011 with a more normal proportion for the first quarter than we would have had if the year was ending at the end of Q3. So the backlog is healthy in terms of our first quarter, the deferred revenue balances are essentially flat year-over-year, and a slight sequential increase from the third to fourth quarter. So in terms of the Q1 demand environment, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are expecting the cautious nature of the Service Provider orders to continue into the first quarter. Obviously with the book-to-bill of 1, you can calculate how many orders we got in the fourth quarter for products. So our view is that continues through the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Rod Hall from JPMorgan Chase.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess the big question is on routing share. And in the data we're presented with, I think, most people on this call would conclude that you're actually losing share in Q4 on carrier routing and that, that probably continues into Q1. Just because the last 2 times we've seen carrier routing, the market declined, as Brent indicated, in 2008 and 2001, so those are pretty tough years. It doesn't feel like it's anything like as bad as that this year, and yet your routing revenues are down. So I guess the question is, do you agree with that? And is that your opinion? You must have an opinion on your routing share. And do you think that it would make sense to get more aggressive on the pricing going forward to preserve your position in routing? And the other thing I'll just toss in there is Cisco clearly indicated more aggression starting back in September. And maybe that happened early in the market, so it seems like they have been putting more pressure on routing in Q4. So just address that for everyone that I think is going to leave this call otherwise concluding that you're losing share, that would be great.","Kevin R. Johnson","Let me take your question, Rod. First of all, I'll just remind you the comment I made on the earlier question. Year-to-date through Q3, our routing revenue had grown 19% versus Infonetics' estimate of the addressable market growing 11%. We'll have to see what the Q4 numbers come out. I do suspect that with the T4000 releasing and the decline that we had in T Series, we may see in the quarter that there was some share loss short-term in the quarter on T Series as we are preparing to ship the T4000. ","On the MX, the MX grew, and so I think on the Edge, I think, we probably are in a different situation on the Edge relative to the core. So we'll have to wait and see how those numbers come out. But I think, overall, we feel good about the product portfolio. We feel good about the value proposition. And the earlier comment I made, we are being very aware of pricing actions and what competitors are doing in specific accounts. And with the big router business and specific accounts, it's an account-by-account opportunity for us to be thoughtful about the value proposition and the set of things we're doing in that account. If we need to be surgical on price for certain things, we certainly are open, and we'll be very thoughtful about doing that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First, is it your expectation to grow the overall business in 2012? And then secondly, you're clearly investing to support the launch of a number of new products despite the lower revenue. So given that scenario, I was hoping you could help us understand how you're thinking about the progression of operating margins in 2012 and help us understand where you think the operating margins may get to by the end of the year.","Robyn M. Denholm","In terms of the question, Jess, thanks for the question, obviously one of our operating principles for the 2012 year is that we expect to grow faster than the markets that we serve. So clearly, we are expecting growth in terms of growing faster than the market. In terms of the operating margin question, we will make progress from the operating margins from the first quarter that I put out in guidance throughout the year, and again that we said in terms of our overall principles for the year. So, Kevin, would you like to add to that?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, I'll just -- a couple of thoughts, and it kind of links back to routers as well. Certainly with the T4000, I think, we said there'll be some revenue recognition late Q1, most likely Q2 with the PTX shipping late in Q1. I think with -- when it comes to core routing and the Converged Supercore, that's really a Q2 through Q4 revenue opportunity for us, which we believe allows us to continue to build on our Q1 revenue streams. And the second point that Robyn made, I think, is very important, which is we look to expand operating margins from our Q1 -- this Q1 base as we go throughout the year, which is a function of a view that we are going to see growth improving as we go forward. And if the volatility in the market or some other reasons indicate that that's not happening, we're going to be very thoughtful and agile on our operating expenses as we've done in the past.","Operator","We have time for one last question. Our last question comes from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One, Robyn, I'm just trying to reconcile understanding the fact that Q1 is seasonally weak. However, you obviously had a pretty good book-to-bill of 1.2 coming out of Q3 with some of the shipments that will, actually, come out in the March quarter. So if anything, I think, despite, sort of, negative seasonality, you should have a little bit of a better Q1 outlook. ","And then second question is just taking up a previous question on, sort of, the growth for 2012. I know you are suggesting that you're going to grow faster than the market. I'm just curious to get your take on what you're thinking about the growth rate for the overall market. I mean, are you thinking the market grows 10% north of that, south of that? Any color would be helpful.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, let me just talk about Q1. In terms of our Q1, we obviously have backlog coming into the first quarter. We did have some of those orders, actually, in the third quarter, as we talked about on the third quarter call. All of those orders are going forward. There isn't any change in that. The booking rate in the fourth quarter as it relates to the book-to-bill for product being 1 was obviously slower than the third quarter. So -- and our view is the rate of orders from the Service Providers are going to continue in terms of their cautious view around CapEx for the first quarter. That is principally the reason for the reduction in terms of the guidance that we put out there on the Service Provider side. ","On the Enterprise side, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we typically see a sequential decline between the fourth and first quarters each year. We're expecting that for the first quarter. And so when you combine a sequential decline for Service Provider and a sequential decline for Enterprise, we get the guidance that we've put out there.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.

These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings.

Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company\u2019s financial results is included in today\u2019s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. We reported solid results during the December quarter. Total revenue of $1.280 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance and we returned to growth on a year-over-year basis. Strength for the quarter was driven by our cloud and enterprise verticals which more than offset expected weakness within our service provider business. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 came in $0.01 above the midpoint of our forecast as top line strength flowed through to the bottom line.","For the year, 2019 played out largely as we anticipated and we were encouraged to finish the year on a high note. Some of the highlights from the year included a third consecutive year of enterprise growth, including a record quarterly performance during the December quarter, a return to year-over-year growth in the cloud vertical following a difficult product transition which we believe will position us for additional growth in the years to come, the successful acquisition of Mist, which is already exceeding our initial expectations and has the potential to have a material positive impact on our P&L on a go forward basis.","Strong software growth that we expect is likely to continue due to the value of our off-box platforms like Contrail and efforts to better monetize the value of our existing solutions and significant progress enhancing our go-to-market organization which we believe will help us capitalize on the various technology innovations we are bringing to market and gain share as many of our markets transitioned over the next 2 years. We expect to build on many of these accomplishments in 2020. We believe we are executing well and positioned to sustainably grow the business starting this year. While this will require some incremental investment, particularly in go-to-market, we remain committed to growing non-GAAP earnings this year and expect the investments we are making in 2020 will create the top line momentum needed to drive incremental leverage and earnings growth in future years.","Now, I would like to provide some insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core verticals. Starting with cloud, we experienced better than expected results during the December quarter as the business grew 18% year-over-year, an increase year-over-year for a third consecutive quarter. We continue to see momentum within our customers, wide area networks, particularly for some of our switching products this past quarter, although our Cloud routing business also saw double-digit growth year-over-year.","Order trends remained healthy and despite some likely seasonality, we are optimistic regarding our ability to once again grow this business on a year-over-year basis during the March quarter. We are encouraged by the success we are seeing with some of our largest cloud customers and continue to believe we are positioned to grow with their capacity requirements now that the MX to PTX transition is largely behind us. That said, we have also been experiencing growth with Tier 2 cloud providers and believe we are gaining share as many of these accounts increasingly leverage their own private clouds.","While our existing cloud use cases should present modest growth opportunities for us over the next few years, we are very much focused on leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture hyperscale switching opportunities inside the data center, where historically we have maintained limited share. On this last point, we believe we have delivered the systems silicon and software needed to win hyperscale switching share during the 400-gig cycle and plan to introduce additional solutions and capabilities over the next few quarters. These solutions are now in our customers\u2019 labs and we remained optimistic regarding our ability to secure wins. While early 400-gig deployments are expected to begin during the second half of the year, we do no expect material revenue to materialize until 2021 due to the availability and cost of optics.","We achieved record enterprise results in the December quarter with this business growing 2% year-over-year despite the difficult comparison. These results were better than expected and we were pleased to grow despite a year-over-year decline in our federal business which moderated following several strong quarters. We believe our portfolio of enterprise solutions is truly differentiated and resonating in the market, which is driving increased confidence that the go-to-market investments we are making should position us to take share and grow this business in the years to come even in a challenging macro environment.","Some of the items driving confidence in our enterprise outlook include the following. First, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased by the momentum we are seeing with Mist and the opportunity to bring AI to the broader enterprise market. Mist is a truly differentiated platform that offers industry leading scale and AI capabilities. Mist AI engine leverages more than 4 years of advanced learning to help customers improve network operations and the user experience as compared to our peers which simply focus on uptime of the network access points, routers and switches. Mist capabilities are clearly resonating in the market. Mist\u2019s customer base grew more than 150% year-over-year in the December quarter and aggregate bookings for Mist and the direct pull-through it enables exceeded $100 million run-rate on an annualized basis. While Mist is already exceeding our initial expectations, we believe we have just scratched the surface of Mist\u2019s potential and the impact it is likely to have on the broader Juniper portfolio.","To this point, we are seeing strong initial demand for our recently launched Mist Wired Assurance that brings cloud management and AI capabilities to the EX portfolio. This capability has already enabled us to secure EX wins with several Fortune 100 accounts, including a Fortune 10 that previously were not Juniper EX customers. We plan to Mistify additional elements of our switching and security portfolio through the year, which we believe should create incremental pull-through opportunities in future periods. We are investing to further monetize Mist with our existing customer base and capture new logos as the industry transitions to Wi-Fi 6 and the AI driven enterprise.","Second, our enterprise switching business is seeing healthy momentum growing both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in the December quarter with our QFX data center products experiencing record orders. We believe our industry-leading EVPN VXLAN capabilities and Contrail Fabric Management software platforms are resonating in the data center market and should position us to grow this business moving forward. While our EX portfolio declined year-over-year, sequential momentum has been strong now for several quarters and we expect to see better year-over-year trends on a go forward basis as the productivity of our go-to-market organization improves after last year\u2019s organizational transformation and the Mist pull-through we are starting to see further materializes.","Third, our secure SD-WAN capabilities are seeing healthy traction. While this opportunity remains in the early innings, we believe our ability to offer cloud management, security and Wi-Fi capabilities is resonating with many of our customers and should not only position us to gain share in what is expected to be a large and fast growing market, but also present another catalyst that helps pull through our broader campus networking portfolio. Our service provider business remains challenged. However, we experienced healthy quarter-over-quarter growth in the December quarter and the pace of year-over-year declines began to moderate, which is a trend that we expect to continue during the upcoming year. The move of our MX 5G line card from qualifications to deployments, the success of our Contrail telco cloud platform, high-end security opportunities and the availability of new edge products are amongst some of the reasons we expect our service provider vertical to present less of a headwind in future periods.","While our security revenue slightly declined year-over-year during Q4, our security orders grew 24% quarter-over-quarter and 3% year-over-year and came in at the highest levels in the last 4 years. We saw notable strength in our mid-range portfolio, which saw orders increase nearly 35% year-over-year and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our high-end offerings. We believe our security portfolio is highly competitive, which was recently validated by NSS Labs, which provided a recommended rating for our high-end data center offerings and Gartner which ranked us as a top supplier for both data center and distributed enterprise security use cases in its critical capabilities report. We are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing and the success of our connected security strategy, which focuses on bundling security with our traditional networking platforms. We think customers are increasingly looking to consume security as part of a networking solution and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.","We are continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 25% year-over-year and accounted for more than 12% of our revenue during the December quarter. While much of our software revenue today is driven by on-box software licenses, our off-box software orders increased more than 90% year-over-year and off-box subscriptions increased more than 170% year-over-year due to Contrail, security subscriptions and Mist. Based on the momentum we are seeing, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time especially as subscription-based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market. Not to be overlooked, our services business delivered a record quarter and the business grew more than 2% on a full year basis. Our services team continues to execute extremely well with improved attach rates and renewals, the primary factor driving strength in both the quarter and the year. Our service pipeline remains healthy and we remain confident in our ability to once again grow this business during the upcoming year.","Finally, I would like to highlight that we are making solid progress in our sales transformation initiatives. Our population of quota carrying sales reps is up by approximately 20% from the trough levels we experienced during the Q1 of 2019 and we are making solid progress against our productivity goals. We believe our investments in go-to-market should create tailwinds through the course of the year and present an important revenue driver that helps us capitalize on the various innovations we are bringing to market, particularly within the enterprise vertical during the upcoming year. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders.","I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.","Ken Miller","Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the full fiscal year and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.208 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 both above the midpoint of guidance. The higher than midpoint results were driven by greater than anticipated strength in cloud, and to a lesser extent, enterprise. As we expected, we are exiting the year stronger than we entered. We are pleased with our 2% year-over-year growth in total revenue.","Looking at our revenue by vertical, on a year-over-year basis, cloud increased 18% and enterprise increased 2%, while service provider declined 5%. On a sequential basis, all verticals, all technologies and all geographies are up. Service provider increased 9% sequentially with growth across all products and services. Enterprise growth of 7% on a sequential basis was primarily driven by switching. Our cloud business increased 3% on a sequential basis primarily driven by routing and services. From a technology perspective, routing grew 4%, switching increased 11% and security grew 7% sequentially. Our services business increased to 3% year-over-year and 7% sequentially primarily due to strong renewals. As Rami mentioned, we saw continued solid performance from our software offerings, which increased 25% year-over-year and was more than 12% of total revenue in the quarter. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 3 were cloud, 6 were service provider, and 1 was an enterprise. Product deferred revenue was $133 million, up 3% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments.","Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Cash flow from operations was $96 million, down sequentially and year-over-year primarily due to timing differences related to payments to suppliers and customer collections. We expect to see a rebound in cash flow in the first quarter when it will likely exceed $200 million. We paid $64 million in dividends reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. We entered into an accelerated share repurchase program for $200 million in shares, which was completed earlier this month.","Moving on to the results for the full year, fiscal 2019 largely played out as we expected with revenue declining 4% versus last year. While the service provider business remained challenged declining 12%, our enterprise business grew for the third consecutive year, and our cloud business returned to full year growth. On a full year basis, security grew 3% year-over-year and our services business grew 2%. Software grew 16% and was greater than 10% of total revenue for the full year. However, routing declined 12% and switching declined 4% versus 2018. Both results were primarily due to weakness in service provider. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 4 were cloud, 5 were service provider and 1 was an enterprise.","Non-GAAP gross margin expanded over 20 basis points due to the strength in our service margin, which more than offset lower product volume and China\u2019s tariffs. Our focus on disciplined non-GAAP operating expense management continued with a decline in operating expenses of $10 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share declined 9%. For the year, we had cash flow from operations of $529 million. During 2019, we took a balanced approach to capital allocation. From a return to shareholder perspective, we repurchased $550 million worth of shares and paid $260 million in dividends totaling 193% of free cash flow. In addition, we used approximately $360 million to acquire Mist, and approximately $450 million to pay down debt.","Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. At the midpoint of our first quarter guidance, we expect year-over-year growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share to grow on a sequential basis and we expect modest growth for the full year. We expect non-GAAP gross margins to experience normal seasonal patterns in the first quarter and improve with volume throughout the course of the year.","While non-GAAP gross margins can be difficult to predict and can be impacted by deal and customer mix, we currently expect full year gross margin to be flat to slightly up versus 2019 levels. We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially due to the reset of variable compensation and typical seasonal increase in fringe costs. Through the course of 2020, we expect quarterly non-GAAP operating expense to remain near Q1 levels. While we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be up on a full year basis, as we invest to take advantage of market opportunities, we remain committed to discipline operating expense management and expect earnings to grow in 2020. For 2020, we expect non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings to be 19% plus or minus 1%. Finally, our Board of Directors has declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.20 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record.","In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success. Now, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.","Ittai Kidron","Thanks. Hey, guys. Nice to see the cloud business clicking again. Can you talk about visibility in the cloud business and revenue concentration there? How has that improved? And as 400 kicks in, I know you\u2019ve talked about more the next year event, but you expect that ramp to be lumpy. How should we think about that?","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks for the question. So first, needless to say, it\u2019s great to see the performance in our cloud business in the Q4 time frame. The year largely played out as we expected, in fact, probably saw a little bit stronger results in the Q4 timeframe than what we had originally anticipated. The success in the hyperscaler is always going to be concentrated and CapEx concentrated. However, I\u2019m pleased with the fact that we saw success across a broad number of customers, not just within the hyperscalars, but also in Tier 2 cloud where I think we\u2019re doing actually quite well. Also the breadth of the technologies with strength in those switching and in routing, that we\u2019re quite pleased with. We have a unique position when it comes to the routing footprint that we retain in the hyperscale space. And we fought hard to retain it, as you know, with the prior transition that we\u2019ve undertaken over the last year and a half. At this point, I think that is largely behind us and we are now in a situation where the strength of the business, the momentum is going to be very much based on the timing of deployments. So that I think gets us to sort of mid to low single digit growth type rates in the cloud segments in the 2020 timeframe. Certainly, as you get into the 400 gig deployments, and in particular, in the data centre and DCI that post, that presents a much bigger opportunity for us to go after. And we\u2019re doing just that. I mean, all of our focus, our energy, our investments are going into the 400 gig system, the software, the specific features that our customers are requiring and we are engaging with our customers in order to have a very good shot at not just getting our fair share, but more than our fair share in that segment. And timing of that is going to be closer to the end of the year into next year for where meaningful revenue happens. And it\u2019s largely tied to the timing of the projects within hyperscale as well as the finding and availability of 400-gig optics.","Ittai Kidron","Got it. And as a follow-up it\u2019s very nice to see that mist is kind of pulling EX, but maybe can you tell us, is that the mode of operation? Do you lead with a bundle right now or mid sales people try to make introductions or \u2013 and vice versa? How much of this is truly the preferred path for you into customers?","Rami Rahim","That\u2019s a great question. I think there are really two sales plays that we undertake when it comes to the enterprise space and the specific customer and their requirements, their presence. So one sales play is very much data center oriented and it is around satisfying the sort of highly automated private cloud data center with a simple fabric management, high performance, EVP and VXLAN type functionality that I think we have real strength and we saw really good momentum in the data center, switching space in the Q4 time-frame, in fact, record orders for the QFX in Q4, largely driven by both cloud as well as the enterprise. The second sales play is very much aligned with what you\u2019re talking about, which is around the campus. And there we are finding a lot of success in leading with Mist, the highly differentiated cloud-based management, AI-driven simplicity and user experience that now allows us to start the conversation to open the door and then to insert EX switching, which I think is leading to the sequential performance that we\u2019re starting to see with the EX portfolio. And I\u2019ll just mention that we just recently introduced functionality that makes that sales play not just one of a commercial play, where we start with one product and then leads us to a conversation with the other, it\u2019s very much a technical tie-in where the Mist cloud, the management, the AI analytics and assurance now actually technically ties in the acts where you give the customer the ability to look at the performance of their network across both wired and wireless and I think that\u2019s a very unique offering that we have now in the market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please proceed.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess supposed to adjusting the free cash flow numbers, historically I think December quarter has been one of the better free cash flow quarters for you guys, the conversion at least versus net income was fairly low. Can we just talk about what happened in the December quarter free cash? When should we expect that to pick-up as you go into the March quarter?","Ken Miller","Yes. So free cash flow was down a little bit compared to our normal kind of seasonal average, primarily just due to timing of both purchases as well as some cash collections from customers. We did see a build-up in deferred revenue and we saw some strong bookings particularly in the services side, service renewals and you see our DSL also went up in the Q4 time period which is not abnormal. We absolutely expect that timing to revert. We expect Q1 to be a strong cash flow quarter for us. In fact, I would expect it to exceed $200 million in Q1. So the cash \u2013 the cash flow that you were expecting to see in Q4 was just pushed down a bit into the Q1 timing.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Really appreciate that. And then, I guess, I\u2019ll just follow up. When I listened to your calendar \u201820 commentary around gross margin being flat to slightly up, OpEx, I think, you said would be up year-over-year as well. What does that embed from a revenue perspective for you guys? Is that going to be some flat volumes or does that factor in some revenue leverage as well? Because, I guess, I would think if revenues are up we would see better leverage, especially in the gross margin line.","Ken Miller","Yes. For revenue, we were comfortable with current Street estimates for 2020, which we\u2019re looking for about 1% growth. From a gross margin perspective, we think flat to slightly up volume would help, but modest growth, call 1% level, it\u2019s not going to have a tremendous impact on gross margins. I\u2019d expect flat to slightly up gross margin perspective. We are driving for a full year earnings growth in 2020 as well.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If I could just start off with the telecom vertical and kind of what\u2019s embedded in terms of revenue outlook. As you mentioned, your full year outlook is for modest revenue growth, but how you think about the telecom vertical within that? And what could potentially drive some upside to the expectations. What do you need to see from the service providers?","Rami Rahim","Yes, certainly, Samik. So, we actually saw a pretty good recovery on a sequential basis in telcos and the service provider vertical in Q4. 2019 was largely played out as we expected, we had expected the second half to be stronger than the first half, and that essentially panned out as expected. A lot of the momentum was in the Q4 timeframe. There is a couple of reasons for this: one is, timing of orders, timing of projects that we had visited into. There\u2019s only so much time that a service provider can go without having to invest in their network. So that certainly benefited us. The other thing that I\u2019d like to call out is, the breadth of the solutions that we\u2019re now selling into the telco domain where we have, obviously, very tight relationships and strategic discussions with is increasing. So not only are we now selling routing technology, which is our traditional business, but we saw good strength in switching and in security. Not to mention in software, in particularly, around the cloud and telco cloud solutions that we\u2019re now offering across a large number of customers. So when I extrapolate out into 2020, I would not return \u2013 I would not estimate or predict a return to growth. I think growth is in the cards for further out in a couple of years timeframe, but for 2020, I\u2019d say, less headwinds supported by some of these other solutions that we are now introducing and selling to our telco customers. I do think that there are going to be some catalysts out there that we can leverage. 5G, although the timing is somewhat unpredictable, I do believe it\u2019s going to be big and it\u2019s going to be a catalyst for investments that will play out over a number of years. Our Metro portfolio which will start to come together for us later this year, I think will be good. Our partnerships, our strategic partnerships with companies like Ericsson, I think starts to help and not to mention just the portfolio. So we introduced last year some pretty meaningful enhancements and upgrades to our MX portfolio and those have gone through certifications. And I think we\u2019ve now started getting into the early deployments I think, starts to benefit us throughout this year.","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. If I can just follow-up, on the last earnings call, you had mentioned you are seeing some weakness in the bookings from the enterprise customers. You had revenue growth with the Enterprise vertical this quarter. But if you can just kind of help us with whatever the trends you saw play-out during the quarter, how did it end the quarter in terms of bookings? How did you end the quarter?","Rami Rahim","Yes. We did mention in Q3 that we were seeing some more caution from some of our Enterprise customers. And I\u2019d say that Q4 played out largely as Q3 did. There is some level of caution that is out there that is maybe delaying some orders, however, look, I mean, we had a good enterprise quarter. I think even in a scenario where there is weakness in the macro, our share in the enterprise vertical leaves a lot of room for growth and I have optimism based on the strength of our portfolio, especially around the data center switching portfolio as well as the campus wired wireless switching solution as well. And couple that with the hard work that the that we did over the last year in restructuring our sales force, cutting in order to invest in front line sellers that we are now starting to see the benefit of. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, compared to trough levels of last year, where we stopped we are now at 20% increase in the number of quota carrying sales reps that are out already. Now many of them are relatively new and are still in the process of becoming fully productive. I think as that happens throughout this year, we\u2019re going to start \u2013 we are going to really benefit from it, especially second half of the year.","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.","Rami Rahim","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask two. The first one is, just maybe if we could double click a little bit on what\u2019s occurring in your gross margins. In other words, I guess I\u2019m trying to get a better understanding of how much of the forecast for the year as well as the March quarter is related to mix, geographies, customer mix, product mix. I know all these sort of factor-in, but maybe if you could help us with a bridge to get an idea of how to model that?","Ken Miller","Yes. So deal mix is very much two factor, I would say. If you look at the full year basis, 2019 versus 2018, the primary driver to the drop-in product gross margin was both tariff and volume. So mix did not play a big factor on full year basis \u201819 versus \u201818 however in a quarterly basis, so for example, Q3 last year versus Q4, the quarter we just ended, you did see some negative mix trends that affected the margin marginally. So any given quarter, it\u2019s going to vary based on deal mix on a kind of a more longer term period, we\u2019re managing it quite effectively. We did see some headwinds last year with tariffs as well as boiling things down. Those are really the two drivers in the product was margin. We saw tremendous strength in service gross margin, which enabled us to deliver fairly flattish, overall gross margins for the company.","Simon Leopold","And then as follow-up, just want to get a better sense of the 400-gig market opportunity. It sounds like you are a little bit more pessimistic about the timing, pushing the volume into 2021. And I guess one of the things I\u2019m trying to understand here is, will you be shipping essentially 400-gig capable chassis in essentially establishing a footprint that might be equipped with 100-gig optics waiting for the optics to be at the right price point or does the whole product cycle really go along with the optics availability and is really a 2021 cycle? Hopefully that makes sense.","Rami Rahim","It certainly does. And let me be clear, I think that\u2019s what we are seeing with respect to the timing of 400-gig. Of the solution, deployments, the opportunity that is there for us is not different than anything that our peers are seeing as well. We\u2019ve done everything that is in our control right now. I mean, retaining our routing footprint was necessary because that gives us an amazing platform off of which to increase our relevance within the cloud vertical and we\u2019ve done that. In terms of the solutions and the product, we already have our first 400-gig systems that are in the market based on both custom and merchant silicon, the new operating system that\u2019s very much developed with our cloud vertical in mind, with the kind of modularity, Linux-native capability, the programmability has now seen its way into the market. We are very much engaged with our customers in early deployments, in early lab certifications. And the timing is essentially tied to the timing that our customers are looking to deploy. And yes, optics plays a big role in the timing and not just the availability of the optics, but also in the \u2013 the economics of those optics.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thank you very much.","Rami Rahim","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Aaron Rakers","Thanks for taking the questions. If I can start just on a strategic basis, one of your biggest competitors has talked recently about selling silicon directly into the cloud verticals, obviously, getting what\u2019s your proprietary silicon strategy? I\u2019m just curious of how you think about whether or not that would present an opportunity for Juniper to do something similar or how you see that engagement possibly, with some of the cloud customers? I do have a follow-up.","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks for the question, Aaron. I will start by just saying that, I have a ton of confidence and I certainly have a lot of experience and background in this domain from my engineering days here at Juniper. In our silicon strategy, in our silicon execution and the strength and the competitiveness of our silicon products that make their way into a variety of our systems, in particular, when it comes to 400-gig, I think we have a unique offering already in the market, but still to come in terms of the full breadth of the solutions that we are bringing to market based both up on merchants silicon, in certain classes of switching silicon, but also on custom silicon that we have developed over the last several years. When it comes to sort of efficiency performance coupled with security and encryption, we really believe that we have done something very special here. So very well equipped to deal with what we know is a competitive environment. Disaggregation, selling software and silicon separately is not a new concept. In fact, I believe architecturally we have done a lot over the last couple of years to disaggregate our software from our silicon in a way that allows us to achieve much more nimbleness in how we develop our systems and can move and adapt to different silicon offerings. That said, in terms of the business model of selling software and silicon separately, we certainly we have experienced, because we have now done this for quite some time in selling software separately from the system and from silicon. We did \u2013 we started this doing \u2013 we started this, years ago. As far as selling silicon separately, while I have confidence in our silicon itself, that business model, I am not sure that there would be a huge market for it, quite frankly. So it\u2019s something that we would be open to, it is something that we would take a close look at going forward. But for now, we\u2019re going to be very focused on selling the systems, the software and the silicon photonics capabilities when they hit the market later this year.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. That\u2019s great answer. And then just as a quick follow-up, just on a model basis back to the gross margin. When I look at gross margin here in this last quarter, you saw a pretty healthy services gross margin. Was there a one-time items in there or how do we think about the services gross margin going forward relative to the \u2013 I think it was 65% you just reported.","Ken Miller","Yes. So services gross margin clearly benefited from the very strong services revenue. As you saw, actually a little bit more less there than we expected beginning in the quarter. The cost is little more fixed. Most of our cost of services is really our \u2013 our services JTech facilities, labs, etcetera. So we are seeing a relatively stable cost line and its revenue ramps sequentially as it did last year. You did see a bigger market than normal. I would expect that to come down a bit in Q1 as revenue seasonally will come down for services and the cost will remain kind of at fixed levels.","Aaron Rakers","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Please proceed.","Jeff Kvaal","Yes, thank you. And Rami, I am hoping to peel back that answer on the independent ship a little bit, why don\u2019t you think that there would be a market for standalone silicon? And then I guess the broader question with that is do you feel like the Cisco announcement makes the web scale market more or potentially less competitive heading into the 400G cycle?","Rami Rahim","I think the cloud demand has always been a very competitive environment and let\u2019s just say that we are very used to and comfortable operating in that competitive environment and doing well despite the competition. Again, I will just reiterate part of my answer I think that there is a large market out there for selling the software. Many of our customers are looking at buying especially off-box software. The opportunity to sell a network operating system disaggregated from silicon, we have a ton of experience here is limited. There are only a few number of customers that are interested in that model. Lot of them talked about it, but ultimately they desire the simplicity of a system that includes the software and in some case merchant silicon, in other cases in custom silicon. As far as selling silicon separately like I said, the focus for us right now is on a technology that we believe has breadth in demand and that is in the 400-gig silicon photonics space. As far as silicon forwarding engines and switch silicon is concerned, I doubt that if we entered that market, we are going to see the other OEMs being customers of ours. So that really limits it to the cloud providers themselves. And based on our conversations, very specific engagements that we are having with them, I think for now the demand is more in the converged systems and meeting their requirements in terms of the programmability, the telemetry capabilities, the power, efficiency, the performance of their requirements that we are confident that we are satisfying.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay, thank you. And then it seems you say that Tier 2 cloud was an area of success for you, how much runway do you have in that? Is that a sustainable theme for 2020 and beyond?","Rami Rahim","I think so yes, because what we are seeing with Tier 2 cloud is. First, there are number of customers that we have seen sort of pivot back to a strategy where they want to deploy their own data centers as opposed to just moving to or embracing the public cloud offering. So that certainly is a trend that will help Tier 2 specifically. Second, not only did we retain customers and saw sort of strength in the build out of data center worldwide, but we have won some new logos that I think will help us in coming quarters.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed.","Alex Henderson","Thank you very much. Just wanted to make sure I understood the mechanics around what you are suggesting for the 2020 timeframe. It sounds like 2% revenue growth, modest increase in gross margins. Are you suggesting that your OpEx increases will be roughly comparable to the revenue growth? And therefore the only margin leverage you will have is slight improvement in gross margin hence operating profit growth fairly consistent with the revenue growth? Is that the way we should be reading the commentary on 2020?","Ken Miller","Yes. So we are comfortable with the current Street revenue estimates for 2020, which are approximately 1% revenue growth. I believe at those kind of revenue numbers we should expect gross margin to be flat to slightly up. OpEx will be up on a full year basis. I do expect us to continue to be opportunistic with our capital return program as well with share buybacks. So the combination of that we believe will get us to earnings growth on a full year basis next year or this year.","Alex Henderson","I see. And just going back to the commentary around the switching market, is your co-packaged technology helping you penetrate into any of the Tier 1 cloud companies where they want to get experience with that co-packaging functionality? It seems that, that\u2019s one of the distinguishing characteristics of your 100-gig products currently and obviously, it would be better to learn about it at 100-gig and then try to deploy it at 400-gig?","Rami Rahim","Alex, I am not sure I fully understand the question, but when I think co-packaging really that comes to co-packaging of optics and switching silicon. That\u2019s something that\u2019s more a future trend that we do believe in, but it\u2019s not a here and now it will actually take a number of years before that becomes a necessity or something that\u2019s technically or economically feasible. Having said that, we do very much believe that our silicon photonics technology, our IP that we have that we are initially embracing to put into standalone pluggable transceivers has future applicability into co-packaging. And that is an outcome that we very much are working towards, but it\u2019s certainly not a here and now, it\u2019s really more of a future trend.","Alex Henderson","Yes, thank you.","Rami Rahim","My pleasure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Ashwin Kesireddy","Hi, thank you for taking my question. This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod. I got one two-part question and one another question on APAC. First on 400-gig, Rami, can you give us an update on the timing of 400-gig silicon photonics and any update on the progress there? And sort of related to that, I wanted to check if you guys are willing to sell 400-gig boxes to run someone else\u2019s software on it? And I have a follow-up.","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks, Ashwin. So silicon photonics, a lot of progress has been made. The big challenge with silicon photonics is not so much about the technology itself. I believe from a technology standpoint we have something that\u2019s unique, highly differentiated in the market today or relative to what\u2019s out there in the market today. The challenges around production manufacturing in large volumes and what we have done over the last several months now is that we have struck up strategic partnerships with strong manufacturing entities, companies, fab houses that specialize in this type of technology that will mitigate the risks associated with the large scale manufacturing of the technology. So at this point, I feel good about the differentiation. I feel good and confident that we are going to get to a solution that we can ship to our customers later this year. And this is not easy, this is certainly a lot of technical hurdles that are in the way, but I do believe that we are overcoming one by one. And like I said, before the end of the year we should have our first products in the market.","As far as your question, yes, a question about 400-gig, so it is \u2013 it\u2019s an interesting question, I actually think the demand \u2013 there is a greater demand for software \u2013 network operating system software that will sit on white box hardware than there is for something that is the other way around. That said, what there is of course an interest in by some of our cloud customers in particular is a very efficient implementation of SONiC on a system that we build that could either be merchant or in some cases custom. And so SONiC as sort of this lightweight NOS, network operating system that some of our cloud customers are asking for, something that we have very much embraced, we have invested in, we have demoed versions of this on our systems that I think have demonstrated to our customers how seriously we are and there is more to come in this space.","Ashwin Kesireddy","Thank you. And just as a follow-up on Asia-Pacific and the revenue growth there, I think that region has been declining for about eight quarters straight now. Just wondering what\u2019s driving that and what could sort of turn around the business there?","Rami Rahim","Yes, I will take that. So, I think part of this has to do with the fact that some of our big customers in the APAC region, we really had \u2013 we had some level of concentration, especially in the telco space and to a lesser degree in the cloud space that \u2013 just we are not spending as much over the last few quarters as they had done traditionally and that resulted in some weakness. I also just would acknowledge, I think we have had some execution challenges in Asia-Pacific that we have had to address and we are actually going to be announcing a new APAC leader fairly imminently at this point.","Ken Miller","Yes. I would just add that we did see two consecutive quarters of sequential growth in Asia-Pac and we did see enterprise up on a year-on-your basis. So we are seeing some pockets of strength there. I think there is more to come. I would expect all of our geographies to have the potential to grow in 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Meta Marshall","Great. Thanks, guys. You spoke about the 20% increase in quota-carrying comps and I just wanted to kind of check and make sure that kind of all positions that you were looking to hire for are filled at this point and then just increases in OpEx throughout 2020 are just more commissions as they become productive? And then I have a second question.","Rami Rahim","Yes, thanks for the questions. So, most of the positions have been filled. Our OpEx outlook certainly factors in both the filled positions and those that we anticipate will be filled shortly. And I just highlight the fact that we took the harder path here of cutting to invest. We have restructured. We reduced layers and increased span of control and simplified the organization, which freed up the capacity for us to go and to invest in frontline sellers and I think that has \u2013 that was tough to do, but it was the right thing to do. So certainly, you will not see a 20% increase in OpEx for our sales organization, but it\u2019s great to see that we are going to have 20% more sellers that are actively positioning and selling the technology and the differentiation that we believe we have, especially in the enterprise space.","Meta Marshall","Got it. And then just maybe on the CTO transition, just any kind of customer feedback or kind of as Raj starts making the rounds with customers any kind of early commentary would be helpful? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks for the question. I think that the CTO transition has gone remarkably smoothly. Bikash did a very nice job in sort of seamlessly transition over to Raj. There was in fact a period of overlap between the two executives. Raj is an outstanding technical leader that has experience in the cloud provider space, but also in the enterprise, was at Intel for a number of years, so has some experience in the silicon photonics space, at VMware, lot of experience in enterprise software. So, I think the breadth of his experience has already in just the month or two that he has been onboard been a huge benefit to us and I think he is going to do a fantastic job leading the technical strategy in this company going forward.","Meta Marshall","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks guys for taking the question. And I will apologize because I am going to ask you to revisit some questions from earlier. First off, Ken, on the margin questions you have been asked, a couple of things. One, I thought that the announced reduction in the last round of tariffs, I thought that, that would benefit you and your peers, will that not be the case? Secondly, what is the rate of price erosion, has that changed one way or the other? I assume from your margin guidance, it hasn\u2019t. And third, going back to Simon\u2019s question, when we think about the levers going forward, it sounds like mix is the number one lever. If I look at what you did back when before you had the whole MX to PTX and the impact to new revenue, you were doing 64 and 63 off several 100 million or higher revenue. Is it to get back to that level or to get back to the 62 plus, is it primarily a function of better volumes that magnitude or is there something else? And then I have got a straightforward question Rami in your response to the demand question, if I may?","Rami Rahim","Yes. So with respect to tariffs, first, I would say that we have been predicting tariffs would impact our business by 30 to 50 basis points for the year and that\u2019s largely played out as we expected. I would remind you that\u2019s a total gross margin impact. If you actually take the impact of product gross margin, it\u2019s greater than that as the denominator gets smaller, right. So if you look at product only gross margin, the tariff impact is greater than 30 to 50 basis points. As it relates to Wave 4 and the change there, we did not see a benefit in time to impact Q2. We will slightly benefit from that in the Q1 tariffs. But our biggest opportunity is to continue to mitigate the entirety of the tariff as we continue to look at retooling our supply chain. So, that\u2019s something that\u2019s ongoing. We weren\u2019t able to mitigate much in Q4. In fact, our Q4 tariff exposure was the highest of any of the quarters in 2019 which is time, just not having enough time to really react to Wave 4. We are now reacting and we expect to be able to mitigate some tariff impact going forward. As far as the big levers, I would order them and volume is number one. I mean, we did although we are pleased with our Q4 returned to growth we are still seeing product revenue down. That is obviously a negative to our gross margin, our product gross margin in particular. So getting the volume back would be number one. Obviously, if we can mitigate tariffs further that would help. And last but not least, on a mixed perspective, as our software business continues to get stronger, particularly as we start to get more renewals in our subscription software business, we should see some lift in our software margin as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Yun with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Brian Yun","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Also I had kind of a question on 2020 outlook, mainly the levers for sort of top line growth. Wondering in your view sort of what those are that can kind of cause revenue to perform better than expected and then any headwinds or speed bumps we should kind of be aware of in 2020, maybe if you could talk about the cloud and enterprise vertical, I think you touched on service provider earlier? So that would that would be helpful. Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks, Brian. Let me start and maybe Ken has something to add. And it\u2019s best to think about it from the standpoint of verticals. I think in the cloud space we saw good \u2013 we closed the year strong in 2019. I wouldn\u2019t expect that Q4 performance is sort of sustainable on an ongoing basis based purely on the footprint that we have. I think sort of mid single-digit \u2013 mid to low single-digit growth rates in the cloud provider space based on existing footprint is a reasonable assumption. In the enterprise space, I would say continued momentum and if anything maybe even better strength in the second half of the year as we get to more productivity with the increased number of sellers that we have, that\u2019s out there not to mention the continuously increasing strength of our joint portfolio. So, the EX switching portfolio being managed by the Mist cloud, the initial versions of that have now entered the market, it\u2019s only going to get stronger and more competitive throughout the year. So I am quite optimistic about the enterprise vertical in 2020. And I think that\u2019s going to be a good growth catalyst for us. In SP, it\u2019s moderating declines, right, sort of mid single-digit declines in SP is probably in the right ballpark. And it\u2019s based on a number of factors that have already highlighted around the fact that SPs need to invest eventually, 5G becoming more of a catalyst to investments, the fact that we are broadening our solutions in our portfolio that we are selling to the SP into software switching and security. That\u2019s how we think about it.","Ken Miller","No, I think that makes sense. I think if you wanted to ask what could go wrong, I would say, clearly the enterprise business operating in that dynamic macro environment, if that were to change materially that could have an impact on our ability to grow enterprise, Rami already mentioned kind of service provider and cloud.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Tejas Venkatesh with UBS. Please proceed.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you. I have two questions. You had new MX and PTX products out in the market recently, I wonder if you could update us on the uptake and refresh opportunities? And then secondly, you have talked about switching strength into when opportunities in the cloud, I wonder if you could clarify whether these were new wins that were coming through? Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Yes. So as far as the routing products, MX and PTX, I think we have now seen a few quarters of PTX momentum driven largely by the cloud vertical. And I am quite optimistic that, that can continue. The MX, we introduced new MX 5G line cards, roughly at first half of last year timeframe. Those typically take 6 months to 9 months of certification. That has happened now over the last couple of quarters. And I think that starts to result in some growth opportunities for us into 2020. And I think the second question was around switching in the cloud provider space and whether there were net new logos? And the answer is, yes, in the Tier 2 space I think we have seen momentum as a result of both satisfying the growth demand of Tier 2 clouds, especially Tier 2 cloud providers that have made a strategic decision to either stick with or to in-source their data center infrastructure, but also net new logos worldwide that I think will help us throughout this year.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jess Lubert","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-K, the press release and CFO commentary, furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company\u2019s financial results is included in today\u2019s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. We reported mixed results during the September quarter. Total revenue of $1.133 billion was slightly below midpoint of our guidance due to weaker than expected trends within our service provider business.","Challenges within this vertical more than offset healthy cloud and enterprise sales, both of which grew year-over-year. Non-GAAP, earnings per share of $0.48 came in $0.02 above the midpoint of our forecast as better than expected non-GAAP gross margins and strong cost controls more than offset the impact from our incremental China tariffs.","While we remain on track to deliver a return to year-over-year growth during the December quarter, we are now expecting a lower level of growth than we previously anticipated. The change versus our prior expectations reflects our belief that the Service Provider weakness we experienced over the last few quarters is likely to continue and that our enterprise momentum will moderate from recent levels based on the order trends we experienced this past quarter.","We believe these dynamics will more than offset the improved momentum we're seeing with our cloud customers. We believe we are executing well in a dynamic environment. We continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects of our business, and we are investing to win in each of our core markets, many of which are expected to undergo material technology transitions over the next few years.","Typically, transitions present opportunities to gain share and we believe we have the right products, strategy, and go-to-market motions needed to capitalize on the 5G, 400 gig enterprise multicloud, and WiFi 6 opportunities that are likely to play-out over the next several years.","Given our conviction in our prospects and belief that the innovations we are bringing to market should position us to drive a sustainable return to modest growth starting next year, our board has increased our buyback authorization by $1 billion, and we intend to enter into a $200 million ASR this quarter.","Now, I'd like to provide some insight into the September quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core verticals. Starting with the positive, we experienced a second consecutive quarter of improved trends within our cloud business during the September quarter, which grew 6% year-over-year as we continue to see momentum within our customers\u2019 wide area network, particularly from some of our Switching Products this past quarter.","Order trends remained healthy and we are optimistic regarding our ability to once again grow this business year-over-year during the December quarter. We're encouraged by the success we are seeing within our cloud customers\u2019 wide area network and continue to believe we are positioned to grow with their capacity requirements in this segment now that the MX to PTX transition is largely behind us.","While cloud wide area spending trends should present growth opportunities for us over the next few years, we are very much focused on leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture hyperscale switching opportunities, where historically we have maintained limited share.","On this last point, we've started to deliver the systems, silicon, and software needed to win hyperscale switching share during the 400-gig cycle, and plan to introduce additional solutions and capabilities over the next few quarters. We have started to introduce these solutions into our customers\u2019 labs and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to secure wins or even a modest level of success could present material tailwind for our business in the years to come.","Within our service provider vertical, we experienced weaker than expected trends during the September quarter with this business declining 17% year-over-year due to ongoing challenges many of our carrier customers are facing.","While our carrier relationships remain strong, we did see a number of expected projects push out of the quarter as many of these customers are choosing to run their networks harder, some are capital constrained, and others have shifted resources to spectrum licenses and RAN build-outs.","Despite these challenges, we do expect our service provider business to experience sequential growth during the December quarter and see more modest year-over-year declines in 2020. The move of our MX 5G line cards from qualification to deployment, the success of our Contrail Telco Cloud platform, and the availability of new access products are some of the reasons we expect our Service Provider vertical to present less of a headwind in future periods.","While we reported very healthy enterprise revenue during Q3 with this business growing 8% year-over-year, we saw a deceleration in orders toward the end of the period that is leading us to moderate our enterprise expectations for the remainder of the year. We believe this deceleration was due to lingering effects associated with the sales transformation actions we took earlier in the year and macro related weakening in the customer spending environment.","Despite these dynamics, we are seeing some pockets of strengths within our enterprise business that are providing optimism and longer-term prospects for this business. First, our QFX switching business experienced growth both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis.","QFX orders grew 20% year-over-year driven by improved demand within the cloud as well as enterprise datacenter market. We believe our industry leading EVPN-VXLAN capabilities and Contrail fabric management software are resonating in the datacenter market and should position us to grow this business moving forward.","Second, I'm pleased by the momentum we are seeing with Mist and the opportunity to bring AI to the broader Enterprise market. While the numbers remain small, the momentum we are seeing is real, and I am increasingly convinced that Mist and the associated pull through it enables should become a material driver for Juniper in 2020.","To this point, Mist customer base has grown 42% since we closed the deal and doubled year-over-year; two proof points of the momentum we are seeing. It's also worth mentioning we secured over 100 new Mist customer proof-of-concepts in just this past quarter, more than 80% of which included an EX or SRX opportunity.","We believe we have just scratched the surface of Mist potential and we are investing to further monetize our existing customer base and capture new logos as the industry transitions to WiFi 6 and the AI driven enterprise. The WiFi 6 refresh and Mist differentiator architecture is already enabling us to win wireless and wired opportunities we previously were unable to address and should present further tailwind in the year to come.","Third, our SD-WAN capabilities are starting to see healthy traction in the market. While this opportunity remains in the very early innings, we believe our ability to offer cloud management, security, and WiFi capabilities is resonating with many of our customers and should not only position us to gain share in what is likely to be a large and fast growing market, but it also presents another catalyst that helps pull through our broader campus networking portfolio.","I think it's important to highlight that our security business is continuing to see strength with this business growing 22% year-over-year in the September quarter, driven by strength at the high-end and mid-range of our portfolio. While we do not expect our security business to sustain the level of growth we experienced in Q3, we are encouraged by the momentum we're seeing and the success of our secured networking strategy which focuses on bundling security with our networking platforms across several customer use cases.","We think customers are increasingly looking to consume security as part of a networking solution and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. We're also continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 13% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 10% of revenue during the September quarter. While much of our software revenue today is driven by on-box software licenses, our off-box software orders increased more than 100% year-over-year and off-box subscriptions increased more than 200% year-over-year due to Contrail, security subscriptions and Mist.","Based on the momentum we're seeing, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time especially a subscription based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market.","Before I turn it over to Ken, I'd like to touch upon where we are with our sales transformation efforts which were set into motion under the leadership of Marcus Jewell earlier this year. The goal of these initiatives is to drive improved sales productivity by leveraging a more data-oriented approach, putting the right sales incentives into place to encourage the best behaviors and identifying areas of potential savings that could be reinvested into additional quota carrying sales teams.","I firmly believe these actions will not only position us to grow on a sustainable basis, but also to take advantage of the innovations we are delivering across our portfolio to take share. However, with an organizational change of this magnitude, it is not uncommon to see an elevated level of turnover for a short period of time, which is something we encountered earlier this year. While this disruption was largely behind us exiting the June quarter and we have made solid progress versus our hiring goals year-to-date, we have not been able to fill our open positions as quickly as we would have liked and many of our newer sellers are now early in the process of ramping to productivity.","The combination of which has slightly impacted the trajectory of our enterprise orders. This disruption along with the emergence of some macro related caution has caused us to expect a slightly more conservative enterprise revenue outlook for the December quarter. Longer term, I believe the investments we are making in our go-to-market organization along with the products and innovations we're bringing to market are the right ones and should position us to deliver a return to modest growth next year.","I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders.","I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.","Ken Miller","Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. Our third quarter results were mixed with total revenue of $1.133 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially but slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin of 61.1% was 1.1 points higher than the midpoint of our guidance. This strength was driven by favorable deal mix and improved inventory management.","Gross margin strength as well as prudent operating expense management drove the non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48, $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Looking at our revenue by vertical on a year-over-year basis, Cloud increased 6% and we are pleased with the return to growth in this vertical.","While Enterprise revenue increased 8% year-over-year, we did see some weakness in bookings towards the end of the quarter. Finally, Service Provider declined 17% year-over-year, which was weaker than expected. On a sequential basis, Enterprise increased 10%; Service Provider increased 1% and Cloud was down 5%.","From a technology perspective, Switching increased 9%, Security increased 22% while Routing decreased 18% year-over-year. Software revenue continued to grow, increasing 13% year-over-year and was approximately 10% of total revenue. Our services business increased 1% year-over-year and was flat sequentially.","In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, three were Cloud, six were Service Provider and one was an Enterprise. Product deferred revenue was $129 million, down 3% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year and up 1% sequentially.","Looking at our balance sheet, total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion. We generated solid cash flow from operations of $185 million for the third quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to lower payments to suppliers and lower cash tax payments, partially offset by higher payments related to variable compensation.","I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our revenue outlook shows a modest return to year-over-year growth at the midpoint. However, it is lower than previously expected due to continued business challenges as some of our largest Service Provider customers, lingering impacts from our sales force transformation and macroeconomic uncertainty. We remain confident in our position in the markets we serve, and in our relationships with our customers.","Our fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP gross margin guidance reflects the recent increase in China tariffs, which is offset partially by the expected increase in revenue. We continue to undertake specific efforts to improve our gross margin. These efforts include value engineering, optimizing our supply chain and service business, pricing management and increased software and solution sales.","We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17% in the fourth quarter due to the anticipated reduction in India's corporate tax rate. Despite the lower than expected revenue outlook, we continue to manage costs prudently, and still expect to achieve the low-end of our $1.70 to $1.80 earnings range for the full-year 2019.","As Rami mentioned, our board of directors has approved an additional $1 billion of share repurchase authorization, which brings our current authorization to $1.9 billion. In addition, we intend to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program for $200 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect to be opportunistic on future capital returns.","In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.","Now I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Kvaal","Thank you, gentlemen. I guess, I would love Rami if you would spend a little bit more time adding some color to your commentary about starting to deliver software and silicon into some hyperscale for testing. What does that mean in terms of how deep in the process you are with them? What are some of the milestones and timing that we can look for over the next quarter or so?","Rami Rahim","Thanks for the question, Jeff. So first, as a bit of a context here, I'm pleased with the results in the cloud provider space in the Q3 timeframe. It is in no little part due to the really amazing efforts of the engineering team, our sales team, and what is essentially a pretty impactful product transition from MX to PTX. The net of it is now we're in a position where we have retained the footprint that honestly leaves Juniper in a very unique position in terms of share in the routing space.","Now that allows us to grow with the capacity requirements of our cloud provider customers, and it also allows us to focus on net new footprint, in particular around 400 gig. And the 400 gig opportunity will initially be in the data center interconnect and the data center switching opportunity, and will eventually expand to more use cases.","From a technology standpoint, we've already released into the market the new Junos operating system that has been designed very purposefully for the cloud provider space. So, it has all of the capabilities, the Linux-native capabilities, modularity, the programmability, the telemetry aspects of what we know our cloud providers need and want. We also have our very first systems based both on merchant silicon and custom silicon offerings that run that operating system and there will be more to come.","So, we're working on a roadmap of different systems with different capacities that will be delivered over the next couple of quarters. In terms of the engagement with our customers, it's very strong. We have the initial proof-of-concepts that are already in flight right now. We are not confused about the fact that it's going to be a very competitive space because the opportunities are lucrative, but I think that we are well positioned to gain more than our fair share.","And even a small share take in this space would be quite meaningful in terms of the tailwinds it will give us starting next year. Time wise, I expect that the initial deployments for 400 gig will be in the second half of next year, and that's very much time to the availability of 400 gig optics. And I just remind you that that includes both the third-party 400 gig optics, but also Juniper\u2019s own 400 gig optics through our silicon-photonics project that is currently underway.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay. Super. And then, Ken, perhaps a clarification, you talked about modest growth starting next year. How does that compare to the modest growth in the fourth quarter and how should we think about that over the course of the year? Thank you.","Ken Miller","Yes, thanks Jeff. So while we remain opportunistic about our long-term growth prospects, and we are going to be looking for growth in 2020, I do think it's important to note that we are seeing some additional surge about a weakness and some macroeconomic uncertainties. Therefore, I really would caution you to be, conservative with your models, and we'll provide more detail later on 2020, but flat-to-low, single-digit growth would be a good way to think about 2020 at this point in time given some of the uncertainties that we see out there in the markets that we serve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yun with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Yun","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So you mentioned, weakening enterprise outlook. I was wondering if you could expand on what you're seeing there. Is this a Juniper-specific issue due to the enterprise transformation kind of sales force initiatives you detailed or are you also seeing a broader enterprise market environment?","Rami Rahim","Yes, thanks for the question, Brian. First, I should say that we're really pleased with the revenue performance that we saw in the enterprise space in Q3 timeframe, both year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter growth across pretty much all technologies and geos. Real great strengths in Q3 in our federal business in particular helped the performance in the Enterprise space. We did mention that, yes, near the end of the quarter, we started to see some weakening of orders and there are really a couple of factors that have impacted the business and they're roughly equal in terms of the total impact.","First is the sales transition. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the issue there is really around the fact that we have a lot of new sellers that are not quite as productive as sellers that have been in seat for quite some time. We haven't been able to fill the open wrecks that we created as a part of the transition as quickly as we would like. That of course, it resolved itself over time. And in fact, I expect that to fully be beneficial to the business over the next few quarters. But in addition to that and separate to that, I do believe that there have been some overall macroeconomic factors that have impacted the timing of orders.","So, what we saw are some of the opportunities that we were competing for took longer to close, some moved out into Q4 and into next year. And I'd say that that's a really a very orthogonal issue and one that's somewhat out of our control. We're going to focus on what we can control, which is really around getting through the sales transformation. The good news about that is the hard part, it is really behind us at this point and it is really around rebuilding and getting our new sellers as productive as possible in the shorter timeframe as possible.","Brian Yun","Great. Thanks Rami. And Ken, maybe one for you, on gross margins, you outlined various margin improvement initiatives. Can you talk about which ones are more the immediate opportunities versus the longer-term opportunities? I'd imagine that increasing software sales that's more longer term, whereas supply chain optimization or pricing management that could be more near-term. Is that the right way to think about it? And if you could quantify any of those 2020 and beyond, that'd be helpful. Thank you.","Ken Miller","Yes, I do think that\u2019s the right way to think about it as far as kind of what's been impacting us to date, pricing, supply chain management, obviously mitigating the tariffs have been a big focus over the last several quarters, and we've done a pretty good job on all those regards. Value engineering and design for value was longer term. However, I would say that we've been working on it for a few years, right. So, as we introduce new products this year and into next year and beyond, we are very focused on the cost of those products and really some of that will pay off over the long-term.","So, at this point in time, all of the attributes are starting to benefit us because we are in a cycle where some products are coming to market that we started value engineering work a year or two ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could maybe triangulate the disclosures you offer on products and verticals, specifically seeing a lot of strength in your security business, and strength in switching, coincident with strength in the enterprise vertical. And so I want to see if we can get a better understanding of what's specifically going on with enterprise customers since I think historically, many folks associate security with enterprise and switching with cloud. And I think it's probably much more nuanced, if you could double click on that topic.","Rami Rahim","Happy to, Simon. So you're roughly right. There\u2019s a big element of security and switching that's tied to enterprise momentum at Juniper. But I think if you take a look at both of these technology areas, the strength is actually somewhat broad-based. So in switching, we saw strength in the enterprise, but we also saw strength in the cloud provider in particular, the hyperscale cloud provider space. In Security, I think we saw strength really all up across all of the verticals and it's very much, I think an artifacts of the technology that we're developing and solutions and use cases that we're addressing. So take for example, switching really it's around 100 gig. That's very interesting to the hyperscale space. It's also very interesting to large enterprises that are building out their own private data centers.","We have implemented really world-class protocol technologies like EVPN-VXLAN on our 100 gig switches that make it well suited for, again, large enterprises that are building out their own data centers. It goes without saying, I'm really pleased with the performance that we saw in security. And again, broad base across SPs, cloud providers and enterprise up 22% year-over-year. There, the strength was mainly in areas where there is a combination of features that are required, efficacy of stopping attacks and also performance.","So large enterprise, cloud providers, service providers that are securing mobile infrastructure, users, data, this is where we have some unique strengths that we are benefiting from right now in the security space. I would not expect this kind of performance in security on an ongoing basis. I think we benefit from a little bit of an easy compare in Q3 and the compare gets much more difficult, as you look into Q4. But nonetheless, I do have confidence in the trajectory of security across all our verticals going forward.","Simon Leopold","Great. And one quick follow-up, you did in an earlier question indicate that you expected your optics products would be part of the availability ramp in the second half of 2020. And I am interpreting that comment to mean that you're on track and that your silicon-based photonics are going to be available around the turn of the calendar year, but your expectation is that they would be volume production in the second half of calendar 2020, am I understanding this correctly?","Rami Rahim","We will introduce \u2013 our plan is to introduce 400 gig silicon-photonics based optics next year and with certainly in volume by the end of the year and sort of the specific milestones to get us there. We're not really ready to talk about that right now. The most important thing is to catch the beginning of the 400 gig wave. And I believe that we can do that.","At this point, just to give you a bit more color on where we are. We have confidence in the technology because we proved it out in a lab environment. I think it's really going to be differentiated, but we still have work to do in terms of making it available and at scale. And in order to de-risk that, we have signed strategic partnerships with fab houses that are out there that specialized in taking technology like this and manufacturing it in volume.","I would say that most of the risk is behind us, but there's still a lot of work ahead of us in order to get to the important ship dates next year. So in summary, I think if \u2013 when we deliver it should be really right at the sweet spot of the growth in 400 gig next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off with a question, primarily around kind of Mist and I got few other comments that you had on the strength you are seeing with Mist Systems and we\u2019re hearing the same from customers that we are talking to.","Just want to see what, how you're kind of thinking about the pull through of other products, particularly some of the campus switching portfolio with the strength you're seeing in Mist. Because I think last quarter when you spoke about Mist, you mentioned, you will have a separate specialist team for it. So do you need more integration or kind of more of those go-to-market motion to be able to drive more pull towards your other products with Mist?","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks for the question, Samik. So interest level in Mist is very high both from our customers and importantly from our own sales teams that are very excited about positioning and competing with the technology, I mentioned the proof points, the customer base for Mist has now grown by 40% since the close of the transaction. You're right that there is a significant opportunity to pull through additional Juniper products and that was part of the synergy thesis behind the acquisition that we've made.","And thus far what we are seeing in many of the net new customers that we are winning. There is in fact a significant portion or opportunity of attached for both switching and security, in particular switching. So many people who look at Mist and think of it as primarily filling a wireless LAN gap in our portfolio are honestly missing the bigger picture, which is that Mist offers the framework of cloud management and analytics and AI that can simplify the job of a network operator and enhanced the end user experience. What we want to do now is expand that to include other portfolio \u2013 enterprise portfolio products in Juniper. The first of which will be EX. And we're seeing a very high level of interest from our customers from doing that and we're executing on that roadmap as we speak.","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. I just want to follow up quickly on the 400 gig data center switching opportunities that you've talked about and you gave quite a bit of details on that already. I just wanted to understand, you mentioned you're trialing with both merchant silicone-based solution as well as the custom silicon solution. What do you \u2013 how do you feel about the rate of positioning of those products as well as the differentiation that you have? And which one do you think will be the preferred solution for the hyperscalers to go with?","Rami Rahim","Yes, I appreciate the question. I should clarify that we don't see those products addressing the same use case. So we have chosen to use merchant silicon in certain parts of the network. For example, the access layers of a service provider or a cloud WAN deployment or the top of rack in \u2013 first level access and aggregation within a hyperscale network. The custom solutions that we're offering address more of a spine layer within the data center, data center interconnect, wide area deployments in the cloud provider space as well as the service provider space.","So they're very much complimentary. To your question around differentiation, I feel very good. I think we have both the goods that are necessary in software with our new Junos evolved software that gives the modularity, the programmability, the telemetry capabilities that our customers need. It is the most modern operating system that's now out in the industry. And now couple that with the silicon offering that give I think an advantage to our customers in terms of price performance and honestly, the gravy on top it would be silicon-photonics once we introduced that capability into the market next year.","Samik Chatterjee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Long","Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up if I could, first, Rami, could you just go back to the kind of the whole campus WiFi area obviously, Mist is off to a good start as a part of the portfolio here, but it seems to be a time, if you could talk a little bit about competition, obviously Cisco has a product cycle and HP seems to be reinvesting and Arista is trying to do a better job as well there. So just talk a little bit about what you're seeing competitively there. And then the second one is on the Service Providers side, I mean you're not alone here seeing the weakness. In your view, what is it going to take to turn this business around more broadly, this vertical? Does it have to be 5G or is there something else that you see over the next several quarters that can maybe reverse the trend that we've seen across the SP markets? Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Okay. For the questions, Tim. So first Mist, I think the level of differentiation that we have right now with Mist is truly unique compared to any competitive offerings that are out there. I think that the competitive advantage that we have is measured in the years, not less than that.","And I truly do believe now having a much closer view of the technology as they are part of the Juniper family. That in order to achieve the kind of cloud-native management and AI capabilities that Mist offers, you have to start from scratch. You have to build a true cloud-native management solution from the beginning. And that's something that Mist started to do \u2013 the Mist team started to do years ago and now we are benefiting from that today. So I feel very confident about the differentiation, but more importantly the proof points of that confidence in terms of wins in the market and new opportunities, net new accounts is absolutely there.","As we take that technology and extend it across other portfolio products, the most obvious one would be our EX campus wired switching portfolio. I think we will get additional lift in that area. On the Service Provider space, the business challenges that we're seeing right now are not new. We have been citing this now for a number of quarters and yes, you're right, our peer, they're also seeing some of these.","I think that we're already dealing with limited budgets and flattish CapEx environment with SP customers and now what they're doing is reprioritizing investments so that \u2013 they're addressing spectrum and ran build out first. And that means that they have less to invest in IP. Having said that, there is a positive side to the story, which is that to the extent that 5G RAN and radio becomes a reality, access networks get built out. That means that there's more traffic that needs to be carried within the service provider, core and edge networks where we have strength.","So, this is not something that I expect we will benefit from anytime soon. It's not going to be a next quarter thing. But I do believe that this will be a catalyst over time, measured in many quarters, that will help us benefits from net new investments in the SP space.","Additionally, all telcos today are thinking about how they can change their networks and their operations to reap the efficiency and agility benefits of cloud. And we've got the premiere telco cloud software stack that's available in the market today with Contrail cloud. And we're seeing that evidenced by net new wins, which is great and encouraging, but it's early days to the extent that 5G deployments start to really get built out. And the services over 5G become virtualized.","I think we benefit from that with the wins that we have at \u2013 we have had to-date. So these are a couple of factors that I think would be required in order to change the trajectory of our SP business. I do think next year the headwinds in SP will be less than what we have been experiencing this year.","Tim Long","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Rod Hall","Yes. Hey guys, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to, I guess ask a couple of questions. One is on 400 gig and the proof-of-concept trial that you're involved in, could you say, are there any situations where other operating systems are being used on your switches or is it all Junos? And just talk us through kind of the operating system, competitive environment as well, is it the likely suspects, are there new OSs emerging, et cetera, just interested in that.","And then secondly, wanted to go back to service providers, I know it's kind of be beaten up. And I, just a structural question on service providers, are you seeing any change in what types of routing ports people are buying? Like are you, are we seeing any structural changes here that are putting pressure on the service provider market or is it strictly, being delayed ahead of 5G and architectural decisions and things like that? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yes, thanks for the questions Rod. On 400 gig, the question around other operating systems running on our hardware, no, I have not heard of that and I doubt that that's actually happening. More broadly for, I think your question was about sort of the competitive nature of the different software stacks that are available. And we've been working on our Junos Evolved software now for a number of years and we have done so with a very tight eye on and engagement with our cloud provider customers.","So we've developed it to address the most pressing, requirements of our cloud customers, which gives me the confidence that, we've developed the right stack, that allows us to compete effectively in that space. In the service provider space, no, not really. I'm not seeing any sort of, I don\u2019t know, architectural or structural changes, as you know, we have the benefit of both these scale ups, like the traditional MX routing technology as well as scale-out with PTX and QFX.","I would argue that we probably have the most experience right now among all of our peers in that transition from scale up to scale out because of what we have done with our hyperscale customers. But having said that, I would, I would just reiterate what I've said in the past that I do not see, a rapid transition from one architecture to another the way that we have seen it in the cloud space, and there are reasons for this.","I mean, SP used cases, the services that they deliver tend to be more complicated. They're much more tied to the underlying networking infrastructure. And so whereas that transition might happen over time, I think it's going to be in a much longer timeframe than that we experienced in the cloud space.","Rod Hall","Okay. Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Ittai Kidron","Hey guys, couple for me. First for you Rami on the hiring front, you've kind of mentioned that you're not clicking as fast as you do like on that front. Is this an HR issue or is this just a talent availability? It's just not out there. Is there no way to may perhaps repurpose some of your service provider people, it seems to be growing capacity there, maybe they can really repurpose.","And then for Ken on the buyback front, great to see the expansion there. But why only 200 million? I guess I'm kind of wondering with the portfolio revolving and the opportunities seem to be gradually kind of working for you. Why not be more aggressive on the buy-back near term, or rather than just $200 million, it feels like there's more that you can do there near term.","Rami Rahim","Thank you. So let me start on the hiring question. So, I would first point out that we are starting to see momentum in hiring. We have now, over a hundred new sales reps compared to just a quarter ago. So the ramp is really starting, and it's just not as fast as what we would like. And probably, the biggest reason for that is it's a competitive environment out there in terms of attracting and recruiting talent.","But I think now with the energy and focus that we put on the problem, we will start to benefit from, being able to fill the open reps that are available. I also just want to point out that as important as hiring is getting our sales teams to full productivity as quickly as possible. And we have put in place, a really professional and robust enablement process at Juniper that\u2019s starting to work very effectively in our favor that will accelerate the time to productivity.","So, more work to do, but I'm pleased with the direction that we're taking now and the speed that we're moving ahead.","Ken Miller","Yes. And on the buyback front, I would just call out that we did $300 million in a Q2 ASR that just closed last quarter. In addition to that we did $50 million in Q3 at opportunistic purchases and we intend to enter into a $200 million, buy back soon. So that's $550 million this year, that plus our dividends is well over a 100% of our free cash flow. And I feel good about that. That said, we will continue to be opportunistic, right? We are announcing our intent to enter into a $200 million ASR. But we'll look to be opportunistic beyond that as we exit this year and into the next.","Ittai Kidron","Very good. Good luck guys.","Ken Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Silverstein","I appreciate you all taking the questions. First off, Ken I feel bad for you? I don't think you said too much on this call. So, from a margin perspective, you've gotten back, I think, close is not exactly to where you were before the PTX to MX transition. Any visibility as to how much better you can do without the benefit of meaningful revenue growth and with the benefit of more meaningful, relatively speaking more meaningful revenue growth before I have a follow-up.","Ken Miller","Yes, but don't feel bad, first of all, Paul. It's good to be here on the call. On a gross margin perspective, I would say, on a full year basis we're going to be about 60%. Right? So, although we had a strong Q3 and our guide for Q4 is also strong, full year base is about 60%. So we still have a ways to go to get to the high-end of our model of 58% to 62%. We're very focused on that over time. Volume will be the driver that said, so is product mix.","So, making sure that our software solutions continue to grow as they have been for the last several quarters is a big part of the long-term gross margin profile. I am continuing being too focused on cost per byte, and margin management, pricing management, et cetera. So there is a lot of initiatives underway to help the company get to the higher end of that range but volume is definitely a driving factor.","Paul Silverstein","All right. And Rami, a two part question here. One, how would you characterize the challenge in terms of the opportunity in breaking into the inch rod data center or leaf spine or perhaps core portion of web-scale relative to the risk of one of your competitors breaking into your bailey with your stronghold of wide area within that cloud customer base, what are the differences, what are the similarities, in terms of the risk relative to the opportunity? And the other question is if you would, can you give us any incremental insight on U.S. Enterprise and U.S. Service Provider in particular beyond the more general comments on the call, appreciate it.","Rami Rahim","Okay. Thanks for the questions Paul. So, first it's good to understand our footprint in the hyperscale networks. We\u2019re very strong in the wide area and core networks. We are reasonably strong when it comes to data center interconnect and then we have relatively little, if any share in hyperscale leaf spine. We've got good deployments in sort of the tier two, tier three cloud providers switching but in hyperscale switching as it pertains to at leaf spine, they are a very limited footprint.","If you look at where the initial opportunities are going to be for 400-gig, I expect them to be in the data center and in the data center interconnect where our penetration is not as strong as it is in the wide area and in the core market.","The second part of your question around sort of the ease of which there is share shift in any one of these different layers. I\u2019d point out that, share shift is always more difficult, but it is easier when there is inflection point and 400 gig is such an inflection point. And I would also argue that the software capabilities in DCI and in the data center, they're not small by any means, but they're no where near as sophisticated from a routing scale functionality features, of the true core wide area deployments.","So, I in no way want to make it sound like this is going to be an easy slam dunk. It's going to be an extremely competitive process. But I think we have the goods, the technology, the engagement model, the relationships that allow us to compete very effectively. And then I think the second question was around enterprise and SP as it pertains to the U.S. specifically.","Today the trends in both of those areas are largely the same worldwide. In the service provider space, the challenges that are being felt by tier one SPs as they gear up towards 5G deployments are roughly the same internationally or certainly where we have a strength in the U.S. in Western Europe in some parts of Asia Pacific as well. And then the enterprise, I would say the same thing, which is that both factors are at play in terms of the macro economic outlook and the impact of that on spending, as well as our sales transformation, which is really a worldwide sales transformation. So that I don't think there's anything specific to the U.S. in both cases.","Ken Miller","The only thing I would add is the U.S. Federal business is, is typically strong. In Q3 we had a very strong result in Q3. We typically see that go down in Q4 seasonally. That said, we do expect all up enterprise on a worldwide basis, to be up sequentially, despite the fact that U.S. Federal will likely be down.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Daryanani","Yes. Thanks for taking my question guys. Two for me. First up on the Enterprise softness side, maybe I missed this, but could you quantify the weakness that you guys saw towards the end of the quarter, either in terms of the change in bookings trajectory or how much revenues do you think you left on the table towards end of the quarter. And then do you think you can pick up at least half of that, which might be attributed to Juniper specific dynamics?","Rami Rahim","Yes, so on the Q3 results, from the revenue results, we actually didn't see the weakness, right? So there was nothing left on the table, if you will from a Q3 revenue perspective, the commentary is really more about guidance into Q4 and, we are off, $20 million to $40 million in total books, which is why we previously were in our Q4 guide. So, we're still guiding to modest growth, but it is down slightly from where we were before.","The both, that delta is really split between Enterprise and an SP weakness. So we're talking, $10 million to $20 million range of kind of softness.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. That's really helpful. And then that's helpful. Just follow-up with, when I think about calendar 2020 and the commentary around, flat to I think low single digit growth is what you guys have talked about? Can you just talk about what sort of trend line do you need the service provider business to be at for the overall company to have that kind of growth? Can you do this low single-digit growth, even if service providers are down mid-teens, or do you need a step-up there to achieve those overall calendar 2020 target?","Ken Miller","Yes, so for next year we are really not prepared to talk about specific guidance. I do think overall we have a lot of opportunity to grow across many verticals, cloud and enterprise in particular and service provider. Rami already mentioned, we think we have an opportunity to lessen the decline, if you will. But how it's going to actually shake out next year, it's a little too early to call out at this point.","I\u2019d just caution you to be got, I encourage you to be cautious just given some of the macro certainties the continued weakness. That's why I think flat to perhaps some slight growth next year is a good model at this point.","Rami Rahim","Operator, we'll take two more questions.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Erik Lapinski","Hi team. You have Erik on for James. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe just to touch on the share repurchases and the increased authorization today, can you maybe walk us through the decision process on moving forward with share repurchases versus maybe maintaining extra dry power for acquisitions and given the success of Mist and if anything was attractive in the space?","Ken Miller","Yes, it's a good question, Erik. I mean balance is very important. We clearly want to maintain our flexibility for future value enhancing M&A. At the same time, I think it's prudent to return capital to shareholders, particularly when we feel, it is an opportunistic time to do so. And that's kind of what we are now. We feel good about our prospects in the future and we still are going to maintain, well north of $2.5 billion, even post ASR, we\u2019ll grow cash in Q4 with cash flow from operations. So our cash balances remain very strong, as well, so that gives us opportunity to continue to be, as needed from an M&A front.","Erik Lapinski","Thanks. And then maybe if I could just sneak in a second one, as you were mentioning actions to mitigate tariffs and kind of maintain gross margins, could you just walk us through maybe some of the specific actions that you're doing there?","Ken Miller","Yes, well, the primary action is really just, the geographic footprint of where our products are produced. So we have products, we have plants in China as well as outside of China and Asia and other parts of North America. So, really it's about, shifting some of the supply chain, particularly that headed into the U.S. to some of our alternative supply plants and that's what we've been doing over the last several quarters.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","George Notter","Hi. Thanks a lot guys. I guess I'm curious about your views on the cost structure of the company. I'm thinking about it from an OpEx perspective. If I look back, you've got two years of year-on-year top line declines. The OpEx run rates are still clipping along at $480 million, $490 million a quarter, about the same as even two years ago. So, I guess I'm just curious about your thoughts on an opportunity for cost reductions here or is there something about the business now that makes it more R&D intensive or sales and marketing intensive, any thoughts that would be great. Thanks.","Ken Miller","Yes, so I actually feel pretty good about our ability to control costs. We've been flat to slightly down over the last couple of years, this would be the second year we're actually on a full year basis, we\u2019ll be slightly down. Clearly that's in the headwinds of cost of living and et cetera. That said, I do think that we are quite honestly, we're optimized where we are. I don't see us going deeper. We've been pretty committed that when we don't grow revenue, we're not going to grow OpEx. But I do think, we've done the low hanging fruit over the last several years on cost controls and OpEx. Take out, if you will, at this point, it requires investment for us to grow and that's what we're focused on.","So, going forward, you could expect us to remain prudent, when revenue is challenged we will not be investing much in OpEx, but we want to continue with these investment levels to take advantage of the opportunities we have ahead of us to grow.","Rami Rahim","I would just add that, whereas we have been really careful and prudent in how we invest across the board, including R&D, where we have been investing in technologies like 400 gigs, silicon-photonics or our cloud delivered enterprise, which includes our Mist portfolio, our data center technology, I believe are the right areas for us to invest in, in order to achieve long-term growth for this company. So for that reason, I do think that these investments are truly going to payoff for us.","George Notter","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Rami Rahim","Thank you everyone for your questions. We look forward to speaking and meeting with you during the quarter. That concludes today's call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

And welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may now begin.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, Operator. And thanks for joining us today to discuss Juniper Networks second quarter financial results and outlook for the third quarter of 2015 which we announced earlier this afternoon.","With me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, capital return program, and overall future prospects.","Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release, and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time to time.","All statements made during this call are made only as of today.

Full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome everybody. We delivered a solid second quarter for 2015. Revenue was stronger than the outlook we provided partially as a result of recognition of differed revenue but also as a result of an overall improvement in demand across several of our key customer verticals.","I am particularly pleased with the broad diversity of both bookings and revenue in the quarter. Strong operating margin and EPS reflect our ongoing focus on execution and our disciplined approach to managing our expenses while we invest in the future of the company. I am proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished while at the same time mindful that there is still more we can do to achieve our company's full potential.","This quarter we unveiled several new products and innovative new addition to the QFX5100 product family of datacenter switching that converges compute resources, and customizable logic into the network. And ultracompact three terabits per second core router the PTX 1000 that achieves unprecedented levels of power efficiency and performance.","And we also introduced enhancements to the SRX which make it the industry's fastest firewall that will enable our customers to secure their cloud network without slowing them down. Our priority now is on execution as we expect to begin the first shipments of these new products in the near future.","We are investing a next generation IP networking and solutions in ways that help our customers perceive business transformations with profound effects on the cost efficiencies and time to market. By engaging with our customers directly at the engineer-to-engineer level, we've collaborated on solutions that produce the ultimate in agility and automation.","Building these relationships has resulted in some exciting new customers this quarter, including some great technology innovators in Silicon Valley. One of which is a fast-growing global transportation network company.","We're also pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing with our cloud services customers. It's truly an honor that so many technology pioneers continue to look to Juniper to enable them to build the advanced IP networks that their businesses depend on. I know how proud all of us at Juniper are about this.","Let me summarize some highlights this quarter across the routing, switching and security components of our business. While we are excited about the new products we announced this year, this quarter's results reflect strong performance of our current routing portfolio and particularly a record quarter for both the PTX and MX series.","In Q2 momentum with the PTX accelerated as customers continue to embrace the architectural thesis behind this product line, which radically increases transport efficiency in any IP wide area network. We have been at the forefront of driving this vision for efficient high performance IP transport.","With the MX customers began adopting our recently introduced line card contributing to exceptionally strong MX revenue this quarter. We also secured early orders for all our recently announced edge products, including the ACX5000 and the virtual MX.","We are building on the clear success of our edge routing platform across all verticals and leveraging our worldwide market footprint to drive the architectural transition towards virtualization and programmability. We believe our compelling routing solutions with our ongoing execution will continue to drive growth and enable us to take market share.","As an example, we had our first revenue customers of the virtual MX in Q2, and furthermore our Northstar WAN SDN controller is in beta trials and is receiving positive field reception. Our Contrail solution has moved into production deployment and is fast becoming the option of choice for OpenStack environments.","In switching, we also had a record quarter for the QFX series. We saw good momentum in the data center with broad based strength in the enterprise, as well as growth for cloud providers and carriers.","Customers value our switching innovation in the data center, because it helps them stay ahead of their need for scale and performance, while also providing rich Layer 3 capability, deep network visibility and automation.","We expect that our high leverage R&D strategy will allow us to easily bring the innovation to our EX product family over the next year for a mission-critical enterprise campus and branch network.","In security, I'm pleased with our revenue growth of 15% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, excluding Junos Pulse. Specifically these results were driven by growth in the high end and branch SRX products in cloud data center, mobile carrier and enterprise customer segments.","Having said that, there is still a lot of hard work for us to stabilize this element of our business. I continue to expect 2016 to be the year of growth for us in security, and I expect it to be a bit bumpy as we get there.","Juniper's integrated network security strategy enables us to be a strong provider of secure network, and we remain confident we can win. However, it will take us time as I stated.","We continue to see industries trends unfolding largely as we expected. There is no shortage of demand for network innovation as more and more organizations are turning to the cloud to transform their business and as network traffic growth remains healthy.","Our results speak to the fact that our strategy is resonating with our customers, and we will continue to deliver on our vision to be the worldwide leader in network innovation.","In closing, we remain steadfast in our commitment to drive profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. We continue to execute with a sense of urgency and a disciplined approach to how we manage the business.","I am thankful for our customers, partners and stockholders who share our vision and for our outstanding employees who work hardest to help us achieve our success.","Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to share her thoughts on the quarter.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Similar to last quarter, we posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call.","For the second quarter of 2015 we delivered strong financial results which reflected strength in our underlying business and the focused execution to our strategy. Our results succeed in both our revenue and earnings expectations for the quarter with solid sequential growth across routing, switching and security.","The following factors contributed to the revenue outperformance this quarter. Revenue recognized from product deferred revenue, the majority of which was due to the delivery of product and feature commitments and a sell-through of channel inventory.","Demand was also better than we anticipated in the following areas, cloud and cable providers, enterprise and to a lesser extent a sequential improvement from regional carriers in the Americas.","The improved demand was also reflected in security, which had a growth quarter primarily due to the timing of high end SRX deployments. The underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than one.","Product backlog increased sequentially and significantly year-over-year. As I mentioned the sequential decline of approximately 19% in product deferred revenue positively contributed to our results this quarter.","Our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective cost management and a significant reduction in our share count enabled us to deliver strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion.","In the quarter we completed $600 million of share repurchases. Since Q1 of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders, against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.","Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q3 and the demand environment in the second half of 2015. Industry trends continue to unfold largely as we expected. There is obviously some uncertainty around the macro environment, conditions in China and certain parts of Europe.","We have factored into our outlook continued weakness in China and ongoing softness in the relative exchange rate of the euro. Consistent with our view last quarter we anticipate an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, and this is based on the following assumption.","We expect continued diversification of our revenue with cloud and cable customers and improved demand from large US carriers. We also expect continued improvement in the enterprise market along with growth from some of our international customers as they continue to build out their networks.","You can find the detailed outlook for Q3 in the CFO commentary available on our website.","In summary, I'm pleased with our strong performance in Q2, and I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.","I now, I would like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yes. Hi, guys. And thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter as well. So I wanted to start off I guess by asking you about the deferred revenue a little bit and see if you guys could dig into that in just a little more detail, maybe give us some idea of what product categories the deferred revenue was released on.","As well as I guess Robyn in the guidance, could you talk a little bit about do you expect another release of deferred revenue next quarter or is that more organic revenue growth that you're guiding for? And I've got a follow-up.","Robyn Denholm","Thanks, Rod. I'll answer that question and if Rami has anything to add I'm sure he'll chime in. On the deferred revenue as you know on the balance sheet we have services in product deferred revenue.","Our product deferred revenue quarter-over-quarter was down about $48 million. Some of which obviously we were expecting and anticipated in the guidance, and some of which we didn't. So I wanted to call out the fact that we did see some upside in terms of the quarter\u2019s absolute results that came off the balance sheet.","Having said that, we are very, very pleased with the underlying demand and so as you can see our demand metrics are very healthy for the quarter, both in terms of product book-to-bill, but also in terms of the overall strength across the routing, switching and security areas and in the fact that the backlog is up significantly year-over-year.","So primarily the product deferred revenue in terms of guidance for Q3, obviously we always have projects that we are delivering and new projects that come on to the balance sheet, as well as future features that we're delivering through our software releases. And so for Q3 we don't expect a material change in terms of any further recognition.","The other thing that I wanted to point out, in Q2 part of the reduction in product deferred revenue was associated with the channel. So as you know we record revenue on a sell-through basis.","In terms of the channel inventory at the end of the quarter it was actually quite healthy demand in the enterprise space which we talked about, which actually resulted in some of the deferred revenue reduction in the quarter.","Rod Hall","Okay. Thanks, Robyn. And I - just my follow up. Well, okay. Can I have a follow up or no?","Robyn Denholm","Switch over to next question.","Rod Hall","Okay.","Kathleen Nemeth","No, no. Let's go to next question, and we'll circle back if we have time. Thanks, Rod. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski","Hi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask you in terms of just the \u2013 performance for the company, now this is the third quarter, would it been raised and that's before you've had the Tier 1 carriers kicking in, in terms of the anticipated improvement in the second half, and also before you test some of the recent product launches kick in as well.","So I just wanted to understand a little bit how much of this is a function of the end demand environment versus your own execution versus any other factors you might point to?","Rami Rahim","Okay. Great. Thanks for the question Simona. I'll start and I'll see if Robyn has anything to add. Obviously we were pleased with the results in Q2 and I think there are a couple of underlying themes that are indicative of what we saw.","First and foremost is the continued diversity in our business across a number of key verticals that have offset continued weakness in the telcos space. So cloud, cable were kite strong for us in Q2, but we're also seeing good business in terms of large enterprises and some of these, we call a high-tech companies in the Valley and elsewhere.","The other thing that we saw happening in Q2 is just around the diversification across product lines. We saw sequential growth, healthy sequential growth across switching, routing and security. So all of that helped offset some of the cyclicality that would exist in the business.","And your question around the second half is essentially largely playing out as we have been articulating over the last several quarters, where we expect to see some improvement in telco, but we have not been waiting for that improvement to come ideally.","We have been in a mode of actively focusing on making sure that we have the products and the go to market focus to continue to diversify the business and that's what's helping \u2013 and I expect that to continue to help into the second half.","As you get even beyond the second half, you know you mentioned the new products. We remain extremely excited about the new products that we announced in the Q1 timeframe. But those are not going to be significant contributors to revenue this year. Those really start to contribute next year. And that's yet another way that we help offset some of the cyclicality that exist in the business.","Robyn Denholm","Yes. Just to add and Rami said it very well. We are pleased with the results in the quarter. We are also pleased with the previous two quarters as you mentioned. But we're not confused. We are still down year-to-date on a revenue basis year-over-year and there is still a lot of work to do.","So the team is focused on doing that, they are delivering. The execution is very good from the team across the board and I've seen Rami talked about some of the underlying trends that we're executing towards. So I think overall we're pleased with the health of the business.","Simona Jankowski","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani","Hi, guys. Two questions. First is about the operating margin. 25% this quarter, 25.2% very high, what's the target, what's the next target and how do you think about it next year, how much upside?","And again if you cannot give a quantitative guidance, maybe you can just speak about the puts and takes in what drives it up, what drives it down, so we know how to better model this.","Second question is about the strength this quarter. Again, it's a question that I can ask on a quantitative way or qualitative. And the question is how much of the growth is pent-up demand, meaning customers are waiting for new product for a while and there is concentrated orders in one quarter, two quarters et cetera and after that it normalizes down.","And how much of it is more about you finally having something and then the opportunities are wide and big and it opens up new market et cetera? So I'm trying to understand the sustainability of what we are seeing this quarter? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Okay. Hey, Tal. This is Rami. So let me start and then I will pass it over to Robyn. On the operating margin, we remain committed to our long-term model that we expressed to you guys in October of last year, which is 25% in a 3 year timeframe.","Yes, we hit 25% in the Q2 time frame. I don't expect it to be consistently that in - throughout the 3 year period. It might ebb and flow a little bit as it gets there, but 25% in a 3 year timeframe remains our long-term model.","In terms of the question around the strength of the business, pent-up demand. There isn't really anything that would suggest it was pent-up demand that all got released on a new product or a new market opportunity. In fact, what we saw as we mentioned in our prepared remarks was strength across a number of our key product lines, the MX the PTX the QFX all of which had record products.","We've been investing and innovating in all three product lines. We've been consistently introducing new line cards, new features and new capabilities. We've been winning new business with them throughout all of last year and the last couple quarters of this year. And what you're seeing now is the - that execution playing out in terms of strength.","So I don't think there is a sort of pent-up demand element that we're seeing right now, that resulted in the strength in Q2. It's just solid execution on the part of the Juniper team.","Robyn Denholm","Yes. I'll just add on the operating margin comment. We are pleased with hitting 25.2% in the quarter. Our view is that it shows the strength of the model. We've been very disciplined on the cost side as Rami indicated. We've obviously taken out structural costs over the last year. We're investing in the right product areas and the team is continuing to do that.","But we're also demonstrating that there's a lot of leverage in this model. If we get some upside in the revenue or some good growth in the revenue and we are up year-over-year, if you exclude the Junos Pulse acquisition from the Q2 results of last year, albeit modestly up and a lot of that dropped to the bottom line.","The other part of that which I'm sure you've noticed is that we are headed towards our 39% of revenue from an OpEx perspective, which again as Rami mentioned we're committed to doing, and we made very good progress for that this year.","So there's a long way to go before we hit what we stated last year in terms of the overall business model, but we're pleased with the progress.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks, Tal. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Rami you mentioned PTX a few times in the call today. I was just curious is this incremental demand from existing customers, are you seeing your footprint significantly expand? Maybe you should give us some clarity on the demand drivers.","And then Robyn, just quickly on OpEx, should we now expect OpEx at the upper end of your $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million for this year.","Rami Rahim","Okay. Thanks, Amitabh. So on the PTX question, I think that it's both. Its what we're seeing is business where we had already been deployed now expanding with some of the newer line cards and capabilities we've introduced into that product line.","We're also seeing new or use cases across different verticals, so I will say for example the PTX because of its power efficiency and just the sheer scale has started to become adopted by the cloud provider customers. They love that sort of technology and transport efficiency in that product line. And I continue to believe that it will strengthen over time.","Keep in mind that we're about to introduce pretty incredible enhancements to it. The announcements that we announced in the Q1 timeframe, that triple the performance and reduce the power even further. And there is a certain segment of our customers that just love that type of capability. And I'll pass it on to Robyn for the OpEx question.","Robyn Denholm","Thanks, Rami. So on the OpEx side, as I mentioned in response to the last question about the operating margin. We are very committed to prudent cost management over the future, as we've demonstrated over the last year.","Our long-term model is to grow OpEx well within revenue and we've done - we've obviously been taking out OpEx at a faster rate than our revenue declines over the last period of time.","We are below the last few quarters in terms of the percentage of revenue. We've been above 40% in Q1 in the back half of last year in terms of OpEx as a percentage of revenue and we're headed toward the area that we outlined in October of last year of 39%.","So our view is that the business is strong and healthy as we mentioned before. We put out the $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million at this time last year and we've executed to that very, very well. As we move forward, as we start to see revenue growth, then we expect to be towards that 39% of revenue in terms of OpEx.","And so you could say there are certain scenarios where you could see us be slightly above the 19, 25 [ph] but it would be as a result of revenue factors and that would be on variable comp, as opposed to investing more dollars. It would be around that variable nature of the cost that we've been speaking about for some time.","Rami Rahim","Let me just emphasize that point. If in fact we do see that we start to get to the top end of our OpEx range or even beyond that it, it will not be because we will take our eye off the ball in terms of OpEx management, it will only because \u2013 it will be because of the variable comp element that's tied to revenue.","And at that point, I would just say that the focus should anyways tilt towards profitability and specifically OpEx as a percentage of revenue, which this quarter or in Q2 was below 40%.","Amitabh Passi","Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks, Amitabh. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mark Sue of RBC. Please go ahead.","Mark Sue","Thank you. Are we now at the point where we're making significant investment of this is the portfolio, how should we think about the switching side, continued investments there and how should we also think about security.","We're seeing a balance after many quarters of declines, and particularly if you can give us a sense of how customers are resonating with a combined solution for both switching and tying that with security, what landscape that continues to live up that would be helpful?. Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Sure. Thanks for the question Mark. On the switching side I'm really pleased with the progress that the team has made. From a go-to market standpoint, we continue to see more traction, both in terms of service providers in the enterprise side. I have said in the past that we have been competing in this space without a complete portfolio that includes our spine switches and that has limited the total addressable market opportunity for us.","That's largely now being addressed this year with a new series of QFX spine switches that we will start to introduce. So that I think is going to help us maintain and improve the momentum over time.","Now it takes time for our customers to evaluate test - fully test and certify these new spine switches. But so far the early feedback from our customers is very positive","And your question around the portfolio itself that includes switching, routing and securities is actually a very good one, it is in fact a muscle that we're building in the organization and a clear strategy of ours to talk to our customers around cloud architecture as opposed to just switching in a silo.","We're doing all of our training around that and it's resonating with our customers, and we've seen, especially in terms of security, there is this incredible opportunity to leverage insights that comes from switching and routing in the cloud that can help your overall security posture and also leverage your switching and routing in the cloud to install policies that can prevent the tax from spreading if and when they actually occur.","So that portfolio sale is very much part of our strategy and all the sings are that it's actually working quite effectively.","Kathleen Nemeth","Great. Thanks Mark. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you, the next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Jess Lubert","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question congratulations on a strong quarter. My question is also for Rami, and I also wanted to dig into the portfolio cell, and specifically this is the first quarter in a long time where we're seeing switching, routing and security, all see very strong sequential results in the same quarter.","So, I was hoping you could help us understand to what degree this is due to an uptick in customers buying a portfolio of your products and perhaps you can help us understand the pipeline you're seeing of large multi product deals, the sales efforts here and to what extent you're seeing a competitive advantage from taking a multi product base selling approach?","A \u2013 Rami Rahim","Right, I think it's still early days and there is still a lot more potential for us if you will, of leveraging portfolio selling to actually improve the overall results across all the different product line.","So that exists today, it existed in the past but what we're doing right now is we're essentially doubling down on the marketing, the collateral, the sales training that will actually in fact help us make this the key differentiator for us.","The other thing that we're doing is we're implementing features. So for example, some of the tie in between security, and switching, routing I just mentioned in the answer to the previous question, requires certain capabilities that you actually build into these product lines.","There are definitely -- I don't know the exact percentages that I can answer your question with, but there are definitely large opportunities that we have won both in the enterprise and in the service provider, but where it has been portfolio that some combinations of our products.","In Q2, strength in switching and in routing is anticipated, I think the momentum there is solid because of the strength of our portfolio in each of those segment. In security, we still have more work to do. There is -- we saw a good quarter I think because of the fact that we had great opportunities and revenue in both enterprise and SP, but I think there could be a little bit of a bumpy ride as I mentioned in my prepared remarks before we get to sustained growth in 2016.","Q \u2013 Jess Lubert","Thanks guys.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks Jess.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Brian White","Yeah, Rami, I'm wondering if you could just update us on what you're seeing right now in terms of appetite for NFE and SDN solutions here, and how you're thinking about it going into the next year? Thanks.","A \u2013 Rami Rahim","Sure Brian, it's definitely part of pretty much every strategic discussion that we have with any one of our -- especially service provider customers, in some cases also in the enterprise base, but mostly on the service provider side.","Right now it's very much an architectural discussion of what's needs to evolve within the service provider network locations, what we call central offices or PoPs as to set their infrastructure up in order to be capable of delivering next generation services using NFV.","For us what it means is, first you need to develop great VNS, virtual network function. It's our software services that will be delivered off the cloud, and we're doing just that. So we just recognized our first revenue in the virtual MX in the Q2 time frame, and the virtual SRX is also a really great example of taking what is a physical product and take and using or leveraging all of the great functionality but repurposing to virtual machines sitting on generic server.","Those VNS and that architecture, that's only part of the problem. In order to really package the solution together you need to have automation and orchestration and the management to help our customers actually deliver these services with agility and with ease to their end users.","And this where product like Contrail comes in, and most service providers that we're seeing are gravitating toward an OpenStack based orchestration solution, our goal for Contrail is simple, to make it the best networking stack for OpenStack.","And I have to say that the data we're getting directly from our customers but also through surveys. for example, that were conducted at the OpenStack forum just a few weeks ago suggest that we are heading in the right direction in terms of achieving that goal.","So it's still early days in summer, but I feel very good about the discussions we're having, the products we're building, the way that we're executing, and the go to market attention we have in terms of just making sure that we emerge as true winners in this space.","Brian White","That was good, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, the next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Sanjiv Wadhwani","Thanks, just one clarification and then a question. On the clarification, Robyn remind us if you've disclosed exposure to the cloud vertical as to percentage of revenues coming from there.","And then Rami, a question for you, wondering how much of the underlying demand in the telco vertical, whether it's happened or it's coming is from 10 to 100 gig upgrades, and if that's happening, where we are in that cycle, in that upgrade cycle? Thanks.","Robyn Denholm","So, thanks Sanjiv. In terms of the percentage of revenue, we haven't put out the overall mix in terms of percentage of revenue since Q3 of last year. We will look to possibly do that in the next period of time.","Having said that, what I will share with you, like I did last quarter is the number of customers and our top 10 customers in the quarter. So for Q2, our top 10 customers, four were telco, two were in the U.S. and two were not in the U.S. Five were cloud and cable customers, and one was the large enterprise customer. And so if you recall last quarter, there was one more telco customer and one less cloud and cable customer in the top 10.","What I will also say is you know this underlying same as diversification is absolutely real in terms of that number of customers that we have in each one of the areas that we're talking about, both in terms of telco, not only U.S. but also international.","The regional carriers as I mentioned in my prepared remarks today or in my commentary, were actually good for us in the U.S. in the second quarter. And so the diversification is they are across all of the different verticals as well as within the vertical how many customers we're serving, and then also the third element of geographic diversification.","A \u2013 Rami Rahim","And Sanjiv, on your question around 10 to 100 gig migration and that helping with momentum in the telco space. I think that has actually, largely started in certain network layers of the service provider space a while back in the wide area network, and the metro networks and we certainly benefited from that to some extent. ","But beyond that, I think it will continue and it will move into different use cases and applications. Cloud providers for example, loved the fact that our security portfolio, the high end SRX actually supports 100 gig interfaces to connect their clouds to the wide area network and when it comes to 100 gig interfaces on a firewall, that we're the only game in town. Really, so that's the use cases have actually became a very good use case for us.","And then certainly there is a migration that's happening in the core of the datacenter as well that we are taking advantage of. I don't think that there was any sort of a step function change anytime recently. I think this is an ongoing transformation that's happening across the SP space and the cloud space and the cable space that we'll continue to take advantage of.","Sanjiv Wadhwani","Got it, thank you, helpful.","Robyn Denholm","Thanks Sanjiv.","Operator","Thank you, the next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James Faucette","Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask two questions, first Rami, I think you've mentioned a couple of times that or always that there were record product revenues at least in some of the product families. Just if you could elaborate and clarify that, and then Robyn, you may have mentioned this but I apologize if I missed it, but just wondering if you could give a little insight as to what's happening in Asia and kind of the reason that geography seemed under perform a little bit some of the others and how you're thinking about that going into the second half of the year, I think you've said you tried to model that conservatively but just a little bit more color there would be helpful thank you?","A \u2013 Rami Rahim","Okay, thanks James. Let me start on the record product question and then I'll pass it over to Robyn to comment on the Asia question. Yes, so we did say and that is a fact that three of our product lines our flagship product, The MX, the PTX, QFX, all has record revenue quarters in the Q2 time frame","Robyn Denholm","[indiscernible] services by the way.","A \u2013 Rami Rahim","Thanks for the reminder, and each for a different reason. The MX has always been a very successful product, and we continue to invest in that platform to keep ahead of the demand for capacity, but also the demand for services.","The thesis pieces behind the MX was all around conversions, is around simplifying your edge architecture by deploying a single platform that can deliver all services. I think we were pioneers in articulating that thesis and executing that strategy, and we've benefited from that, and we've introduced new line in card, new capabilities to actually make this more of a reality and we certainly saw the results in Q2.","PTX, this is a product line that we knew when we initially shipped it would require a bit of a different mindset around how to develop and build out a next generation core architecture, we called it the super core.","And this requires a bit of a different approach to how one might in fact architect a wide area core, or a wide are metro network. And quite frankly it took us a bit a time, took us some time to make sure our customers were educated on the transformation that's required but also on the benefit that they could reap from this architecture, and I'm very happy that we're seeing sort of that transition happened and we are starting to see faster growth from the PTX, that proves that the pieces that we had made initially was the right one.","QFX, this is -- first again, we continue to add new capabilities to our QFX topper bracts, which is in our access switches, but we're also just from a go to market stand point, been focusing quite heavily on our datacenter opportunities, our cloud opportunities, and that's where the growth in the market is and that's where the differentiation that we have in the QFX in terms of things like the layer 3 capabilities, really start to become very effective and the results are that we saw a great quarter for the QFX.","Robyn Denholm","So, let me talk about APAC, and Rami can chime in as. So APAC, we did have a disappointing quarter there. The revenues were down 10% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter.","We were anticipating a softness in China. And in my outlook I mentioned that I expect that to continue. Some of it is obviously geopolitical and also competitive factors in China. If we excluded China, actually the revenues would have been up for the rest of the APAC, 11% sequentially.","So, we've talked previously about -- obviously about different regions within Asia Pacific, we're seeing good design wins and growth in the Asian countries, Malaysia, and Singapore, obviously Indonesia, we have seen some good wins in India. Although that market, we're continuing to increase our capabilities in.","In terms of the New Zealand operations in Q2, had a good quarter. Japan was slightly soft but actually not bad overall and the -- Korea was slightly negative as well. But 10 to go more inline with service providers deployment just given the concentration that we have in those market around service provider.","So our view is, in terms of the region we're making progress in a lot of different areas. China was weak in the quarter and we expected to be weak as we move forward.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay. Thanks, James. Next question?","Operator","Yes. The next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Ittai Kidron","Thanks. And congrats on a good quarter. I had a couple questions for you Robyn. First on the deferred revenue, again going back to that. I understand that revenue came off the deferred into the revenue. But why is it that you\u2019re long-term deferred is the one part that\u2019s actually been declining on a year-over-year basis for three quarters in a row into high teens, what does that mean, what's going on there.","And the second question goes back to the question Tal asked before, you've effectively touched on your long-term target right now, are you now at a mode where you are hiring, you are net hiring on a year-over-year basis.","Do you feel that you've been running a little bit too hot, meaning the revenue relative to the employee base that you have that you need to ramp. I understand that your long-term you wanted to clearly drive revenue faster than OpEx. But is there a three fourth quarter period where is there a little bit of a catch-up, if you've gone a little bit too far maybe?","Robyn Denholm","So let me talk about deferred revenue. So, long-term deferred revenue is primarily services. So we do service contract renewals on a one year and a three year basis. And depending on the customer, depending on whether they a renew on a one year or three-year basis.","And so the declines that you've seen are in the long-term are specifically to do with the proportion of three year versus one year at any point in time. So obviously three year customers it will come down before they renew again for three years. And so that's what you've been seeing fleet off on the long-term. There isn't anything more than that in the long-term deferred revenue. And so when those renew you will see that long-term actually increase again.","In terms of hiring, I put the headcount numbers in my actual commentary. So we ended this quarter at 8,815 head [ph] modestly up from the prior quarter. The team is being very focused on how we actually continue to invest in the things that matter, around the product portfolio and that type of thing.","I'm not expecting a catch-up in terms of headcount or significant increase in headcount. We're managing things very well and quite honestly the teams are very productive, the way we are.","Rami Rahim","Yes. The only thing I'll add is, we have what we need in the plan that we're working towards this year to invest in all the areas of innovation that we know we need to invest in for the - our long-term competitiveness in the spaces that we're in.","Robyn Denholm","Yes. That was something very conscious that we did \u2013 at this time of taking out the structural cost.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay. Thanks, Ittai.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder Garcha","Thanks. Maybe a question for Rami. By basic question is, given all the products and the success you are seeing across various different verticals. Do you think by the end of this year that Juniper will be in a stage where will be sufficiently diversified you wouldn't have years of touch on longer periods of revenue declines, you would have diversify, especially away from service provider cycle or that require a little bit longer of trying to understand the timing of it? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Thanks for the question, Kulbinder. I think this - the strategy that we're on and the focus across the key vertical segments, cloud, cable, telco's, financial services, government, is one that I think has a lot of list. I mean, the opportunity for us in cable for example or in cloud appears to be very good and sustainable.","I know for example, let me just tick on one vertical in the cloud space where we are very, very close to them in terms of the architectural evolution of their network today, but also in the future and also in terms of the capabilities, the features, the performance, the scalability that we are implementing into our new products that will be released over the coming year and beyond.","It's just a function of our strategy and I think that it's something that can actually play out for a long period of time. Very difficult to put a time period on it, but it is not something that I see as an immediate or short term end to.","Kulbinder Garcha","Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay, great. Thanks, Kulbinder. We'll go to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes, thanks. Yes, congratulations Rami to new team, solid results. Quick question if I may, is on the Web 2.0 cloud customer segment, more recently we have been hearing Arista and perhaps Cisco starting to leverage new merchant silicon for routing, in particular data center routing which could soon scale up into the core telco network?","So like to get your understanding of the competitive dynamics that you see from your point of view from a pricing point of view mainly and also from a feature performance point of view competing with these news merchant silicon Layer 3 switch routers versus what you have currently in your portfolio with MX and PTX? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Sure, Vijay. So clearly \u2013 first let me just say this. We use both merchant and also our own silicon across the variety of products in switching and routing and in security. We are absolutely not going to be religious about using our own or somebody else's. We're going to choose the best silicon and to solve the problem in the most effective and differentiated way possible.","And before we embark on a new silicon project ourselves at Juniper, we go through very extensive analysis to make sure that it is in fact something that\u2019s going to differentiate us and therefore pay off because these chip projects as you know are not inexpensive projects, and we've done exactly that.","If you look at the cloud space for example, the access layer where it really comes down to pricing not that much differentiation in certain market segments. You can easily go to commodity.","As you get into the core the need for power efficiency programmability, the need for logical scale, IP routing capabilities becomes greater. And so the opportunity to differentiate with your own silicon becomes evident or becomes theirs. And so that's what we've - essentially what we have done.","In the competitive environment, we understand. I mean, this is a competitive space and both from the standpoint of systems vendors that are using merchant or their own silicon and also from the standpoint of merchant silicon technology that's out there.","And as long as we are innovating and focusing on the parts of the market where we know that we can achieve differentiation then that's what we will do, we'll choose the best tools and technologies for the right areas of the network.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay. Thanks, Vijay. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Subu Subramanian of Hinduja Group [ph]. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Rami, my question was around visibility around the Tier1 carrier improvement that you've been mentioning and expecting for second half. Obviously September quarter guidance is a little bit more flat quarter-over-quarter, are you expecting towards fourth quarter more normal seasonality and is that when we should start seeing the US Tier 1 carriers improved. Could you talk about the outlook for the US Tier 1 carriers?","Robyn Denholm","Subu, let me just make sure I correct something that I hope people understand that the guidance for Q3 and then I'll hand it over to Rami on the visibility question. So you mentioned the word flat Q3 to Q2. Actually it's up.","So the way I want you to think about it is, if you take out of Q2 results, the deferred revenue impact it's on all of the $48 million, a large portion of that and then you actually look at that versus the guidance.","What you'll see is that we are actually projecting an increase quarter-over-quarter in the underlying business. More consistent actually with what we've seen historically when we've had growth years in terms of Q3 over Q2.","So with that I'll hand it to Rami to talk about the visibility.","Rami Rahim","Sure. First, I just want to emphasize the fact that, while the telco space remains a very important vertical for us, we are by no means tied completely to that space in terms of what drives our business. The diversification across the vertical and across products is certainly helping us in dampening if you will some of the effects of the lumpiness in that space.","As far as the second half, it really is consistent with what we have been saying over the last several quarters. We expect to see some improvement, but that's going to be complemented with continued diversity. That's going to help us achieve the results that we're expecting for the second half.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you. I think we have time for maybe one or two more questions. So next question operator?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks. I appreciate you taking my question. First off just housekeeping, were there any 10% customers? Secondly, if you already said it, I apologize, but what was the \u2013 what pricing environment are seeing both on the service, prior to routing side, as well in enterprise switching. And then question I have listened and I've heard your comments here in terms of the diversification of the business.","But I'm just wondering to what extent is the strength you are seeing now in you expect in the future, to what extent is that project driven and competitive dynamics, were you having greater success with the new platforms et cetera?","And to what extent are you seeing an improvement in demand. Obviously there is been quite a number of data points about enterprise weakness from others throughout the IT spectrum. And again I'm wondering to what extent is this in demand versus the project? Thank you.","Robyn Denholm","Okay. Paul, I'll handle the first couple of questions and then Rami can chime in. So in terms of 10% customers there weren't no 10% customers in the quarter. What was the second question\u2026","Rami Rahim","Pricing.","Robyn Denholm","Pricing. So in terms of the pricing environment, obviously it's a consistently competitive environment globally. But as you saw from the gross margins we had pretty healthy product gross margins, which reflects not only the ongoing competitiveness of the portfolio, but also the cost reductions that we continue to focus on in the supply chain. So from our perspective no discernible difference in the competitive dynamics in the quarter.","Rami Rahim","On the question around market versus projects and I am assuming you are really asking about whether something specific to Juniper in the projects we're engaging and versus something that's more broader. It really depends and in some cases it\u2019s very difficult for us to tell really.","But in the cloud space for example in our switching, what you are seeing there is more of the market opportunity shifting towards the data center. So we ourselves as a company are diverting more of our intentions, especially on the go to market side, on the support side to that opportunity and benefiting from the growth in that market segment.","I think in other verticals, like maybe in the cloud space it actually could be more project driven. It could be more of a market share phenomenon that's happening because we have traditionally been really strong and very close to that vertical and something that's paying off for us. So it's a mix and difficult to really break out in any precise detail.","Robyn Denholm","And Paul, I just want to make sure the telco customers are important customers to us as well. We're not saying that we are diversifying away from the customers. They are important. They will continue to be important.","Having said that, the innovation that we're delivering is as relevant to other parts of the market and through the changes that Rami mentioned in terms of not just the portfolio, but also the go to market notion. We're actually driving revenue growth through those other verticals as well. So I think that's a very important point.","And I think earlier in the questions there was the comment around cyclicality. There's no question one of the reasons why we decided to work on the go to market muscle in terms of some of these other verticals was exactly to that reason to offset some of that cyclicality as we move forward.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks, Paul. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Jeff Kvaal","Fantastic. Great.","Robyn Denholm","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Kvaal","Hi, everyone. Thank you. I think one of the things that you folks have hit on in some of your commentary about the routing market is the blurring of the line between the core and the edge.","Can you help us understand in a little bit more detail about what that means for you, I think at a high level one might say okay great, you can use your strengths in the quarter to improve your share in the edge. But then conversely one might wonder if Alcatel [ph] act, which has some presence in the edge may have a broader addressable market for them for example?","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks for the question Jeff. I guess the diversity what it means or sorry the blurring what it means for us is that when we go and develop our products we develop them in such a way that we becomes somewhat agnostic as to where in fact they will be placed to deal with the massive amount of IP transport traffic.","In some areas in might be in more of a nationwide or even a global network, in some areas it might be more of a metro network. What's happening today architecturally is data centers in some cases are being built in more distributed locations, which puts more pressure in the metro areas and in some cases then more central locations that will put more pressure in the core areas. If we build the products that will deal with either architectural case then we win either way and that's exactly the goal.","So take for example our PTX product line. It comes in a large and medium and now with the PTX1000 a small form factor and that's a perfect example of how we are building these products and the capabilities of these products to address interest the issue of scale or the challenge of scale, irrespective the architecture that the customer ultimately wants to sell.","It makes more difficult for us to break out, our numbers into core and edge we can sort of estimate it. But I sort of tend to measure ourselves now as more as routing all up in the wide area network as opposed to specific to core edge.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay. Would that be misstating to you to say it becomes easier for you to sell the architectural play and therefore you think it's an advantage relative to some people who traditionally have been stronger just in one or the other?","Rami Rahim","I would agree with that. Yes.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay. All right. Okay, good. Thank you all very much.","Rami Rahim","Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks, Jeff. Thank you everyone. This will conclude our call for today. Thank you as always for your great questions. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation."],"12517":["Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) Q3 2014 Earnings Call October 23, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Kathleen Nemeth - ","Shaygan Kheradpir - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Robyn M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Here on the call are Shaygan Kheradpir, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer. Vince Molinaro, Executive Vice President, Chief Customer Officer; and Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Juniper Development and Innovation, will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, overall future prospects, planned operating, expensed reductions and capital allocation plans are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including: economic conditions generally or within the networking industry, changes in the overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and other major customers, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, rapid technological and market change, litigation, the potential impact of activities related to the execution of Juniper's Integrated Operating Plan and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC.","All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call.","Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website.","In today's call, we will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, other than revenue and share count, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance to GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded for non-GAAP guidance.","As a reminder, we completed the sale of our Junos Pulse security product line earlier this month. Please ensure your financial models are appropriately adjusted. Further information and our long-term model will be shared during our Investor Day later this month in New York City.","Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]","With that, I'll turn the call over to Shaygan.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. I wanted to give you an update on progress at Juniper, including the impact of industry trends on our revenues, our work on our Integrated Operating Plan and steps we are taking to ensure we are well positioned to deliver shareholder value going forward.","While we have made significant progress executing beyond our IOP commitments associated with capital return and operating expenses, we are disappointed with our revenue performance this quarter. Our Q3 revenue declined 5% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. The primary driver was lower-than-expected demand and slower ramp-up of new projects from service providers, particularly in the U.S. That said, our traction with Web 2.0 leaders has allowed us to partially offset the decline in carrier spending and increase the diversity of our revenue base.","Notwithstanding these industry headwinds, we delivered non-GAAP EPS within our guidance range. We did so by maintaining strong gross margins, diligently managing expenses and executing aggressively against our IOP capital return goals.","We have met or exceeded our commitments set forth in our Integrated Operating Plan in February while not losing sight of strategic engagements with key customers. We achieved our original cost reduction target this quarter by getting to a $500 million quarterly OpEx level from $539 million in fourth quarter of 2013. This came 2 quarters ahead of the original commitment. We're now further reducing our operating expense levels to $1,900,000,000 for the fiscal year 2015, a meaningful reduction from current levels.","We believe that by continuing to take this kind of surgical approach to our cost reduction efforts, we can still invest sufficiently to grow our business and lead the next wave of IP networking innovation. Our One-Juniper organizational structure is allowing us to get products to market faster and cheaper as our common operating system and coalesced engineering and go-to-market teams continue to operate faster and more efficiently. In fact, we are excited about our product pipeline ahead and pleased with progress in our pivot to strategic vertical markets focused on cloud building and high-IQ networking.","We have also exceeded our capital return commitment set forth at the Integrated Operating Plan. Our commitment through Q1 2015 was to return $2 billion of capital. We will return greater than that by Q4 2014. Our commitment through 2016 was to return $3 billion in capital. We have increased the size of our capital return program by $1.1 billion and now plan to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.","Given market conditions, we will take an aggressive stance and will plan to repurchase $1.5 billion by the end of Q2 2015. We also announced today a $0.10 per share cash dividend to be paid in Q4 with the intent to grow it in line with earnings over time.","I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the macro environment and our business. As I've stated previously, I believe the global networking market is at an inflection point, presenting substantial opportunities for growth. The underlying long-term demand trends support the need for increased investment in the network. Based upon historical trends and discussions with customers, we feel investment will return in the second half of next year, and that our integrated portfolio of routing, switching and security products will be well positioned to address critical customer requirements. Despite weaker macro conditions, the market fundamentals for Juniper's routing products continue to be healthy, and our customer base continues to be increasingly diversified.","In Security, we saw good demand for high-end SRX products from service providers. Switching revenue declined quarter-over-quarter as we experienced an ebb in the wave of customer build-outs that we saw earlier in the year. Though we continue to see momentum for our switching products, we expect modest improvements until the recent wave of customer design wins ramps in 2015. We continue to see our integrated solutions as a fundamental building block and a differentiating factor for customers of cloud building and high-IQ networking, including the focus on secure routing and switching solutions for active defense.","So what should you expect moving forward? We are focused on continuing to drive long-term shareholder value through profitable growth. We assume the carrier spending will remain constrained for several quarters, and we are streamlining our business with the before-mentioned operating expense reductions. We expect this to result in healthy year-over-year operating margin expansion in 2015.","I am enthusiastic about our technology roadmap to deliver the next wave of IP networking, and I'm confident in our strong market position. We remain intensely focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiatives. We appreciate the support of our shareholders and thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and relentless dedication to execution.","Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to provide more details on our financial results.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thank you, Shaygan, and good afternoon, everyone. The September quarter was challenging from a revenue perspective primarily because the Service Provider demand, particularly in the U.S., is slowing more than expected. Despite this, we delivered non-GAAP earnings within our original guidance range due to our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives.","Before I go into detail on the results of the quarter, I'd like to provide an update on our Integrated Operating Plan. We continue to make good progress against our targets. We have achieved our IOP quarterly operating expense target 2 quarters earlier than expected. We also completed the consolidation of our Sunnyvale campus and negotiated an early exit of our lease, which has resulted in a credit of $26 million against our prior restructuring estimate.","As announced on October 2, we finalized the sale of the Junos Pulse business. As a result, we anticipate booking a GAAP gain on the sale in Q4 of 2014. As expected, our Q3 results reflect a full quarter of this business.","We are executing well on our capital return plan. We paid our inaugural dividend of $0.10 per share in September. We also completed our $1.2 billion ASR in July and repurchased an additional $550 million of shares in Q3. Since inception of our Integrated Operating Plan, we have reduced our fully diluted share count by 10% and 13% over the last 2 years. I'm very pleased at the pace of our cost reductions and our progress towards a more efficient capital structure.","In the outlook section, I will provide detail on the additional costs and capital allocation action mentioned by Shaygan.","Now let's turn to an analysis of the Q3 results. Demand was relatively weak in the quarter. Our product book-to-bill was approximately 1, and bookings were almost $100 million less than we expected. Total product deferred revenue declined $57 million year-over-year and $29 million versus last quarter. The sequential decrease was mainly the result of the sell-through of channel-related inventory and the reclassification of the Junos Pulse deferred revenue to a held-for-sale asset category.","Total revenue for the quarter was $1,126,000,000, down 5% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Product revenue was $810 million, down 10% year-over-year and 13% over last quarter. Services revenue was $316 million, up 11% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.","For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.23, an increase of $0.04 year-over-year, including a $0.03 benefit from restructuring credit. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.36, up $0.03 year-over-year and down $0.04 versus last quarter. The sequential decrease was due to lower revenue, partially offset by improvements in gross margin and operating expenses.","Looking at our revenue for Q3. There were 4 primary factors which negatively impacted our results versus our expectations. U.S. carrier spending was worse than we had expected, and Web 2.0 Switching revenue was lower than anticipated due to the timing of deployments and the slower ramp of new projects. To a lesser extent, we saw a softening in the broad-based enterprise market and a greater-than-expected slowdown in demand from Eastern European service providers.","Now let's look at the revenue results in detail. Americas revenue was up 3% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. Americas Service Provider was up 1% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by Web 2.0 and cable provider growth, partially offset by decline from carrier demand. The sequential decline was driven by weak demand by large carriers and a significant reduction in Web 2.0 Switching revenue in the quarter, partially offset by continued strength in cable providers and Web 2.0 routing. Americas Enterprise was up 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Sequentially, we saw continued strength in the U.S. federal market and financial services, which was offset by some softness in the broad enterprise market.","EMEA revenue was down 5% over last year and 11% versus last quarter. The year-over-year decrease was due to declines in Western Europe and the Middle East, primarily in Service Providers, whilst the sequential decrease was driven by weakness in Eastern Europe.","APAC was down 28% year-over-year and 19% versus last quarter, primarily due to Service Provider weakness in China and Japan.","Service Provider revenue for the quarter was $742 million, down 6% year-over-year due to EMEA and APAC and U.S. carriers, partially offset by a slight increase in the Americas from Web 2.0 and cable providers. Sequentially, Service Provider revenue for the quarter was down 11% due to declines across all 3 geographies.","Enterprise revenue was $384 million, down 3% year-over-year and sequentially. APAC and EMEA were down in the broader enterprise market year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was partially offset by continued strength in the U.S. federal market and financial services.","By product area, Routing product revenue was $533 million, down 12% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. The declines were driven by weakness in the carrier market in both core and edge. We saw good traction in both the PTX and MX2020 product lines. Enterprise Routing was healthy.","Switching product revenue was $155 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year, driven by QFX into service providers, partially offset by a decline in the EX, mainly in the broad enterprise market. Sequentially, Switching product revenues declined 22%, coming off a record revenue in Q2. The decline was the result of lower demand from our Web 2.0 and softness from our broad enterprise customers.","Security product revenue was $121 million, down 16% year-over-year but up 9% versus last quarter. Our SRX platform and security software were down 6% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially, mainly as a result of increased demand by service providers.","Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 65.2% compared to 64.4% a year ago and 64.2% last quarter. The improvements were driven by an increase in both product and services gross margins. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 66.1%, up 0.7 points from both a year ago and last quarter, mainly due to favorability in product mix and reductions in costs. Non-GAAP gross margins for services were 63%, up 1.7 points from a year ago and 2.5 points versus last quarter. The increases were due to lower support-related costs from operational improvements and savings from variable costs.","We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $493 million, well below the range we gave last quarter, reflecting our focus on cost as well as the benefit of reduced variable costs in the quarter.","Our headcount at the end of the quarter was 9,059, which includes approximately 200 employees who transitioned as a result of the sale of the Junos Pulse business. Adjusting for the exiting Pulse employees, headcount declined 7% versus Q4 of 2013.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 21.5%, reflecting a year-over-year expansion of 1.7 points due to continued cost reductions. We experienced 0.1 point sequential of decline due to lower revenue, partially offset by improved gross margins and lower operating expenses.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 27% compared to 26% last quarter as a result of the increase in the mix of U.S.-based taxable income. The GAAP tax rate was 37.4% compared to 24.9% in Q2 due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings and other onetime items.","We ended the third quarter with approximately $2 billion of net cash and investments. The decline was primarily due to the capital return of $594 million. Onshore cash and investments represented approximately 26% of total gross cash balance.","For the quarter, we saw a net cash outflow from operations of $79 million, mainly due to timing differences in working capital, specifically an increase in accounts receivable, payments for incentive comp, tax payment and a reduction in deferred revenue. In Q4, we expect to return to our historical pattern of strong positive cash flows.","DSO was 49 days, up from 41 days last quarter due to the timing of shipments and invoicing linearity. Capital expenditures were $43 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $44 million.","Now I will provide our outlook for Q4. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. The demand environment for our largest U.S. carrier customers continues to be challenging. We have good relationships and design wins with these customers. However, the timing of deployments and improved demand is uncertain. At this stage, we are taking a prudent and cautious stance on revenue over the next several quarters.","As previously mentioned, we completed the sale of Junos Pulse, and the quarterly revenue impact of approximately $30 million has been factored into the Q4 guidance.","For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect revenues to range from $1,025,000,000 to $1,075,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be 64%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be $480 million, plus or minus $5 million. Operating margins are expected to be 18.5% at the midpoint of guidance. We expect a flat tax rate versus the third quarter. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.28 and $0.32 per share, assuming a weighted average share count of approximately 435 million. I'm also pleased to report that the board has approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter.","For the full year 2014, using the midpoint of Q4 guidance, revenues are expected to be approximately $4,576,000,000. Gross margins will be approximately 64%. Operating expenses will be approximately $2,030,000,000, and operating margins will be just under 20%. EPS is expected to be approximately $1.35. Excluding Junos Pulse revenues of $95 million for the first 3 quarters of 2014, Pulse adjusted full year revenue will be about $4,480,000,000.","Now I'd like to move into a discussion of how we are planning the business for 2015. We see the long-term demand drivers as healthy, and we are confident in our innovation pipeline. We continue to earn good design wins across our carrier, web services, cable and enterprise accounts. That said, we are planning for the overall revenue environment to be challenging over the next several quarters as near-term factors are impacting demand from our largest Service Provider customers.","Given this market environment, we are targeting 2015 operating expenses of $1,900,000,000, plus or minus $25 million. This is a $130 million reduction for our estimated full year 2014 operating expense levels and translates to a $260 million aggregate IOP commitment.","To achieve these additional savings, we will continue to carefully manage headcount, drive efficiency improvements and prioritize revenue-generating projects and resources. As part of our ongoing commitment to drive shareholder value, we also announced earlier today that the board has approved an additional $1.1 billion to the previously authorized capital return program. This brings our total capital return commitment to shareholders, including dividends, to $4.1 billion through 2016.","As a reminder, our original IOP commitment was to return $3 billion to shareholders through 2016. We have been opportunistic and aggressive in reducing our share count and have paid our first dividend. This brings the total return to shareholders through the end of Q3 2014 to $1.8 billion. We expect to continue to be opportunistic and aggressive in reducing our share count given the current market conditions, and we are currently expecting to complete a minimum of $1.5 billion in aggregate share repurchases before the end of Q2 2015. Given these additional actions, even with a cautious revenue outlook, we expect significant year-over-year operating margin and earnings per share expansion in 2015.","In summary, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders while maintaining the financial flexibility to invest in innovation and growth. I am very proud of our team and thank them for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper.","Now let's open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You gave some color on your expected operating expenses for 2015. Can you also let us know if you expect to grow next year? And can you help us understand how you're thinking about Q1 seasonality given the weaker second half? And then despite fairly soft router sales, you suggested fundamentals in the business remained healthy. So I was hoping to understand what's driving confidence here in this market. And given the carrier focus on NFV technologies and reducing costs, what leads you to believe the business will snap back in the second half?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Jess, this is Shaygan. I'll make a few comments and I'll pass it to Robyn. One, I would say that the visibility to revenue in the near term, in the next few quarters, is poor. And this is because we're going through a cycle, as you know, and these cycles take 2 to 4 quarters. We think it started last quarter. Plus, in our last earnings call, we also mentioned that there are some specific dynamics in the carrier market in the U.S. So put them all together, it gives us poor visibility into the near future on revenues. Because we think these cycles typically take 2 to 4 quarters, at this point in time, our planning assumption is that growth will return in the second half of 2015. And we're planning our business accordingly. Robyn, do want to say a few words?","Robyn M. Denholm","No, I think that's very good, Shaygan. In terms of the near-term environment, as we mentioned, for the fourth quarter, our guidance -- we obviously put that number out there. And then we do expect that we're in this 2- to 4-quarter cycle, as Shaygan talked about. For the full year next year, we're not putting out specific revenue numbers. As Shaygan mentioned, the environment is challenging. We expect that to continue for the next several quarters. So our planning assumptions at this point is that we expect that challenging environment to continue through the first half of next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi from UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Shaygan, if I look at Juniper over the last 4 years, you had an up year, a down year, an up year, a down year. And it seems like the company is becoming increasingly cyclical. So I guess I wanted to get your thoughts. We talk a lot about a lot of secular underlying drivers, but we're not quite seeing it in your business. And so would love to get your thoughts in terms of can we get a secular growth trajectory for Juniper or is the company increasingly now cyclical?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Amitabh, good question. I mean, if you look at the curves, your statement is actually correct. It looks like sinusoids going back many years. But you also -- the other observation is the magnitude of the sinusoids are coming down in terms of how they swing. What I can say is our business is increasingly diversified. If you look at it this year, Amitabh, most of our growth has come from Web 2.0s, a little bit from cable and so forth. So our strategic vertical that these are selected, we selected them for this specific purpose because we think, be it cable, carrier, Web 2.0, financial services, federal government and so forth, these are the verticals that are going to carry us forward. And we think while some are taller than others in terms of growth capability, we think over the medium to long term, they're going to be within -- I mean, some of them are going to be within the same zone. So we see continued diversity of revenue, but we are -- traditionally has been -- we have a carrier base. And as you know, the carrier CapEx cycles do exist, and it's something that we don't control industry spend. And when they swing down, we swing down with them. And when they go up, we go up with them. But now we have these other 3 engines, and we expect them to grow over time. Robyn, any more comments on that?","Robyn M. Denholm","I think -- I think that said it well. I think also the question around the router cycles and whether we expect them to continue, I think Rami can comment on that as well.","Rami Rahim","Sure, happy to. I mean, when I look at the Routing fundamentals, obviously the first thing you're going to look at is traffic. And all our indication is that traffic continues to grow across all of our customer base, whether it be the Web service providers, telcos, cable operators. I think that's sort of a truth among all of them. There are certainly trends that are happening in the industry and where -- these are obviously trends that we factor into our strategy. But when you take a look at these trends, whether they be Layer 4 to Layer 7, service virtualization or things like the virtualization of the CPE, so low-end routing virtualization or SDN for the purpose of automation, I view these as all largely complementary to our strategy. So this is very much an opportunity for us. It's very, very difficult to virtualize the kind of product, or I'd say impossible, to virtualize the kind of product that solved the performance necessary to deal with capacity growth. So this is why I'm confident in the long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pierre Felgaru (sic) [Pierre Ferragu] from Bernstein.","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So you -- on the Service Provider front, you mentioned specific dynamics that prevent the carriers to spend in the near term. I think we understand well what's happening in the U.S. You have like the debate with Netflix. You have like net neutrality. You have ongoing merger discussions. But what was very surprising this quarter is actually weakness of your revenues in the rest of the world. You mentioned China. You mentioned Eastern Europe. You mentioned Japan as well. Could you maybe review these geographies one by one? And maybe tell us -- it's probably like 2, 3 major clients in each of them. So it would be helpful to get some kind of color on what's happening, what's creating this lack of visibility in these regions as well?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thanks, Pierre, for the question. Actually, we have Vince Molinaro here, who is our Executive Vice President for go-to-market globally. And he -- Vince, can you respond to Pierre...","Vincent J. Molinaro","Sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question, Pierre. Like Robyn discussed and mentioned, we were down in Asia Pacific, primarily because of China and Japan, largely due to Service Provider and a few projects that have come to conclusion. And we have seen a first half with some real good design wins that will carry forward. As I look into Q4, in Asia Pacific in general, look to flat to slightly up. And the reason for that, from my perspective, we're seeing growth in Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Southeast Asia in general for opportunities for the broad portfolio. Rami just mentioned traffic growth, and specifically in that part of the world, LTE and mobile build-outs presenting opportunities for us in access and aggregation in mobile backhaul as well as traditional core routing, edge and security. I'll also say in Asia Pacific, the focus in our verticals is beginning to resonate with both our Service Provider and Enterprise customers, particularly in Web and in cloud provider, Web 2.0 companies in India and Japan. So hopefully, that rounds out the picture for you. In EMEA -- in EMEA, I kind of characterize that steady as they go. Good first half. And again, as Robyn mentioned, some geopolitical issues in Eastern Europe and Middle East. We are seeing good traction with new design wins across the entire portfolio. And again, that is in our Enterprise and our Service Provider business across all verticals and even in the strategic verticals like higher education, for example. I think the other area of opportunity, the European providers, they typically invest as the demand presents itself. Traffic is growing in EMEA, 38% to 50% in the public space year-on-year. High network utilization, so we're -- and everything mobile. And that growth is pretty significant. So we're watching the industry dynamic and in the geographies that Robyn mentioned. But in general, we just see a steady trend going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum from Citigroup.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have a couple of clarifications first before my question. First of all, Robyn, I just want to make sure that you didn't mention anything about the 25% operating margin target for 2015. If you can comment on that, if that's still on the table. You didn't mention it, so I'll put that out there as a clarification. Lower OpEx, another clarification. How much of that, Robyn, was reversal of prior bonus accruals so not really where the OpEx would've been if we were doing it on a quarter-by-quarter basis? Third, Switching, obviously, fell pretty substantially and you gave some good reasons. I'm assuming within that, was it mainly the Web guys you're talking about? Are there other verticals that we should just be aware of in there? Was U.S. Service Provider in there? And then finally, Kathleen, I know you're going to love this, but AT&T CapEx, if you look at what they did, they're obviously a big part of what you guys do and dictate a lot. They were very strong in the first half of the year. They haven't change their full year number, $21 billion. It's still pretty much set in stone. So if you mapped out AT&T's CapEx, wireless, wireline, however you slice it, the fall-off in Q3 and the further fall-off in Q4 was put in stone back in June, July. So what really did change as you went through this quarter that seemed to be a surprise versus what AT&T was telling you? Was it kind of a mix in that CapEx number? Because the total CapEx number seems to kind of flow with what your new numbers are versus what you had previously thought going into the preannouncement.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, Ehud. So there were 4 comments there, 2 clarifications, 2 questions. We will address 2 of them, 1 clarification and 1 question. Which would like them to be?","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. How about the lower OpEx bonus accruals for the clarification and then the AT&T CapEx question for the question.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay. All right. You got it. Thanks, Ehud.","Robyn M. Denholm","So I'll address the OpEx question. So you're right, we did have some variable comp in the quarter in Q3. I actually called it out in the script. We said it was about $10 million in terms of the fourth quarter guidance. So in other words, we did 4 -- we're putting out $480 million, plus or minus $5 million. There's about $8 million to $10 million in there that's variable-comp related.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Yes. And Ehud, on your second question, obviously, we don't comment on any specific customer. So let me make my comments general. And in fact, I read your report. Nice job on the one you've just recently written on another customer on the same issue. And I think it's -- you can project that to my comments. So it's -- as you said, it's the mix and where service providers are spending their money and what part of the network. That's the answer to the question, essentially. And so it is -- if that's in the mix area, that is the answer to the question.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks, Ehud.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Kvaal from Northland.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","My question is, I think, a number of us on this side do worry a little bit about the declining R&D budget and to make sure that the pipeline continues to generate the technical -- technically leading products that you are known for. Could you give us a little bit -- perhaps maybe a bit of an example of how you can be reducing the R&D and yet continuing to not suffer from a thinner pipeline of product or maybe an example of where the efficiency has come into play? I think that would be helpful.","Shaygan Kheradpir","So Jeff, I'll make a few comments and I'll then have Rami go into perhaps examples and give more color. So first of all, in the whole Integrated Operating Plan, the issue has been focus and unleashing the talent of our best R&D and go-to-market people for innovation. And so we said that many, many times we know R&D is the lifeblood of this company. In fact, I am super excited about the product pipeline, and this is not infinity. This is in front of us. So you should rest assured that innovation and engineering and product pipeline is healthy. It's broad. It's deep and it's very exciting. And so you should just rest assured on that. And we are very focused to ensure that our R&D is focused on things that matter to the customers, where the market is going and making sure that we are not wasting our resources in areas that don't matter. Now with that, I'll pass it to Rami.","Rami Rahim","Sure. So most of, if not all, of the changes that we've done in R&D to reduce the OpEx have been structural in nature. So it's around streamlining the organization in such a way that allows us to deduplicate functions that were, quite frankly, duplicated only because of the organizational design. So that has been eliminated. Beyond that, we've been very, very vigilant with respect to the priorities of the projects that we're working on, making sure that everything that we are working on is aligned 100% with the company's strategy. And as you know, we've said in the past, that has resulted in stopping development of certain projects and products. So there are a number of pre-revenue-generating projects we were working on that we are not anymore. We just divested the Pulse business as you are aware of not because it's a bad business but because of the fact that we could not invest in it ourselves and also all of the other things that we know we need to do for the company's strategy. The last thing I will say is now that all of R&D is in a single organization, one of the fundamental tenets, if you will, of our engineering principles is to leverage, is to make sure that all of our technology components across silicon systems and software are highly leverageable across all of our product lines. And this is something that we're very much executing towards.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thanks, Rami.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I look at the year-over-year decline, it's actually the worst in the company's history since the IPO. And that's despite the company being more diversified and despite traffic growing every single year. So underneath the cyclical nature, is there a fundamental change that's going on in the business? Is there an increasing structural issue, price deflation, shifts in purchasing power by carriers? And if that's the case, we understand you're addressing the OpEx for the cyclical part, but what are the plans to address the structural part?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Mark, yes. I think if you look at the numbers, the overwhelming majority of this is carriers. It's U.S. carriers. It is the cyclical nature of their buying. Once you open that cover, there are things. There are pluses and minuses, and they always are in the business. But I would say is that is the bulk of the issue that we saw in the third quarter. Robyn, do want to say a few words on that?","Robyn M. Denholm","No, I think that covered it, actually.","Operator","Next question comes from Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs.","Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a clarification and a question as well. Just on the clarification, again, I wanted to follow up on the question on 25% operating margin for next year, if that's still on the table as your target. And then my question was just digging in a little bit into the Switching business given the sharp decline there. Can you just characterize for us a little bit how lumpy that business is in terms of customer concentration? Are there are a handful of maybe 10%, 15% customers in there that could have driven the magnitude that we saw in the decline?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Simona, I'll take a crack at that quickly at both, and then on the second one, I'll pass it again to Rami. So on the first one, 25% is our long-term target and very achievable. The visibility to revenue, as you know, has turned quite poor just in the past 6 weeks. If you look at the CapEx numbers from the big carriers, you would see how they have changed and it's just the past 4 to 6 weeks. What we control is our costs, our products, our customer relationships, the design wins. All of those are well in hand. We've got great customer relationships, a lot of design wins. On the costs, we have given you definitive numbers, which is 1.9, minus 25, plus 25. And based on our track record on our costs so far, you can see how we come with costs. We're doing that while preserving ability to invest sufficiently for growth despite the challenging environment. And when you put it all together, we're going to expand operating margins significantly from 2014 to 2015. And this is just arithmetic, this number, depends on revenue. And revenue, we don't control industry spend. The visibility is poor. And these things can change very quickly. They have just in the past 6 weeks. And so whenever -- and we are constructive on the second half of this year. We think we're going to get growth back. That will depend on the revenue number. But we are very focused on the 25%, and we think it's very achievable as a long-term target.","Rami Rahim","Switching. So should I comment on Switching? Simona, so first, to your question about concentration. Certainly, there is a Service Provider and an Enterprise component to our Switching business. The Service Provider component tends to be fewer larger deals, fewer larger customers than the Enterprise. That's natural. We've always said that the SP portion is going to be lumpy, and this quarter was certainly an example of that. And I would say, I mean, we're certainly disappointed in our results. I think we can and will do better in Switching. So what gives me confidence about the Switching business going forward? First is we've had a number of wins that just haven't yet been -- gone into deployment mode that will kick in, in future quarters. Second is if you take a look at what we've done in Switching in terms of R&D over the last couple of years is we've realigned the organization. We've focused it on a new strategy and product roadmap, and we're now just starting to see the results of that strategy in terms of new products like the QFX5100 being a great example of that. But we're not done yet, and there's more to come. And I have a lot of confidence in what is more to come in terms of our ability to grow this business. And I'll just pass it to Vince for performance.","Vincent J. Molinaro","Yes. Now let me just tag on that, Rami, with respect to Shaygan mentioned the vertical focus and the customer differentiation. We're starting to see both in Service Provider and in Enterprise a number of data center wins to leverage the portfolio and positioning forward, especially in the massively scalable data centers. We're seeing a much broader architectural conversation that puts us in a position for continued growth. So I'm excited about that. And then automation and everything else that's going on relative to the environment in the data center, looking forward to again diversity and portfolio of customers where we have applications that position and drive our Switching business. So thanks.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Yes. And I'll just wrap it up, Simona, on -- as Rami and Vince said, I'm actually very encouraged by all of the vertical engagements on Switching and the design wins, and I'm enthusiastic about the ramp in 2015.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks, Simona.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I think when you [indiscernible] data, about whether it's a cyclical issue in Routing or if there's something more structural going on, like maybe Metro Optical using that Switching substitution for some of the Routing. The question is really around Switching in terms of -- are you guys planning to do a spine switch? This is clearly an area as you note that you could see some growth in because there's still growth in Switching and you have a small market share. So are you going to do anything architecturally to really get into that market in a bigger way?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Brian, we obviously are not here to unveil our product roadmap. Suffice it to say, as I said, I'm personally very excited about it. And I think it was Brian's report we just recently read, right? We have a lot of comments on that, but that we'll take up online. But Rami, can you sort of take that?","Rami Rahim","Sure. So look, on the Switching side, I'll just sort of revert back to what I mentioned for Simona, which is that we're not done with our roadmap. We're not going to get into specifics on this call. But I think there's a lot of confidence all around on our roadmap. And in terms of talking to customers, we're getting a lot of very positive feedback on the roadmap. As far as Metro optical and so forth, there are certainly trends and aspirations by all involved in that market. And one can easily talk about IP and packet-based transport and so forth, but actually executing on that, there aren't that many people in the world that can effectively do it and do it competitively and scalably. So for that reason, I'm not 100% sure I agree with the premise that there is sort of this long-drawn-out trend, if you will, in Routing where everything will move to optical. I just don't buy it. That said, there are -- there is an evolution in architectures for the Metro and even for the core where the packet and optical demands will be much closely integrated together. This will be done with things like intelligent software that can balance traffic more effectively across the 2 layers, also done in terms of automation. And if you look at our product roadmap with respect to, for example, NorthStar, this is the controller that does exactly that. It does it with our own packet technology and partner optical technology. And we're seeing, actually, some very good interest from customers. I think it's early, but we're seeing very good interest from customers on such approaches.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you. Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Back to the Switching question. Could you just -- I think the Enterprise number for Switching might have been below as well what you were thinking at the beginning of the quarter. And what did you notice competitively there with Cisco ramping new products and Arista doing things? And I guess everybody's asking 2 questions so I'll sneak one other in there. Strategically, you guys have done the IOP and the Junos divestiture. But is there any other strategic options on the table? Anything else that we should be thinking about that you have in your ability to enhance shareholder value that we haven't looked at yet in the analyst community?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Ben, I'll make a couple of quick comments and then I'll pass it around. So on Switching, we are actually quite bullish about our Switching products. They really shine most where scale, sophistication, openness, programmability, hardened IP protocols, those things matter. And so we are very bullish about that. As far as your comment, your second comment, we -- as a matter of course, we review our portfolio regularly. And we are in that sort of phase and that's how our process works. So we do that regularly. But Rami, can you take a crack on the Enterprise question specifically?","Rami Rahim","Yes. I mean, most of the -- most of what affected us in Q3 in Switching was on the SP -- in SPs. And that's, again, the lumpier portion of our business. There was also a broader Enterprise component, but it was a minor component compared to the SP side. As far as strategy is concerned, it's scoring and winning more and more of the opportunities from customers that truly, like Shaygan said, value high capacity and high scale. And those customers tend to be fewer and larger. So there is -- again, there's that lumpiness component to it. And then also, like I said, there is still an element to our product roadmap that has not yet been completed that I think is going to be necessary to make sure that we continue the growth. So that's, again, what it is that we're counting on for continued growth in the future.","Vincent J. Molinaro","And I think from a customer perspective, you've seen the announcement on Nike, and that is a complete portfolio but switch-led. And those are the kinds of opportunities, when you take the full portfolio, leveraging the competence and capability of our switch platform, allows us to get into these global data centers, allows us to provide the agility both on a converged campus as well as among data centers to deliver private cloud. And so I think that's a good example, and it's just a ramp and replication of more opportunities like that where we either lead with routing and pull the switch or lead with switch and pull the broader portfolio. And then I -- think about MetaFabric in general, which is the Routing, Switching, Security where we can lead with that enabling switch technology and pull through the entire portfolio and create that end-to-end solution for customers like Nike and others that we're winning designs around that need to move into production. But it is that better together with leveraging the switch and pulling the rest. MetaFabric is, I think, a perfect example of that.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thank you, Ben.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kulbinder from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I guess my question is that you spoke before, Shaygan, about the product cycle, and it normally lasts 2 to 4 quarters. I guess the question is -- this still seems to have materially surprised Juniper. So my question is what is it about the product cycle that surprised you this time and transpired because you -- you have had these cycles before, but this seems to have caught Juniper by surprise again. And I guess just linked to that, I guess the secular concern would be is there something more serious competitive going on, and how would you respond to that kind of concern?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Yes, I mean, it's a good question. It's difficult to call cycles. I think there are a number of analysts on this call right now and I'm not sure how many of us would have called the cycle. And as I said, in addition to that, there is some -- what also complicated it in terms of visibility, Kul, is some specific industry dynamics that is going on. So those 2 together make visibility quite poor, and the industry dynamics isn't one. It's probably, I would say, half a dozen things, and some of them are different on one customer than the other. And then on top of it, you've got the sinusoid with noise fluctuating around it. So I guess that's the answer. And we all wished that we could tell the cycles, but we didn't see it and I don't think many people did either. And in fact, just in the past 6 weeks, we've gotten -- the numbers have moved on CapEx as well on the area that we work.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess just on the...","Shaygan Kheradpir","Rami, do you have any other comments?","Kathleen Nemeth","Go ahead, Kulbinder, and then we'll take one more question.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I guess my question and follow-up would be just you mentioned the need for revenue diversity. With the new products, the new projects, is it fair to say that you would have the revenue diversity in a year that you can mitigate some of this going forward beyond that? Is that what it might take to get this diversity of revenue that you think Juniper might need?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. I think, Kulbinder, on the diversity of revenue, that obviously takes time. And we will have more information next week at the Investor Day on how diverse some of our revenue has gotten over the last 5 years. But to Shaygan's point, we obviously still have some concentration around carriers. And in particular, when those cycles happen, sometimes it's very difficult to get visibility into the depth or breadth of the cycle. And so you're right, the depth of it did exceed our expectations in this quarter. But our view is, at this point, that we're planning for the revenue environment to be challenging. And we've obviously taken appropriate actions in terms of the cost structure and making sure that we're investing in the right things over the right period of time to catch the wave of growth as we come out of this cycle. And that's what the team is very focused on doing.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thanks, Robyn. Thanks, Kul.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you. We have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","She's been killing names all night. Ittai. Yes. I guess my question is more on the incremental OpEx cuts. Shaygan, Robyn, I know cuts are never easy. And when you first announced the IOP plan, you had a very heavy OpEx structure where, I would say, on a relative basis, it was easier to identify the cost-cutting. I guess the question from here, how easy or difficult is it to squeeze that extra $100 million out there? Are the things that you need to do a bit more structural and longer in duration in order to squeeze those cuts? Or they can be -- whether either easily identified or quickly extracted? Can you give us some color on the process there? That would be great.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Ittai, yes, we did IOP that we announced in February for $160 million. We are doing $100 million more. On a year-over-year basis, it's $130 million more in OpEx savings that we are doing. It's a variety of actions. I would say the first $160 million we did, it was tilted more heavily towards the structural things we need to do. Robyn will talk to some of that. This one, we've got a little bit of that. But we also, in IOP, said that we are also sharpening that muscle of continuous focus on efficiency and ensuring that all our dollars go to where it matters most. And this is a reflection of the company strengthening that muscle to be able to take yet another 130 million year-over-year out while preserving a very exciting R&D portfolio, and as Robyn said, be in a position to catch the revenue growth that, from a planning perspective, we are announcing in the second half of next year. Robyn?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, I think Shaygan said it well. What we're trying to do -- what we are doing is continuing to sharpen our focus in terms of productivity and efficiency across the company. And as you could see by the results for the third quarter, we are ahead of plan of the original IOP. And so our view is that we can take these additional costs out. It's never easy to take cost out, as you mentioned in your question. But with the right focus and the right attention, doing that deliberately across the company by managing headcount and continuing to work through discretionary expenses as well as effectiveness and efficiency across the company. And the team's very well aligned around that.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks, Ittai. Okay. That is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank you for participating on the call and your great questions, in some cases clarifications. And we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"12629":["Juniper Networks, Inc.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, VP of Investor Relations.","Jess Lubert - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","Our discussions today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Our 2Q 2018 results and forward-looking guidance are provided under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.","With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported better-than-expected results during the June quarter. Total revenue of $1,204 million was at the high end of our guidance, as strong results in our Enterprise business complemented seasonal sequential improvements in our Cloud and Service Provider verticals.","Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 exceeded the high end of our guidance due to higher revenue, gross margin improvement and continued cost discipline. While our Q2 results were better than guidance, I'd like to provide some insight into our Q3 forecast, which is being impacted by the following factors.","First, we experienced a strong close to the June quarter, and some of the Enterprise business we expected to close in Q3 happened a bit sooner than we previously anticipated. Second, the timing of certain Cloud and Service Provider orders we had expected in Q3 are taking a bit longer to materialize, although some are likely to contribute later this year. We remain confident that we are holding or expanding our footprint, and in many cases, gaining mindshare at our most important customers. My confidence is based on the rich conversations we're having with these customers, as well as strong pipeline for the December quarter.","These factors are not only leading us to believe that our soft Q3 forecast is mostly a function of timing, but that we remain on track to see a return to year-over-year growth during the December quarter.","I'm confident that we have the right products and strategy to win across our core verticals, and we are continuing to innovate with a goal of disrupting our markets and gaining share. In this regard, we expect to bring a number of new innovations to market over the next few quarters, including the industry's first 400-gig optimized routing platform, new programmable high-performance MX systems and line cards, an upgrade to our SRX High-End Firewall offering and an industry-leading, multi-cloud orchestration and telemetry platform, each of which, we believe, will help strengthen our position across our core markets.","Now for a few highlights of the quarter. Our Enterprise business experienced strong momentum during the June quarter, growing 9% year-over-year, marking the 6th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Strength was broad-based across geographies, verticals and technologies. While we expect some seasonality during Q3, we believe our Enterprise momentum remained strong due to execution and a compelling portfolio of Enterprise offerings. We saw a modest sequential improvement in the Cloud vertical, where several of our largest customers are transitioning from our MX to our PTX platforms.","While this process is creating year-over-year ASC pressure in our cloud routing business that is likely to persist over the next few quarters, we believe we are making progress through this transition, despite some lumpiness in the business.","As evidence of our progress, I would like to highlight that our cloud routing business experienced a second consecutive quarter of sequential growth during the June quarter. Our PTX products accounted for approximately 80% of cloud routing ports we shipped on a 10-gig equivalent basis during Q2, compared to roughly 60% a year ago. Our cloud routing ASPs continue to see signs of stabilization on a sequential basis, a trend we think is likely to continue through the rest of the year. Based on the feedback from our customer engagements, we remain confident that we are holding our cloud routing footprint and positioning the business to capitalize on this customer set's rising network requirements.","Our Service Provider business experienced normal seasonal trends during the June period. While we expect our Service Provider sales to decline sequentially during the September quarter, we do see the potential for some improvement during the December period, due to the expected timing of deployment. We are continuing to innovate in this vertical and differentiate our solutions relative to those of our peers. We believe these efforts are resonating in the market and should position Juniper to gain share as service providers move forward with Metro initiatives and 5G build-outs, which could present tailwinds for our business over the next few years.","Now I would like to summarize our performance across Routing, Switching and Security. In Routing, our business increased sequentially, but declined year-over-year. While the architectural transition within the cloud continued to present year-over-year headwinds, we experienced healthy quarter-over-quarter growth during the June period due to strong uptake of several new products and a seasonal recovery in our Service Provider business, which bounced back following a soft Q1. Though cloud customers are transitioning to our PTX platform, we're not seeing this dynamic in our Service Provider vertical, due to the need for service creation capabilities the MX provides.","In Switching, our business increased quarter-over-quarter, but declined year-over-year. While our concentrated hyperscale switching business declined year-over-year on a difficult comparison due to the same scale out architectural transition impacting Routing, excluding this business, we saw high single-digit growth, including double-digit growth in QFX. Based on our pipeline and customer feedback, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our QFX and EX product lines, which we believe remain well-positioned to compete across industry verticals, including Cloud and hyperscale accounts.","The strength of our Switching portfolio was recently validated by being named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networking.","In Security, our business grew 16% year-over-year, representing a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We believe more customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection enforcement against cyber threats. We believe our portfolio remains very competitive and remain optimistic that our Security business will see year-over-year growth for the full year, 2018.","We are making progress with our efforts to capture more software revenue, which grew 28% year-over-year. We're seeing momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins in the quarter, including three global Tier 1 carriers and a Fortune 500 Enterprise account. We believe we are executing on an extremely compelling product roadmap for Contrail, and we expect our Enterprise Multicloud capability will begin shipping this quarter. Additionally, AppFormix continues to gain traction with new wins in the Service Provider and Enterprise verticals.","While the impact of ASC 606 caused our Services revenue to decline year-over-year, we saw strong renewal and a tax rate of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services. If not for ASC 606 accounting change, our Service business would have experienced 9% growth year-over-year.","In summary, while our business remains lumpy and sometimes difficult to predict on a quarterly basis, we remain confident that we are on track to deliver a return to growth by the end of the year. We believe we are innovating in ways which truly matter to our customers. We are executing on the right side of change in our industry and positioning the business to see improved long-term success.","I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders.","I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the second quarter were better than expected with a total second quarter revenue of $1.204 billion non-GAAP gross margin of 59.1%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48; all above the midpoint of our guidance. We saw sequential growth across all verticals, led by Enterprise, which increased 20%, driven by the growth in all technologies. Enterprise also posted its 6th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth at 9%.","The Service Provider vertical was up 9% sequentially, in line with seasonal trends, and declined 7% year-over-year, due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Without this revenue recognition change, Service Provider would have been essentially flat year-over-year.","Cloud revenues increased 4% sequentially, but declined 26% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects continued architectural headwinds and the pace of deployments. As Rami mentioned, we remain confident in our position with our strategic cloud customers. However, the timing of deployments may continue to vary.","During the quarter, Routing and Switching both increased to double-digits sequentially, and the positive momentum in Security continued, growing 9% quarter over quarter. Security posted a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, increasing 16%. Our Switching business declined 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by the weakness in Cloud and Service Provider.","Routing saw a 14% decline year-over-year, primarily due to the ongoing architectural shift in Cloud. PTX grew on a year-over-year basis. In reviewing our top-10 customers for the quarter, six were Cloud, three were Service Provider and one was in Enterprise.","Product deferred revenue declined in the second quarter, primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, product deferred revenue would have increased 13% year-over-year.","For the quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 59.1%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to higher revenue, while the year-over-year decline was primarily related to mix and lower revenue.","Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% sequentially, and 1% year-over-year, due to prudent cost management. Cash flow from operations was $170 million for the quarter, a decline of $128 million year-over-year, and $101 million sequentially. These declines reflect lower collections and higher tax payments. The higher tax payments are a result of the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the first of eight annual installments related to the transition tax. In addition, we paid $63 million in dividends. Our total cash, cash equivalents and investment balance at the end of the June quarter was $3.5 billion, a modest increase versus last quarter.","Before we move on to the question and answer part of the call, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our Investor Relations site.","Our Q3 revenue guidance reflects stronger-than-expected Q2 business, particularly in Enterprise, as well as the timing of certain Cloud and Service Provider deployments which are taking longer to materialize. In addition, we are working through some industry-wide supply constraints related to certain power management components, which could further impact our lead times in Q3.","At this time, we believe we will be largely able to mitigate this issue. Therefore, it is not a significant factor within our guidance. However, it could impact our future results. While customer spending remains dynamic and difficult to predict, we continue to expect to return to year-over-year growth during the December quarter.","We expect non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter to remain stable in Q3 and improve with volume over time. However, the pace of this improvement could be impacted by mix, as well as other factors. We expect annual non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat on a year-over-year basis.","In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.","Now I would like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Tim Long, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Yeah, just a question and a clarification; so just on the Cloud delays, maybe if you could just talk a little bit, Rami, about maybe how broad across the customer base are those delays; is it just one or two customers and kind of what the root cause is. Is it just still testing the product or is there something else at bay there? I'm assuming you don't think it's looking at other solutions \u2013 competitive solutions. And then secondly, on the Cloud topic, can you talk a little bit about Switching and trying to get a little bit more traction into the Cloud vertical and the hyperscale players and maybe touch on where you're thinking the insertion point would be, and does 400 gig help you there \u2013 give you a window into that customer base? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Tim. So, good set of questions. First, as far as the cloud routing goes and our position with cloud routing, it's the same architectural shift we've been talking about, 10 gig to 100 gig scale-out. Certainly, a platform transition from MX to PTX, that are all coming to bear. Our view \u2013 coming into the year, our view of the full year in terms of that transition has always been this is going to take multiple quarters, and it's playing out that way. Predicting exactly when the big deployments are going to happen, especially internationally, as data centers get deployed around the globe, is easier said than done.","However, I do want to just make sure that you all understand, I remain very confident that we are in an extremely strong position with our Cloud customers. As you just heard from Ken, 6 of our 10 top customers in Q2 were, in fact, Cloud customers were already designed into many of the next generation networks that need to be deployed.","You asked about, sort of, how broad-based or not; well, we're talking about hyperscalers here, so it only takes a couple of customers to move the needle pretty significantly. Certification of our software and our products, for the most part, have either already been completely done or is getting completed and the conversations with our customers at \u2013 down at the engineering level have never been stronger.","And finally, maybe the last data point I'll offer is just that we've seen abnormally rapid ASP declines as a result of the MX to PTX transition over the last several quarters, but now that's starting to stabilize, which is a good indication of the fact that at least a good part of that transition is behind us. So, all of these factors give me a lot of confidence that this is more a quarter timing issue than it is anything more fundamental than that. I do not believe it's a competitive issue.","And then on your question around Switching, I'm glad you asked it because I still believe that Switching is an incredible opportunity for us to take share in the large cloud or Tier 1 cloud vertical. We're already seeing great momentum in the Enterprise, validated now by being in the leader's quadrant in the Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Networking; we are seeing really good and solid momentum in the Tier 2 space; we are looking at the 400-gig inflection point that is coming next year as an opportunity for us to take share in hyperscale switching; and we've announced a broad set of products, 400-gig interfaces, across all of our Routing and Switching portfolio, as well as two new platforms, Routing and Switching, that will be available before the end of this year that are 400-gig optimized. So, our intention of capturing that wave early is playing out as we expect, and I think that's going to be very helpful for us.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","My pleasure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Leopold, Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you very much. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about maybe levers that influence your gross margin, and in particular, what I'm trying to really get to is, in the fourth quarter, when you expect to return to year-over-year growth, it would imply improved volume. And so, I'm just trying to get an idea, how much of the gross margin would be driven by volume versus mix? Thank you.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Simon. Good questions. So as we we've been stating, the decline this year is largely both volume and mix related; volumes should recover, and we expect Q4 to be growth year-on-year as you mentioned. However, the mixed headwinds that we've seen, namely the Switching in becoming a bigger piece of overall revenue stream, as well as the MX to PTX, some of those mix headwinds on the product side will not recover this year. I do expect us to grow margin beyond this year as volume grows and mix kind of stabilizes, but I don't expect a recovery beyond that. We'll see some improvement from volume, but we won't get back to FY2017 levels because the mixed impacts will remain throughout this year.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. And just as a follow up, I wanted to see if you could quantify the software business. I think, in the past, you've given us a couple metrics; I think 2015 was 3%; 2017, if I recall, 6% of revenue from software; I just want to see where we are today to help me understand the baseline.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, so those metrics still hold, and we did say this quarter we grew software 27% year-on-year. So our software business continues to outpace the rest of our businesses actually, from a growth perspective, and we're very excited about the opportunity. We've talked \u2013 we've recently talked a lot about the Contrail Enterprise Multicloud product that we announced earlier this year; that should be shipping soon, and we think that's going to drive a lot of momentum in the whole Enterprise data center solution, which is really a software-led solution.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","But as a portion of revenue, it's below 10%, but above the 6% last year?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal, Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Thank you, gentlemen. I was hoping to dial a little bit in to the Service Provider side that you mentioned in the third quarter guidance. What are the dynamics that are going on there and, in the back of my mind, of course, Verizon seems like they're being a bit more aggressive on price, so that's more of a sustainable shift rather than a push-out by a quarter or so.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff. Let me start and maybe Ken has some additional comments. I think, honestly, it's more of the same when it comes to the Service Provider space. We did see a good sequential recovery from a Q1 low, but generally speaking, the dynamics in the market are around telcos being prudent with their spend, consolidation, M&A activity, unlimited data plans, that are all putting pressure on their ability to invest.","Now, we see the same CapEx reports that you saw coming out of the large Tier 1 telcos, which suggest that second half would be better than the first half. I do believe that will translate to better dynamics for Juniper, specifically.","I'm optimistic from a new architecture and new solutions standpoint for telcos, but this is going to play out over the next several years. Examples would be, all telcos are looking at deploying some form of a telco cloud, from which they will deliver next-generation services to the Enterprise or for 5G, and Juniper is quickly developing a reputation of being a trusted advisor to the deployment of such telco cloud initiatives. And in fact, we just won another Tier 1 telco in Europe, which is rolling out this sort of telco cloud to offer next-generation services, and we're very proud of that.","I think there could be other catalysts like 5G deployments in Metro, but quite frankly, this is not something that we're modeling into our assumptions over the next few quarters. It's something that we're hopeful will help over the next couple of years.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","The only thing I would add is while we do expect a modest decline sequentially in Q3, we do expect the second half in our Service Provider to be stronger than the first half. So, it's just kind of a timing game at this point. From a pricing perspective, we aren't seeing anything beyond normal when it comes to pricing pressure; it's always been a heightened pricing pressure environment, but we aren't seeing anything unusual at this point from a pricing perspective.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Thanks, Ken. And then would you mind reminding us where we are with the headwinds from memory pricing and maybe we'll start \u2013 if we might see the benefit of that as memory pricing starts to improve over the next few quarters?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, so at this point, it's been stable all year. We expect it to remain stable throughout this year. We could see some favorable pricing beginning next year, but at this point we're seeing stable.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Thank you, both.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein, Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","I appreciate you taking the question. I heard the response to the last question, but Rami, Ken, I just want to make sure, with the new MX platform and with telcos having observed what the cloud hyperscale folks have been doing, you're not expecting any significant step-down in pricing, and the new MX platform doesn't, on a like-for-like basis, if we look at per-port pricing, clearly from your comments, there's not going to be that type of step-down or anything close to it.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Paul, and I'm glad you asked. The answer is, yes, you're right, I do not anticipate anything remotely close to the kind of transition that we've seen from MX to PTX in the Cloud space; and it's primarily a matter of the kinds of services that telcos are typically delivering over the MX \u2013 and it's playing out as we expect. I mean, we monitor the MX to PTX ratio both in the Cloud as well as in other verticals, especially the telco vertical, and they just look very, very different. But beyond that, the MX itself will see a substantial amount of innovation that will enhance not only its programmability, but its performance as well as the economics on a per-bit basis in each line card.","We just recently announced a new silicone generation, the Penta Silicon generation for the MX that will start to ship in the early part of next year that brings all of the tens of thousands of MX chasses that are deployed now around the world, an opportunity for an upgrade. And I think that just reduces the incentives for many of the telcos to move aggressively to another platform like the PTX. I'll just close by saying, every time we have introduced a next-generation of line cards for the MX that bring up the performance and reduce the cost per bid, we've seen a pretty substantial uptick as a result, again, of the wide deployed base, and we're anticipating the same sort of thing in the first part of next year.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","And, Rami, if we look further longer term for Service Provider routing, given the pressures in that market from a secular standpoint as well as the competitive dynamics, it seems like most of you folks accuse (00:27:10) yourself, others are all talking about share gain. What's your best guess as to what the longer-term outlook from a growth perspective? Are you hoping to run in place, hoping to grow the business? Or should we just expect modest decline?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Well, I think the TAM for telco routing will be under pressure for the next couple of years, as I've mentioned, for the variety of reasons I just articulated. However, the way I look at the telco space and our opportunity in the telco space is in a couple of ways.","First, we have to be very relevant to the next-generation solutions that they're deploying, especially around virtualization and SDN; and I think we are very quickly gaining a lot of momentum there. But beyond that, I think there is an opportunity to expand in more traditional routing by penetrating accounts that are mostly international where our footprint remains very low, and there are those accounts in Europe and especially in Asia Pacific.","So, I think the combination of a go-to-market strategy that we are wrapping around that opportunity, an alliance and partnership strategy that we are putting in place to help us in expanding our reach internationally, as well as the new product portfolio that we are now introducing into the market around the PTX and the MX, I think we have a real opportunity to do that. So it's really around net new footprint, especially internationally, where we have much less penetration or market share all up is our opportunity.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess, I wanted to come back to the telco architectures a little bit, Rami. Thanks for all the clarification on where you see that; I'm curious about the 5G fixed wireless trials and then commercial rollouts that are coming up. What do you think Juniper's participation in that is and how that architecture might be changing? Do you expect the MX to be used as much there as it is elsewhere? So, that's the first question, just kind of clarifying the telco stuff.","And then, Ken, I wanted to come back to the power management parts commentary that you had and just ask \u2013 I think you referred to MLCCs (00:29:43) there; if you guys are able to source them, most people think prices are going up a lot and we don't really know how much content you guys have on average. So, I'm just curious what the margin impact of that is; is there one, or if you can source them, it's not as material for margins. Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Rod. Let me start with the question around 5G, which is a good question. First, 5G is going to be, in our view, very much a cloud-native architecture, which means that the infrastructure to support 5G services is going to be built on a distributed telco cloud. And in many ways, we're already participating in these next-generation telco cloud solutions and projects with our customers in preparation for 5G. I anticipate that will only accelerate as 5G deployments start to happen more fully and around the globe next year.","Secondarily, we've always had a strong position in Security for telcos, and in particular, mobile security; and we've seen, as you saw from our results, pretty good momentum in Security now for the third quarter in a row. That has largely come from data center and Enterprise and actually, less so from telco yet, because we haven't yet refreshed our next-generation firewalls for the high-end, and in particular, for the mobile telco opportunity. That happened this quarter, and as a result of that, we anticipate we're going to be in a fantastic position to take advantage of Security projects, in particular, to get ready for, you know, advancements to 4G or 5G.","And then, finally, it's just the transport opportunity. 5G is going to be around far more capacity that has to be transported in the Access, in the Metro, and in the Core; and we are starting to see more Metro projects that are out there that we are competing for, and our goal, again here, would be to take share. I mentioned just earlier, around our alliance and partnership strategy, we are working very closely with alliance partners with a goal of being well-prepared from a go-to-market standpoint to achieve or to compete for such opportunities as they come about.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes. And from a supply-constraints perspective, Rod, as we talked about, we do believe we will be able to mitigate the risk, but there could be some timing risk as related to lead times, et cetera. On a margin perspective, they're a very small piece of our overall cost of goods sold, so we don't anticipate any impact to our cost of goods sold or margins due to this issue.","Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to first ask about the cloud routing business. PTX has been around 80% of cloud routing for the last couple of quarters. So does it sort of stabilize here or is there a bit more to go in terms of the mix shift? And, additionally, with the cloud providers, I think you mentioned that there was a sequential slowdown in Security revenues. Is there any trend to that? Is there something particularly driving that? Or is it more of a one-off this quarter?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Samik. So, on the cloud routing side, yes, I mean, we're sort of hovering around 80% for the last couple of quarters. I do expect that when the bulk of the transition is behind us, it will actually be more than 80% that will move to PTX, but the fact that it's sort of hovering around 80% would at least suggest that we're starting to stabilize.","And the second data point that I offered is just ASPs; ASPs themselves are no longer declining as rapidly as they were just a couple of quarters ago when the transition from MX to PTX was happening far more rapidly. We've always said this transition is going to happen over several quarters. That's exactly what's happening. I think by next year, the bulk of it will be behind us, and we should start to see year-over-year growth in that timeframe.","And then your question about Security, I don't believe I said anything about Security specifically for Cloud. What I did say is, in Security, we're seeing really good momentum in the branch, in the midrange; we're seeing good Security for next-gen firewall for data center and campus. What we have not yet seen is good growth in Security is primarily because of the fact that our portfolio needs a refresh. It is due for a refresh; it's in the high end. Now, that high end for Security is primarily used for mobile applications in the telcos and some applications for large data centers, and that changes in the second half of this year as we introduce a new platform.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, in my commentary I did mention that the sequential strength in Security was Enterprise-led and it was offset partially by some Cloud from a sequential basis. It wasn't a material offset, but there was some offset. I wouldn't call it a trend; it was just timing of deployments from a Cloud Security perspective, not something that we perceive being a new trend going forward.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that clarification. So our Security business for the cloud providers has always been very lumpy because it is so concentrated in \u2013 with a few number of customers.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Got it. That's what I was referring to. Thanks for that clarification. Can I just ask, you mentioned some, sort of, pull-forward of revenues from Q3 to Q2 that's impacting the Q3 outlook here; is there any way of quantifying the pull-forward in terms of the strong close to the quarter that you had with Enterprise customers; sort of to give us a fair idea of what kind of impact on Q3 is from that?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","So the way I've looked at it is, we exceeded our \u2013 the midpoint of our guidance by approximately $30 million, and most of that was related to some better Enterprise performance than we expected going in the quarter; and we think that will have a negative impact to the Q3 Enterprise result as it gets \u2013 the sequential pattern is going to be a little more Q2-focused and a little less Q3 on the Enterprise side. But that kind of describes the magnitude that we're talking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Hey, Rami, Ken, how is it going?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Hey, Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. I have a bigger-picture question on 400 gig \u2013 I mean, congratulations on the product launch. I want to get your understanding of when is the earliest revenue quarter and then also would 400 gig mostly be incremental to you or would it cannibalize or replace any of the other footprint you have, for example, 100 gig at any of the Cloud companies? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Vijay. Good question. So, I am very excited about the 400 gig opportunity all up. I mean, Juniper has always been very strong when it comes to high-performance networking, and 400 gig, it represents the next big market opportunity for high-performance networking that's true for the wide area \u2013 it's certainly true for the data center.","There's always some level of cannibalization, right? I mean, we've seen this in the transition to 10 gig to 100 gig and to 400 gig. As customers start to adopt 400 gig, the demand for 100 gig will start to subside, but this plays out over many years. And all up, I expect it to be much more of an opportunity than anything else for Juniper. And that is, in particular, as it relates to the cloud space, the cloud provider space and especially in the switching.","So, we wanted to make sure that we introduce a holistic 400-gig strategy across our entire product portfolio. The two platforms \u2013 actually more than two, but the platforms that we introduced are just announced, that we'll introduce into the market before the end of the year, are quite honestly just teasers of what's to come that leverage next-generation merchant silicon, as well as next-generation Juniper silicon in both routing and in switching, that will provide for 400-gig readiness. As soon as the 400-gig optics are going to be available on the market, our customers will have an opportunity to deploy in use cases where that kind of capacity is required. The optics, we anticipate, will enter into the market in the Q1 timeframe, and then the build-outs will start to happen slowly throughout 2019.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, perfect. A quick follow-on for Ken on gross margins; Ken, what will get the margins to creep up? Is it just better unit volumes or are you going to apportion your COGS better? Is it \u2013 I don't know, any more offshore (00:39:00) portfolio in the mix? Just want to get your view of margins; how should we think of it heading into the second half?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, so the most immediate uptick will be primarily volume-related. Beyond that, we have a lot of value engineering efforts underway, a lot of their software \u2013 so software continues to be a bigger piece of overall revenue. That will clearly be margin positive, and you know, pricing discipline and supply chain optimization and all of these efforts will be focused on as well. But I would say that the short-term margin growth should be mostly volume. Beyond that, it's going to be primarily product innovation led with some other discipline in the supply chain.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, let me just add to that, Vijay. So, we have said that one of the contributors to gross margin pressure had been mix shift, and in particular, the shift of routing to switching. We have also, very deliberately, learned a lot from our QFX switching deployments around the world, especially with the cloud providers, and all of those lessons have now fed their way into our product innovation pipeline, especially the silicon technology that we're developing or procuring from our \u2013 for our merchant silicon vendors, to capture the next wave of switching, especially data center opportunity.","So that's what Ken means when he talks about innovation. You can't \u2013 that won't help immediately, but I'm confident that the lessons learned and the changes that we've made in our next-generation products will help quite a lot from a gross margin standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you for the question. I wanted to take a moment to just discuss Contrail and multi-cloud deployments. When customers use Contrail to deploy in to multiple clouds, are they also opting into your hardware products? And if so, like, what are they using? What I'm really trying to get at are, what are the hardware components of choice for this type of deployment?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay. It's a great question. Let me start. First, the primary use cases for Contrail have thus far been for NFV-type deployments inside of telcos and really large enterprises that almost behave like service providers. And those deployments, they take quite a bit of time to get them stood up, to get the services up and running and so forth; and that has been the primary driver of our Contrail business to date. And we've seen great momentum, not necessarily from a revenue as a percentage of total Juniper revenue, but from the standpoint of mindshare with our customers from the standpoint of pull-through of hardware like switching, routing and security. And all the strategic conversations we're having with telcos around that, the distributed telco cloud opportunity starts with Contrail.","So, what we have done recently is, we've announced a product that is based on Contrail that's called Contrail Enterprise Multicloud; just recently announced it and it actually gets shipped into the market within the next few weeks. And what that does is that it broadens the opportunity for Contrail substantially, and especially in the Enterprise space. Every CIO \u2013 or most CIOs I talk to on an ongoing basis, is in some way, shape, or form, thinking about how to move to a multi-cloud environment that includes some combination of private cloud and a variety of public cloud. But they're looking for solutions to do that with simplicity and with security. And we believe firmly that Contrail Enterprise Multicloud is the best solution for that problem.","And yes, there's absolutely a pull-through opportunity there because once you have that strategic control point within the Enterprise, the conversation shifts to the switching infrastructure for the private cloud, security, both physical and virtual, in the private cloud and public cloud, as well as potentially even routing to connect private to public cloud. So that is the strategy that we're embarking on. I'm super-excited about the products we're going to be introducing into the market just very shortly. The initial interest and the proof of concepts we've been doing with our customers has been very encouraging.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thank you for the color on that. And then maybe just to touch on the comment you just made regarding the security enablement side, when they go into public clouds or multiple public clouds is, should we expect the attach rate of your Security business to pick up in this transition versus like the legacy business? Or how could you \u2013 I'm just trying to quantify this or even think about how this would work from an attach rate perspective. Just, maybe if you give us like a point of reference.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Well, it is a very good question, and we certainly do think of it in that way. I look at Security on a couple of different horizons. There's the here-and-now around physical firewalls, and that's where we're mostly seeing the momentum we've seen over the last three quarters or so. And there's been a tremendous amount of work in making our product portfolio in the firewall space more competitive, as well as some real intense focus in go-to market that has led to that momentum.","The second horizon of security is not so much about the physical perimeter, which essentially becomes less relevant over time. It really becomes around securing workloads, applications in a private and public cloud, and that now becomes a great opportunity for our virtual security products. Our virtual SRX, our containerized SRX, which work seamlessly with Contrail's Enterprise Multicloud to offer that multi-cloud solution. At some point, I think we can talk to you about quantifying the pull-through. We're not prepared to do that now. I think maybe we can do that at the Analyst Event that we'll host in the second half of this year.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thank you so much for the color.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","My pleasure.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Notter, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hi, there. Thanks a lot, guys. Hey, I wanted to ask, going back to the mixture of PTX among Cloud Routing business, I think you said 80%, and it's been there a couple of quarters. You said it's going to continue to drift up above 80%. I guess, I'm wondering how you think about the timing for that. Do you say that because you have specific visibility into some cloud customers migrating off of MX and onto the PTX? Or is that more just a hunch you have? And I guess, I'm wondering what the timing of that would look like. Is that something that's baked into your guidance for the second half of the year in terms of revenue and margins? Thanks a lot.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes. George, no, it's based on more than a hunch; I would say it is based on an understanding that the design wins that we have with some of our really large cloud providers include a combination of PTX and next-generation QFX switching, and we're still early innings. The new architectures are sort of \u2013 we are completing, as I mentioned, the certification process; we're ready for deployment. It really now comes down to when the deployments happen holistically, internationally, which is difficult to predict on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but I have high degree of confidence that we're on the receiving end of the build-out. And that's what leads me to believe that over time, the PTX percentage will drift up.","It will never be 100% because even within the cloud space, there will be a variety of use cases where the MX is the only platform \u2013 or the platform that makes the most sense for those specific use cases, but I do anticipate it drifting up from 80% of it.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, and we think it will take you several more quarters. The transition will happen for a couple of years.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","It's a couple of years, but enough of the transition...","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Is behind us.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","...will be behind us, we believe, by the end of this year; so that by the next year, year-over-year growth in Cloud becomes very possible.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","All right. Super. Thank you very much.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Kisner, Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","James Kisner - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thank you for taking my questions. So, a little different tack here; so, obviously, the current situation, you know, with tariffs imposed by the U.S. and other countries is dynamic and changing, and recognizing you guys are fortunate enough not to be doing a lot of business in China, I'm just wondering, can you comment on any impact you've seen thus far on your supply chain, input costs, customer demand to the extent you've seen so far? How are you thinking about the risks or opportunities to your business going forward amidst the ongoing kind of the trade situation? Thanks.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, so at this point, the tariffs that have been implemented have had basically no impacts to our business. Clearly, we're monitoring the situation closely. If there are additional tariffs, they could be impactful. We are looking at ways to mitigate potential impacts of potential new tariffs, but at this point, there is nothing factored into our \u2013 obviously, our results or our Q3 guidance, because we don't expect there to be a material impact right now, but we will continue to monitor and adapt as necessary going forward.","James Kisner - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And just separately, you talked about a lot of innovation in your portfolio coming down the pike here; do you anticipate any potential wait-for effect or Osborne effect as they call it? Have you factored that at all into your business? Any thoughts there at all? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","I'm not concerned about that because a lot of the innovations that we've announced have been really around 400-gig optimized platforms in routing and in switching. I think we intentionally wanted to capture that opportunity in the very early phases, but from a demand standpoint, it will happen over time. So, I'm not too concerned about cannibalization or Osborning.","James Kisner - Loop Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Faucette, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I just had two quick questions; Ken, if you said it, I apologize and I missed it, but can you help us quantify a little bit the impact of ASC 606 on the Q3 margins and revenue, et cetera?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","On Q2, I presume, you mean? Or on Q3?","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","On Q3, going forward. Was it impacting your \u2013 the formulation of your guidance at all?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, no. So the guidance was all based on new ASC 606 rules. To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not doing a forecast under the old rules. We have converted the company to the new rules and that's what the guidance is based off of. Any given quarter, there could be a small impact. Q2, the net impact was about $17 million. I would consider that a small impact. There's potential for that to go the other direction in Q3 or go to a similar direction. So we are really pivoting the business under new rules and that's what the guidance is based off of.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And then, I guess, maybe a broader question, Rami, on Security. Obviously, the way that you've talked about it in terms of the changing dynamic and approach of Security, I'm just wondering, is that also changing your sales motion and are you having to engage with different people, or are the networking leaders becoming more involved in security decision-making yet in your sales process? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question. So, certainly, you can't see this kind of momentum with just product innovation alone. We have upped our focus in go-to market. We have built a specialist team that focuses entirely on Security and talks to the Security buyers within our customers. We've created incentives out in the field around Security and then, finally, I think the thing that's working really well for us is solution sales.","As we go to our customers and talk about a next-generation cloud architecture, I think we have now learned to talk not just about the switching component of that cloud, but it's really around switching, it's around security, it's around orchestration, multi-cloud, routing, and I think that end-to-end solutions motion has really helped us. When we look at where we are selling security, we're actually \u2013 you'll see a high degree of correlation to accounts where we're also selling other products as well.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","My pleasure.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Fish, Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Most of my questions have been answered. The only thing that really hasn't come up today is just your general competition from essentially white box switching. Just curious on your view through the second quarter.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, James. So I would say, not much has changed from our perspective. I think the real benefits for white box that our customers truly care about are flexibility, you know, having the access to different silicon choices, programmability through standards-based interfaces and telemetry, the ability to extract lots of information, and of course, economics; and I truly believe we are ahead of the market in all of these dimensions. We have a CTO, Bikash Koley, that comes from the cloud world that's infusing this kind of thinking throughout our entire company, especially our R&D organization. I think we're innovating on the right side of change for this opportunity right now for us, so more of the same.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then, Ken, maybe for you, on that 9% impact to Service from ASC 606, was that bookings or is that revenue?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Those are revenues. So the Services numbers were all revenue-based. Bookings would have no impact from the ASC 606 to ASC 605 \u2013 ASC 605 to ASC 606 perspective.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers, Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Quatrochi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. This is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. I just had a quick question, a follow-up on your MX refresh next year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the opportunity; how large of an opportunity do you see that? And then, how do you think about the timing from when that's launched to when we could start to see that impact the model?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question, Joe. First, in terms of the refresh itself, it's pretty broad-based. It has a number of different dimensions. First and foremost, we're introducing the MX technology both on the hardware and software side to our universal chassis, which is a chassis that supports all different types of use cases and deployments across switching, routing and services delivery. And then we're going to follow that up pretty quickly, in the first part of next year, with new silicone advancements for all of our MX platforms, and there are many deployed out there and a lot of empty slots that we can go and leverage.","The biggest opportunity is going to be within the telco space, right? And we have seen this time and time again. I think since the initial introduction of the MX, we probably released around three or four different major iterations of technology, and in each case, we've seen the uptake happen faster as a result of the broader deployed platform that is out there. We're equally optimistic about the opportunity here, specifically in the telco space. In terms of timing, if we introduce it in the first part of next year, typically the certification time will take six months to nine months, that sort of timeframe; some customers that will move faster, but on average, that's the kind of ballpark we'd look at for certification time.","Joe Quatrochi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","My pleasure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dmitry Netis, William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you, and thanks for squeezing me in here at the end of the call. I just sort of want to follow-up on this MX to PTX transition, and how this may potentially affect the telco segment. I understand there's an MX refresh coming, but your Cloud now is at, say, 80% transition to PTX. Is there a similar dynamic in telcos? And I know a bunch of your telcos are buying PTX. So, as you kind of look out the next three, five years, what percentage of telco customers do you expect to transition over to PTX versus MX? If there's number there, I would love to hear about that.","And is there something in that transition that kind of sucks a lot of this intelligence into the Contrail SDN controller which allows you to \u2013 which allows your customers to potentially to use maybe a less of an intelligent box at the telco level; so in other words, using PTX rather than MX.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question, Dmitry. So first, I think it's useful to understand that in the cloud provider space, most of the routing applications are primarily around transport. It's not so much about service delivery, it's around connecting data centers together, it's around connecting to peering points in their network; and that's conducive to a real optimized transport product like the PTX.","In the telco space, the use cases, there are certainly use cases that are around transport. I mean, Core is mostly around transport and for that reason, we have been selling PTXs there. But if you look over the last few quarters at the mix of MX to PTX within telco, it has not changed all that much. It's more or less stable at a number that's far less than the ratio that's in the cloud. Could the PTX inch up over time? Yes, I think it could, but it will happen at nowhere near the pace it is happening within the telco space. And it's primarily, again, because of the use cases and the services that are delivered.","In the telco space, the delineation between transport, movement of packets and service delivery to enterprises or to consumers are \u2013 is usually very fuzzy, which makes it very, very conducive to sell a very flexible platform into that opportunity. It's why the MX has been so successful and why I think the refresh we're going to do for the MX is going to see a lot of success in the telco space. So, again, I do not believe that this transition is going to happen nearly as fast in the telco space over time. I think, maybe, again, at the analyst event, we can provide you some more color on our ratio expectations over time. I don't want to do that on this call right now.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. I was going to follow up with that. But thank you, I appreciate the detailed explanation. It's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Dmitry.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session.

Despite a challenging start to the year, we delivered both revenue and earnings per share growth on a year-on-year basis. The macro volatility we saw in the beginning of the year resulted in customers taking a cautious approach in the enterprise. In addition, we experienced unanticipated delays in certain service provider deployments which impacted revenue in the quarter.","As we enter the June quarter, we are encouraged by improved visibility with respect to the timing of these deployments as well as some early and important design wins with our new products. We remain constructive on the full-year 2016 and intend to continue to make progress towards our long-term financial model.","Let's turn now to some highlights of the business. We continued to execute our strategy with significant advancements in performance and automation across a number of key solution areas. First, with the introduction of our QFX10008 spine switch, which became generally available last quarter, customers can now enjoy the most complete and compelling solution for the cloud we've ever had. Our cloud solution now includes best-in-class switching products across all layers of the data center, the most flexible data center edge routing product, our industry-leading MX Universal Edge Router, the industry's highest performance data center perimeter security solution, our high-end SRX, and increasingly essential network orchestration software, our Contrail SDN Controller, which once again was just voted by the OpenStack community as the most widely-used commercially-available controller in the world for the third consecutive time.","Second, our solutions for wide-area IP transport across data center interconnect, metro, and core is now unparalleled, with the introduction of our newest PTX line card coupled with our multilayer optimization controller, NorthStar, which we expect to soon combine with optical technology and talent from BTI Systems. We are innovating across layers of IP and optical, much of it via software, and in so doing, we expect to create new levels of network efficiency and operational simplicity for our customers. This is our strength, and leverages our heritage in a way that is highly aligned with how we believe networks will evolve over time.","We also introduced Juniper's Software-Defined Secure Network that leverages our recently (4:44) shipping security products like Sky Advanced Threat Prevention, an innovative cloud-based day zero anti-malware ATP solution, and our refreshed, branch focused, and mid-range SRX platform. Unlike the current status quo, it is a unique approach in the industry that embraces the principles of SDN and leverages the full capabilities of the entire network for threat detection and enforcement.","To complement our solutions portfolio, we also solidified several new partnerships, including a global strategic partnership with Lenovo to build next-generation converged data center solutions for enterprise and web-scale customers. We also expanded our global alliances with NEC and Amdocs to deliver NFV-based solutions that allow service providers and enterprises to gain greater service agility through automation. We look forward to sharing more about our important partnerships and go-to-market strategy with you at our upcoming Investor Day in New York.","Now, let me touch on the performance for the first quarter of each of the three elements of our business \u2013 security, routing, and switching. In security, we had a tough quarter. In addition to general weakness in enterprise and telecom, we are also now in the midst of several product transitions that affected demand of some of our older SRX security products. In Q1, we delivered several new security solutions including enhanced SRX products targeting the distributed enterprise, a vastly enhanced version of our Security Director management software, and Sky Advanced Threat Prevention.","I have said before that as we grow this area of our business, we expect it to take time and be a bit bumpy along the way. But I feel good about the long-term roadmap we're executing on and the confidence that we are building with our customers and partners. Security remains an important part of the solutions we sell to our customers, who depend on Juniper to make the successful transition to the cloud.","In routing, we saw solid growth from our cloud customers as they continue to build out their networks to cope with significant IP traffic growth. Our PTX ExpressPlus products, which began shipping late last quarter, are already seeing strong interest from a number of customers, including several going through beta cycles as well as several important design wins.","I'm pleased with our performance in switching, where we saw year-over-year revenue growth driven by the cloud data center use case, which continues to be a key focus area for us. We believe that we have a good pipeline for the QFX10000 switches, including the newest QFX10008 spine switch, which has already achieved design wins with a number of telecom and cloud provider customers.","There is no shortage of change occurring in this competitive landscape that we're in. While industry trends will continue to evolve, we believe our strategy will guide us in successfully navigating challenges and doing what is right for our customers. I remain very excited by all the new opportunities our investments in technology innovations are making possible.","As I look ahead in 2016 and beyond, I believe that Juniper is well positioned to create value for our shareholders on a consistent and sustained basis. I want to sincerely thank our shareholders for their confidence, our customers for their trust and loyalty, and our employees for their dedication and continuous improvement efforts.","Now, I'll turn it over to Ken.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be here today with all of you. I look forward to meeting with many of you in the upcoming days and weeks.","The March quarter was challenging from a revenue perspective. Enterprise revenues were impacted by cautious customer buying patterns due to macroeconomic factors, and to a lesser extent, greater than anticipated weakness due to product transitions in the campus and branch security. Service provider revenues were impacted by the timing of deployments related to certain U.S. and EMEA Tier-1 telecoms. Despite some of the challenges this quarter, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth, led by increases in the Americas, primarily driven by cloud and cable providers as well as growth in our government vertical across all geographies.","Our revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure resulted in expanded non-GAAP operating margin and a $0.05 increase to diluted earnings per share on a year-over-year basis.","In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were telecoms, four were cloud or cable providers, and one was an enterprise. Of these customers, three were located outside of the United States. This reflects our continued focus on diversifying our customer base.","Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter, with a product book-to-bill greater than 1 and a modest increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially. As we disclosed in the Q4 2015 CFO commentary, we went live with our ERP system on January 18. Overall, we believe the implementation has gone well. However, order processing and shipment linearity were affected in the quarter as we ramped up on the new system. This system change resulted in invoicing occurring later in the quarter than customary, which increased DSO by approximately 15 days. We anticipate DSO to return to our target range of 45 days to 55 days in Q2 2016. As is typical with ERP implementations of this magnitude, the stabilization of the new processes and system will take several months. We are confident that the system implementation will result in productivity improvements and efficiencies as we move forward.","In the quarter we had cash flow from operations of $172 million, down $47 million year-over-year and up $55 million sequentially. We repurchased $75 million worth of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of the share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.75 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.","Now, moving on to our Q2 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. Our guidance includes the contribution from our acquisition of BTI Systems which closed April 1, 2016. We expect BTI to contribute approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue and approximately $10 million of operating expenses in the second quarter. For the year, we expect the operations of BTI to be neutral to the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. We plan to integrate BTI into our business and do not intend to breakout financial details going forward.","From a demand perspective, we expect an improvement in deployments from certain U.S. and EMEA Tier-1 telecoms. We also expect enterprise demand to improve modestly versus Q1 levels. The outlook factors in that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. For the full year, we are focused on driving long-term shareholder value and remain constructive on revenue growth for 2016. We will continue to prudently manage operating expenses and expect to expand operating margins in 2016. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.","From a personal perspective, I'm very excited to work with Rami and the team as Juniper's CFO. I can tell you that I'm personally committed to the 2016 operating principles we outlined last quarter, of driving revenue growth in our target markets, diligently managing operating expenses and expanding operating margins, and maintaining a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure. I look forward to further discussing our long-term financial strategy and outlook with you at our upcoming Investor Day.","And now, with that, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. The first question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to first ask about operating margins. You're guiding them down to about 22% in the June quarter, but then up for the full year relative to last year which would imply a pretty significant improvement in the second half. So if you can just address that.","And then secondarily, I wanted to clarify the revenue outlook for the year. When you say you're constructive, does that mean that you're guiding for a revenue increase? And also that seems a little bit more a positive language versus that in the pre-announcement. So just curious if some of the recent design wins you were referencing has contributed to that improved optimism.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Simona. Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ken for additional commentary. A couple of factors that are at play here. As we get into the second quarter, our visibility and our confidence is certainly better now than it was just a few weeks ago in the Q1, just in terms of the timing of some of the deployments that we referred to that we expected to hit in the Q1 timeframe to have it now move to Q2 from a telco standpoint. And also, just confidence levels associated with the enterprise business is all up. It was a slow start to the year. We started to see a recovery throughout Q1, but it really hit near the very end of the quarter. So that gives us a bit more confidence going into the Q2 timeframe.","And, yes, we are looking at and expecting revenue increasing for the full-year 2016. That of course means that we should have a good second half of the year, and we based that just based on the discussions we're having with our customers, timing of projects. And then importantly, we're anticipating, as we've said in the past, that our new products which are now in the market are going through proof of concepts, we're competing in certain opportunities around the world, are going to start to ramp in the second half of the year.","And I'll let Ken comment more on the OpEx side in particular.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so from an OpEx perspective, the guidance of $500 million, plus or minus $5 million, is essentially flat to this quarter with the exception of adding $10 million for the BTI acquisition, so we're really maintaining a flat OpEx Q-on-Q, whereas the revenue was up 8% or over 8% at the midpoint, which is why the operating margins expand in Q-on-Q.","From a year-on-year perspective it is slightly down at the midpoint compared to last year, however last year's seasonality was a bit atypical. This year, we expect the seasonality to be more in line with historical seasonality patterns and we expect our margin to grow as revenue grows throughout the year.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Simona. Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. I just wanted to first follow up on Simona's question and just hopefully understand as we look out towards the second half of the year, to what extent operating margin will be driven by better growth or should we expect some additional cost savings there as we get beyond Q2.","And then I was hoping perhaps for Rami, you could update us on the timing of the QFX10016, provide some additional details regarding the pipeline you're seeing develop for the QFX10008 and what's giving you confidence these platforms are likely to win against some of the competitive platforms in the market and why customers are picking the QFX over the alternatives. Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Jess. Let me start with the second question first, and then certainly Ken and I can address the first one. The QFX product line, we introduced the first version last year, the second version, which is the 2008 (sic) [QFX10008], just this last \u2013 this quarter. And we're in the process now of essentially competing for various different opportunities. The one thing that I can say is the opportunities that we are now competing in are opportunities that we never were able to compete with or even engage with our competitors on for various customers around the world. So the first positive thing is we're expanding our opportunity, and that's very evidenced and is very clear.","Second certainly our customers have had these products in their labs now for several months, even before they started becoming generally available. And we've been getting feedback through betas and we're integrating that feedback in making sure that the product is ready for general deployability. And then last, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are some wins to speak of here that would give us confidence. So I think the products, even if you compare them to what is a changing competitive landscape, are very competitive both from the standpoint of scale and performance but also just in terms of the full capability of Layer 2 and Layer 3 that we've integrated into those switches.","Your question around the timing of the QFX10016, it's in the second half of this year, is when we anticipate it. So we're already bidding it in certain RFPs that require that sort of density. And certainly the effort and the work that we've put into the QFX10008 will go towards the work that's remaining in the QFX10016. So I feel good about the product all up.","And then your question around our operating margin and how much it depends on revenue, I'll just let Ken address that.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so our constructive view on operating margin expansion, it does start with our view on the revenue for the full year. So that's clearly a key attribute to our operating margin expansion, and Rami mentioned some of the reasons why we have that constructive view.","In addition to that, we're still seeing the benefit from some of the restructurings we've been going through for the last couple of years. We're going to continue to manage OpEx very prudently, particularly when revenue is under pressure. So you could count on us to continuing to do that.","I also should note that over the past couple of years, we have increased the proportion of variable costs as a component to our operating expenses, so that's also an additional lever that we have to help us manage operating margins as we go forward. We will continue to drive towards our long-term model of 39% of OpEx as a percentage of revenue.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Should we be thinking about OpEx flattish in the second half versus the first half? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think our commitment is to be prudently managing OpEx, and also to grow operating margins, so that's what we're going to be focused on in the second half.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks for the question. I just wanted to clarify the situation on the ERP, and then I had a bigger picture question. So you guys said that invoicing was delayed. Was it \u2013 can you just confirm it was all caught up at the end of Q1, or did some of those invoices push into Q2?","And then Ken, I think you said 15 days of DSOs, so we've got about $180 million or so of excess in the accounts receivable \u2013 just to confirm that.","And then I guess I'll ask my follow-up after you guys answer that one.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'll start with the second part. Yeah, I can confirm that is about right from a DSO perspective, so that would be additional accounts receivable as compared to what we would expect with our normal DSO targets of 45 days to 55 days. So those numbers sound right.","From an ERP implementation, we're actually proud of the fact that we went live with the new system, and it actually went quite well. We don't believe it had a meaningful impact to revenue. That said, it did have an impact to the timing of orders and shipments. So that's really why it really made the quarter back-end loaded. Q1 is typically a pretty back-end loaded quarter anyway, but with the system implementation, it became more so. And it's primarily because we were effectively down for the first two weeks or three weeks in the quarter. And as we went live with the new system on January 18, it did take some ramp-up time, not only from a system perspective, but just from a procedure and process perspective, so the growing pains and learning curve associated with that resulted in a delay as far as the timing of the orders.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then \u2013 thanks for that, Ken. And then my follow-up, the big Tier-1s that have reported so far, their CapEx has been weaker than we would have anticipated in Q1. Some telecom analysts are reducing their CapEx expectations, as seems to always happen at the beginning of the year here. I'm just curious what you guys think is happening in the U.S. from a broader point of view on those carrier budgets. Do you think they're stable? Do you think it's just a push-out of budgets further into the year as we've all gotten used to, or do you think they're actually reducing spending expectations?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Rod, this is Rami. So certainly I think it's fair to say that the telecom operators, U.S., maybe elsewhere around the world as well, are off to a fairly slow start this year in terms of their CapEx expenditures. There are a number of factors at play here, whether it's M&A or spectrum or just re-evaluating their overall network architectures and making sure that they're developing their networks to meet the future demands from an agility, from an operational simplicity standpoint, and from an ability to deliver next-generation capabilities to their end-users.","I think the most important thing for Juniper now is to make sure that we are working and engaging with telecom operators very effectively in ensuring that we remain relevant in the new architecture that they're deploying. This is where our \u2013 the combination of our switching, our routing, and our orchestration software \u2013 and namely this is Contrail \u2013 is really helping us tremendously.","So I feel good that we're engaging in a way that is going to enable us to benefit from the spend that they will end up putting into these next-generation architectures. Until then, I think they're going continue to run their networks hotter and essentially free up the capacity and the management cycles within their organizations to develop those next-gen architectures.","The other things that we must do is to continue to diversify our portfolio. We saw real strength in Q4 in the cable operators; in Q1, cloud operators. And I can tell you that the products that we're developing and we've introduced into the markets have broad applicability and have been developed with a very keen eye on the requirements of each of those strategic verticals: cable, cloud, strategic enterprises and telcos, but I think the telco space is just a little bit more complicated right now as they evolve their architectures.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Yeah, hi, Rami, Ken. A quick question and a follow-on. Your enterprise business seems to be going through large swings in revenues quarter-on-quarter. Help us understand what causes the volatility? Is it purchasing patterns? A certain segment of the enterprise market? Is it campus and brands? Data center switching? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Vijay. So you're absolutely right that enterprise is off to a weak start in 2016. I think there are a number of factors. First and foremost, there was a slow start from a macro standpoint. And as we said, it did improve, but improved only near the end of the Q1 timeframe.","It's not the only factor. I think there were product transitions that affected us as well, affected us, quite frankly, more than what we had expected. The areas where those product transitions, I think, hurt us in the Q1 timeframe were mostly in cloud where we had some transitions in our \u2013 sorry, it's not cloud. I should say campus, where we had transitions in our switching product lines, in particular, the EX. And also in security where \u2013 as you know in security, we have for the last year been executing on a new strategy. We have been delivering new products to our customers, and I feel very good about those products. But we've also taken a bit of an aggressive stance towards end-of-life-ing some of our older SRX products with the goal of ensuring that we have maximal capacity \u2013 engineering and go-to-market \u2013 to think about the newer products, the next-generation products, things like the virtual products, the cloud-based security products. And I do think that that had more of an impact than we initially expected in the Q1 timeframe.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect, and a quick follow-on, Rami, if I may, on edge routing. Your MX product is obviously a flagship here in edge routing. So we have seen early order strength from CommScope this morning, they've beaten res (26:49) numbers, macrocell densification, AWS-3 spectrum auction build-outs. Would it be reasonable to assume that edge routing would kind of naturally follow some of the wireless capacity upgrades, because traffic has to be aggregated? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't know if it's just edge routing, I would say it's routing all up. Certainly as you put more capacity into spectrum and to the air, that will ultimately see its way into fiber and will require that your routing keep pace. Now, on the routing side, we're actually seeing now very good momentum in our PTX product line, right? We saw both year-over-year as well as sequential growth in the PTX product line. And keep in mind that both the PTX and the MX are not yet fully benefiting from the enhancements that we have announced that will start to see their way into the performance of those products in a meaningful way in the second half of this year. So when I think about capacity requirements in routing, whether it's driven by cloud providers or in the telco space, or aggregation of mobile sites, or in high enterprise, I think competitively, we are very good right now. I feel very good about our competitive positioning.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Rami, just any further color on the timing of these Tier-1 U.S. and EMEA push-outs? Is it related to sort of the weaker CapEx that we saw in Q1? Or were there some other issues going on over there?","And then, quick follow up to that, MX was down sequentially. Was it all related to all these projects that got pushed out, or was there some other stuff going on with the MX?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Sanjiv. As far as timing is concerned for these telcos, I can tell you that where we are right now just in Q2, and based on our visibility of the deployments that we had anticipated in the Q1 timeframe, we were much more confident about the fact that those deployments are going happen in the Q2 and beyond sort of timeframe. And yes, I mean, the MX was essentially flat year-over-year, down sequentially, which is not atypical just based on seasonality. And the PTX, however, as I mentioned, is seeing some great momentum both year-over-year and sequentially. As far as the MX business is concerned, yeah, I would say that part of that is related to the timing of the telco spend that we had anticipated in Q1 now moving to Q2 and beyond.","Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Trevor Bacon of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Trevor Bacon - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. My question revolves around the security business. So 2015 was supposed to be the year of stabilization, and I understand there are puts and takes, but there has been a limited recovery in what is otherwise a generally attractive growth market. So what gives you the confidence that your strategy is the right one? And at what point would you consider alternatives for the business, given that it seems it will be difficult to grow this year given where we've set the bar in the first quarter? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, thanks, Trevor. So in thinking about security, it's probably useful to reflect back on 2015. We started with a refocused strategy, and we executed on new products first focusing on the service provider space, the high end of the security market where we actually saw some good momentum last year, and we certainly saw a lot of great enhancements in the product set itself.","The thing about the service provider element of our security business is that it's lumpy. And there are a couple of things that impacted us in the Q1 timeframe. First is we've got hit with a downwards part of the lump, if you will, on the SP side, where there weren't any large orders from the service provider or cloud space for those high-end customers. Again, it's a part of the business that's just difficult to predict that's going to be somewhat lumpy.","And then there were the transitions that we have to deal with in the Q1 timeframe. We have recently introduced a new set of security products for the enterprise: the SRX1500, the SRX300, and cloud-based ATP solution, an enhanced cloud management systems that I know are all hitting the mark with our customers because we're getting that feedback, but it's going to take some time to get all of the transitions worked out. You're right in stating that last year was supposedly the year of stability \u2013 we ended up actually exceeding our expectations in that timeframe.","I think where I might have gotten wrong \u2013 or what I might have gotten wrong is the timing. I think we expected some of those transition issues to happen last year. It looks like they're happening more in the first part of this year. And I feel good about the strategy all up. I feel good about the execution right now. We just have to work through these transition issues throughout this year. We're off to a slow start. So I'm not confused about the fact that there is a deficit to work through on the security side to get back to growth, but I think we were reasonably conservative enough in our long-term outlook, three-year outlook of 1% to 3% ending in the 2017 timeframe, that that is still very much achievable.","Trevor Bacon - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I wanted to I guess touch on BTI and I know it may be a little bit early, but how conversations have been going there and in that for the data center interconnect opportunity, generally. It seems like this is an important opportunity for Juniper, but also a lot of other players are trying to come into this segment, so I wanted to get your feeling for your development of the confidence there and some of the things that we should be looking for to gauge success of Juniper? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, certainly, James. So the optical opportunity is one that we have been looking at and executing towards now for a number of years. So this certainly did not start with the BTI acquisition. And we're looking at this from the standpoint of capturing inflection points in the market around the convergence of packet and optical. We're also looking at this in terms of achieving the architectures that are necessary in a way that truly simplify the overall operations to management of multilayer networks. And we're certainly focusing on the data center interconnect market and the metro market.","What BTI does is that it helps us to accelerate the strategy that we're already executing on towards being able to achieve those architectures. And I feel very good about the opportunity. I also feel good about how we're thoughtfully integrating the BTI assets into our overall portfolio. It is a growing market. It's certainly a competitive market. But I think we have a good stronghold in certain parts of the market today with our MX and PTX product that help us to very naturally capture this inflection point that's happening today.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then I guess just back on the pacing of enterprise and your confidence for the second half of the year, you talked about that there was improvement towards the end of the quarter. Can you just give a little more color as to what types of data points or behaviors that you're looking at to increase the optimism around enterprise after the tough first quarter?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ken, why don't you go ahead?","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, this is Ken. Yeah, you got it right. We did see improvement later in the quarter from a demand perspective. From our perspective, the volatility in the market has improved since the beginning of the year. We're still being cautious with the market. It's still a market that has some uncertainty, but it is less uncertain than it was in the beginning of the year. And we did see that in our demand profile. That said, being cautious, we are still modestly \u2013 expecting it to grow modestly from Q1 levels into Q2. So we are expecting an improvement quarter-on-quarter in the enterprise space.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So on these projects in the U.S., that's quite delayed, so I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color about what happened? So is that just like one project, or is that several projects? And what was the cause of the delays? I hope it wasn't because like the Juniper technology wasn't fit for purpose? So is that, like, just logistics or did you have, like, a real technological issue? And if we think about, like, a real issue, do you have better visibility now because you now know the situation is completely cleared up and it's just a question of getting the project to deliver? Or is there still a bit of an uncertainty in terms of resolving reloading issues?","And then you sound very confident about these projects coming back into as early as Q2, and I'm actually a bit surprised because when I look at your quarter-on-quarter guidance, it doesn't especially adjust for BTI. It doesn't seem to be much higher than normal seasonality between the Q1 and the Q2 actually in line with normal seasonality. So does that mean you've been prudent in your guide in other areas of the business, or is there another moving part I'm missing? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Pierre, let me start. I think the answer is fairly simple. First it's not just in the U.S., it's a number of telcos, Tier-1 in particular in the U.S. and EMEA. It is not a Juniper-specific thing in any way, and it certainly has nothing to do with fit for purpose as you mentioned in your question.","And what gives us more confidence now is that we have better visibility. And certainly, that comes from talking to our customers, understanding what the deployment time frames are going to be. And as I mentioned, just based on where we are right now in the Q2 timeframe, that visibility has improved somewhat from the last few weeks. So that's why we are more confident today.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and I would just add that the service provider business, particularly telecom, has always been lumpy and deployment based. And it is difficult to predict the precise timing of when those large deployments are going to happen.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And maybe on this question about the Q2 guide, so does that mean you had a very prudent approach, or?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We feel \u2013 we stand behind our Q2 guide. It is up over 8% at the midpoint, which is a bit beyond historical patterns. We do expect some of that telecom deployment to start to catch up into Q2 and beyond. We don't expect it to shift all just in one quarter. It will shift into Q2 and beyond Q2. We also expect a modest increase in the enterprise within that guidance increase.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead.","Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC","Hey guys, this is Tejas for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on Web 2.0 companies who were 16% of sales in 2014. Have they trended up or down since then? And then your competitors seem to be targeting the DCI routing market within hyperscalers with Jericho-based products. I was curious how should we think about the impact of those on your hyperscaler revenues? The concern of course is that you'd compress TAM even if you maintain share. Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So the cloud providers continue to be a very important and very strategic vertical for us. And I think if you look at their CapEx guidance for the full year, it looks encouraging. We remain very relevant not just in the DCI space, but in many different parts of our web-scale customers' networks. Not confused about the fact that we are going to see or we're seeing competition in this area. I mean, it's a very attractive market, and so competition is to be expected. And I would think about it from a couple of different ways. There're sort of different use cases that we go after at Juniper. There are use cases that require quite a lot of flexibility, software sophistication and so on that we capture with products like VMX. And the MX has an incredible amount of flexibility and features that are very sticky in our customer networks. And for that reason, the barriers to entry are just going to be somewhat higher.","Then there are more streamlined routing use cases and opportunities that we go after with more efficient products for pure routing or transport, like the PTX. Nothing new. This is something that we almost invented just a few years ago with the introduction of the PTX product line. And now we're enhancing the PTX product line to go out after those streamlined opportunities even more aggressively.","And last but not least, there is the introduction of our spine switches that actually opens up a brand new opportunity for us to compete in the cloud provider space. And that's exactly what we're doing. I think if you aggregate all of these opportunities together and you include the competitive pressures that will exist in the market, the opportunity for us is something that we are very excited about and we are competing effectively for.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and from a numbers perspective, I will say the last time we broke it out, it was 16% back in 2014. We're not prepared to break that out for you now, but I will tell you that it has been our fastest-growing vertical since then. So it is fair to say that it has been trending up as a percentage of our total revenue.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes. Excuse me. Thank you very much. I am hoping, Rami, that you can help us on the routing side or the service provider side of things. It sounds at one level like you are expecting super seasonal revenue growth through the balance of the year as these projects that got pushed out of the first quarter return over the balance of the year. But at another level, it does sound as though you are a little nervous about the overall demand picture from service providers, with your commentary about the networks running a little hotter as the telcos evaluate their architectures. How do we balance those two?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, thanks Jeff. I don't think actually that we would be expecting something completely out of the normal in terms of telecom spend for second half versus first half. So let me just sort of clarify that. And then, just keep in mind that as we think about the service provider opportunity, that includes telcos, it includes the cloud space, it also includes the cable space. And as I think about that opportunity all up across all of those verticals, and then weave into that our competitiveness with the introduction of new products across the MX and the PTX product lines, that is what essentially gives us the ability to be constructive on the full year.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. All right, so it's broader \u2013 it's broadening your product line \u2013 or broadening your customer base and your new products that are going to do the trick for us here.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's right. I'm not counting on anything that's out of the ordinary in terms of telco seasonality. It's certainly broader across verticals and it includes the new products with our early visibility that we have and the acceptance levels of the new products, the early design wins that we have with the new products that give us that confidence.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then Ken, I have a bit of a question for you that might not be totally fair, because it harks back to the last call. But on this call it sounds as though things were kind of bad at the beginning of the quarter and that things picked up over the course of it, partially because of ERP, but also partially because of the end-market. As I recall from the last call, it sounded as though \u2013 at the time of the last call in late-January, you hadn't actually seen stuff or your customers erode their order patterns yet, but you were taking your guidance down a little bit just to be prudent. So that would suggest that things would have gotten worse over the course of the quarter. So could you help us square that away?","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so Q1 is typically a pretty back-end loaded quarter to begin with. So at the time of the call, our visibility into actual results for the Q1 were relatively low, as we'd expect them to be given that point in the quarter and the seasonality or the linearity within the quarter, I should say. That compounded with our ERP transition that we mentioned did really nothing to help our visibility. In fact, we were system down for a few weeks in January. So it was largely as we expected early, but down. But it never came back as quickly as we thought it would. We really thought the pick up from a linearity perspective would happen mid-quarter. It really happened late-quarter. And that's really our traditional pattern, is we start slow and start picking up in the middle, and in this particular quarter, it didn't pick up quite as quickly as we thought it would.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. So all right, that's helpful. Thank you very much, Ken. And congratulations.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian White of Drexel. Please go ahead","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah, Rami, I'm wondering if you'd talk a little bit about Lenovo and this partnership. It sounds very interesting. It gives you access to a huge market over there. I know Lenovo is excited about it. Maybe just highlight what you think it means for Juniper, and when can it actually impact the top-line? And second question would be around OpenStack. Obviously there is a big OpenStack summit occurring this week out in Austin, and maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing at OpenStack and how you participate in this conference. Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, thanks for the question, Brian. Lenovo, we, too, are excited about the potential for this partnership. It's still early days in terms of doing the things that are necessary from a go-to-market and an R&D standpoint to go after the broad opportunity. It really hinges on the convergence of compute storage and networking. And as you probably know, there is a class of customer that wants a packaged solution that includes all of these elements plus the orchestration software. So a key part of our strategy with Lenovo is to develop solutions that are essentially turnkey in nature that will help our customers get to an automated data center far quicker. It is a global partnership, but certainly we expect it to help us in China, where Lenovo enjoys particular strength.","And in terms of the timing, I think this is going to take several quarters for us to do what's necessary, both in terms of the technology integration as well as the go-to-market enablement and training that needs to happen to tap into the full opportunity. And again, I am quite excited about the potential for this opportunity.","OpenStack, you're right. The conference just took place a short while ago. Juniper just as we have in the past was there in full force with a number of key speaking slots. We're very proud of the fact that our SDN Controller got voted for the third time in a row as the number one deployed SDN Controller worldwide. And we see this firsthand in terms of the telco as well as the large-scale enterprises that we're engaging in with on next-generation automated data center architectures. And we have just a fantastic team, a great product that I'm just very excited about. And in terms of OpenStack itself, and the deployments and the acceptance of OpenStack in the market, we're seeing some increasing interest in customers that want to go down the OpenStack path as opposed to other offerings that are out there.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So I'm going to focus on the OpEx side of the equation here. As we get to the back half of the year, is there potential to see operating margins exceed the numbers you put up last year?","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So for us to expand operating margin, which we're committed to doing, and given what we've guided to Q2, yes, you can expect operating margin to exceed on the second half to get to the annualized increase. We will absolutely be managing our OpEx at a lower rate than revenue from a growth perspective. And we're going to be prudent with all levers within OpEx, from headcounts, not head count, et cetera.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right, so then if I were to think about the expense line, are you essentially guiding to decrease in the S&M expense, because I would think that R&D would probably remain stable at the high-teens?","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I'm not guiding to decrease OpEx in any particular line. The op margin expansion is very, very correlated to our constructive view on revenue growth for 2016 and will be prudent with OpEx. And that will result in op margin expansion for the full year.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it, thanks. And then just one last one on the security side. I know that it was a little bit of a tough quarter in March, but when do you guys expect to see an inflection point in that business as we work through the year?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so on the security side, we're off to a slow start, as I mentioned primarily because I think there was a macro impact, but there was also the product transition impact. I think the product transitions will work their way out throughout the rest of this year. And I think that our long-term projection for security of 1% to 3% by the end of 2017 remains intact.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I just wanted to ask if you could give us color around the international landscape and what you're hearing about, I guess, growth from European operators. For example, it seems to be, you know, a bit weaker (51:12).","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Victor. So from an international standpoint, in EMEA, the main issue in Q1 was the timing of orders \u2013 or timing of deployments, I should say, in the Q1 timeframe that has moved into Q2 and beyond. There \u2013 we still have visibility into opportunities in the telco space, but also in the large enterprise and government space that I think gives us confidence for the full year in EMEA.","And in Asia Pacific, a number of things that are going on there: I think we continue to see good growth outside of China. China remains to be a more challenging environment, but sequentially over the last few quarters, I think China is starting to look more and more encouraging. We have made a number of changes to our go-to-market model, toward leadership in Asia Pacific that's starting to pay off for us. And certainly new partnerships like the one we just discussed with Lenovo are going to help us, I think, in EMEA and Asia Pacific but in particular in Asia Pacific I think we're going to see the benefit there first.","Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","When you mentioned that your visibility had improved recently, does that include the European operations? Is your visibility comment, you know, reflective of all the geographies, or was that more for the U.S., or \u2013 because it seems that \u2013 go ahead, I'm sorry.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I understand the question. And my comments about visibility were specific to the timing of revenue that we had expected in the Q1 timeframe for Tier-1 telcos. And yes, the answer is absolutely, the visibility has now improved for Q2 and beyond for that revenue we had expected in the Q1 timeframe.","Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Erik Suppiger of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","Yeah, thank you for taking my question. One of your competitors introduced a solution that's going to combine data center switching and routing based on some of the new chip sets coming out. I'm just curious, is that something that you're looking out with the new QFX, and maybe combining some of that with the MX technologies?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's a great question. And certainly the competitive dynamics in our space are evolving and very interesting. However, that said, this idea of routing and switching being combined into a common system is not a particularly new one. The MX, although we have called it a universal edge router for a very long time, has actually enjoyed many switching capabilities for many years. Our PTX product line runs the same operating system as the MX product line, and it, too, combines routing and switching in a very streamlined transport type of manner.","And our QFX product line, both the top of rack as well as the new QFX10000 that we're introducing into the market are going to enjoy not just a great switching capability, but all of the benefits of fantastic routing that comes from the fact that we have a common operating system. Our one operating system strategy in the company is really going to shine as we start to deploy cloud solutions that include switching, routing, security, and the orchestration software, where the combination of switching and routing is going to help us compete very effectively in this use case.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","So is that going to be part of the strategy, consolidating those two layers within the data center?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it depends because it very much is going to depend on the type of solution that the customer wants. In certain cases, one can think of an architecture where the edge of the data center will do nothing more than provide a transport function that connects to another data center \u2013 very simple use case. In that case, we've already been going after that opportunity with our PTX product line, and we certainly have the ability to go after that opportunity with the QFX10000 switches. But there are, not to be underestimated, many customers that require a lot of complex encapsulations and decapsulations, complex routing functions that require a great deal of flexibility right down to the hardware, that can only be captured with a class of product like the MX.","The key points here for us is we have the most complete portfolio of tools at our disposal right now between the MX, the PTX and the QFX to compete very effectively, irrespective of what the architectural approach that our customers have in mind. And that holds true for any of our competitors in the market.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, and second question, did you see any change on the competitive landscape? I understand timing \u2013 specifically I'm thinking of security. Some of the other vendors that have reported had relatively good high-end sales in the quarter. I'm just wondering did you see any emerging players or anything change on the competitive landscape in the market?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","In the high end of our security space, I think we have a very competitive product geared towards the large cloud providers that need a lot of performance at the edge of a data center as well as in the service provider space for mobile connectivity in particular, what we call the Gi-LAN firewall. I don't think that things got more competitive in the Q1 timeframe. I think the issue that we faced in Q1 timeframe were mostly the combination of macro factors (57:25) resulted in a slow start, the product transitions and the lumpiness in our large service provider business.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Erik.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations","So that is \u2013 thank you, Manny.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. Thank you. You may begin.","Jess Lubert","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","Our discussions today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Our Q3 results and forward-looking guidance are provided under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Rami. ","Rami Rahim","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported better than expected results during the September quarter. Total revenues of 1.180 million was above the midpoint of our guidance, as continued strength in our enterprise business along with better than expected service provider sales more than offset weakness within the cloud. In addition, gross margin exceeded the high end of our guidance, while operating expenses came in towards the low end of our forecast, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.54, $0.07 above the high end of our outlook.","We're seeing encouraging development in many areas of our business, which are providing confidence in our long term growth prospects. Some of these developments include the following. Our enterprise business continues to see solid momentum, rising 15% year-over-year and growing year-over-year for the seventh consecutive quarter. Strength was experienced across all technologies and we benefited from a diverse base of customers. While our enterprise switching and security business both grew year-over-year, we also saw very strong demand for our enterprise routing portfolio, as new solutions such as the MX204 and the MX10003 are seeing solid success in areas of the market where we previously didn't play. We believe we have the right products and strategy to win in the enterprise markets and we are strengthening our go to market focus on this vertical, under our new Chief Customer Officer, Pierre-Paul Allard.","Security was another bright spot in Q3, growing 8% year-over-year and rising for a fourth consecutive quarter. While our breadth of security deals was strong in the period, we were also encouraged to see an uptick in the number of transactions over $1 million. We experienced strong security booking during the September quarter and we remain optimistic, regarding the growth prospects for our security business.","While our service provider revenue declined 6% year-over-year, the business grew 4% sequentially and performed better than we expected. We believe the upside relative to our expectations reflects the strengthening of our relationships with many of our top service provider customers who recognize the value of the innovations we're bringing to market. We believe our orchestration telemetry, node slicing cups and universal chassis capabilities are leading the industry and should position us to win with our service provider customers.","We are also optimistic regarding the potential of our MX5G offerings, which we spec to begin shipping early next year. We believe customers are increasingly recognizing the value that Juniper is offering. We believe this was highlighted at our recent NXTWORK\u2019s user conference, where customer and partner attendance more than doubled year-over-year. We\u2019re excited about new and expanding partnerships with firms like Nutanix and Ericsson, which we expect to not only strengthen our ability to capitalize on multi-cloud and 5G initiatives, but also broaden our reach and drive competitive advantage versus alternative offerings.","We're also in the early stages of ramping several important new innovations, such as Contrail Enterprise Multicloud and the SPC3 line cards for our high end SRX firewall, both of which began shipping in the third quarter. These platforms bring material differentiation to the market and are already seeing strong customer traction, which should prove accretive to growth in future quarters.","Not to be overlooked, we're on the verge of introducing the industry's first 400-gig product and believe we will be well positioned to gain share, as cloud, service provider and enterprise customers look to meet surging bandwidth requirements. Our software business had another strong quarter, rising both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and accounting for nearly 10% of our revenue. While this strength was due to several one-time license buys and we do not expect our software business to remain at this level over the next few quarters, we continue to introduce new software solutions to the market and are putting go to market strategies in place in order to drive higher software attach rates in future periods.","While we remain optimistic regarding our long term prospects, we are also seeing some challenges in the market, particularly within the cloud vertical where we believe several of our customers are running their networks harder and the pace of deployments are proceeding more slowly than we previously anticipated. Based on our current forecast, we're not expecting a material improvement in cloud revenue during the December quarter, which is the primary reason the midpoint of our revenue forecast no longer embed a return to year-over-year growth in Q4.","This weakness relative to our prior forecast is mostly due to our expectations regarding the impact of cloud driving sales and to a lesser extent cloud switching revenue. Although the timing and pace of cloud deployments remains difficult to predict, we maintain a high level of engagement with these important customers and remain confident we are not only holding our cloud footprint, but also positioning to benefit as incremental capacity requirements eventually drive improved demand.","As we announced earlier in the quarter, Pierre-Paul Allard joined us as our new Chief Customer Officer. I'm excited to have him on my team and believe the changes we will make under Pierre-Paul\u2019s leadership will help further drive improved sales execution. ","In summary, while our business is lumpy and sometimes difficult to predict on a quarterly basis, we remain confident regarding our pipeline of opportunities and our ability to grow the business in 2019. Perhaps, more importantly, we are innovating in ways, which truly matter to our customers and should position the business to see improved long term success. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders.","I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.","Ken Miller","Thank you, Rami and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the third quarter were better than expected with revenue of $1.180 million, above the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin of 61.1% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 were both above our guidance range. ","Our enterprise vertical posted its seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, increasing 15%, driven by strength across all technologies. The 4% sequential decline was consistent with normal seasonality and in line with our expectations. The service provider vertical declined 6% year-over-year, but increased 4% sequentially. The sequential growth was better than expected, primarily due to strength in EMEA.","Cloud revenues declined 28% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. The declines reflect a slower than expected pace of deployments. As Rami mentioned, we remain confident in opposition with our strategic cloud customers, however, the pace of deployments is difficult to predict. During the quarter, routing saw 15% decline year-over-year, primarily due to cloud, partially offset by strength in Enterprise.","Our switching business grew 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Security posted a fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, increasing 8% and the growth was driven by strength in all verticals. Our services business declined 1% year-over-year, due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of ASC 606, services would have increased approximately 6% year-over-year.","In reviewing our top ten customers for the quarter, five were cloud, four were service provider and one was an Enterprise. Product deferred revenue declined in the third quarter, primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of ASC 606, product deferred revenue would have increased 1% year-over-year. For the quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 61.1%. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by favorable product mix, including the positive effect of higher software sales and geographic mix.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. Cash flow from operations was $207 million for the quarter, an increase of 6 million year-over-year and $37 million quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to lower tax payments. Our $750 million ASR, which was initiated in Q1 of this year concluded in the third quarter, resulting in the retirement of an additional 6 million shares in the third quarter.","We also paid $62 million in dividends in the third quarter. Our total cash, cash equivalents and investment balance at the end of September quarter was $3.6 billion, a modest increase versus last quarter. ","Before we move on to the question-and-answer part of the call, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find details in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. While we were expecting to return to year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter, the midpoint of our guidance reflects a year-over-year decline. This is due to the slower pace of expected deployments from cloud customers.","In addition, while the recently implemented China tariffs are not expected to have a material direct impact on our Q4 \u201818 financial results, customer buying behavior could be affected and gross margin may be slightly impacted. While we expect to see gross margin benefit from volume in the fourth quarter, our guidance is down sequentially due to a more normalized product and geographic mix. We expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to slightly decline on a year-over-year basis.","It's also worth noting that the higher interest rates, other income and expense is likely to be lower going forward, in line with our Q3 \u201918 results. While we expect our Q4 \u201918 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%, we believe our go forward non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 19% to 20%. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success.","Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet.","Jeff Kvaal","Yes. Thank you very much, gentlemen and two questions for me. I guess number one, could we start on your visibility on the cloud. What can you tell us about the projects and what have you in the past? You've been able to look a little bit further out there one quarter. Perhaps, you can help us understand where the PTX migration is. And when we might be able to expect an uptick?","And then secondly, if you could give us a little bit of visibility into the 400-gig cycle and what -- how you expect that to play out for you through 2019? Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Thank you, Jeff. This is Rami. I'll start with your questions. And the first one on the cloud, clearly, the timing of project build outs have been difficult to predict. I just point out that it really is tied to a very few number of cloud providers, so you only have to get it wrong for a couple of customers to get it wrong all up. Having said all that, I still maintain that we have all of the ingredients in line to get this part of our business back to growth, from a technology standpoint, talent standpoint, the engagement at the engineer level within our organization that's all working very well. So I do think 2019 all up will be a growth year for us in the cloud based on the visibility that we have, the timing of deployments.","To your question around the product set, all or most of the big product projects that we are or projects that we're working on right now that should see deployment in the coming quarters are PTX based. So I don't think that there is any difference based on what we've articulated in the past from a product standpoint. And tied to that is 400-gig. So very importantly, if you look at our cloud provider strategy all up, one element of the strategy is to ensure that we're doing everything that's necessary to maintain our footprint where we already have incumbency and of course that's a large footprint that exists among the major cloud providers. ","And to return that part of the business to growth as the capacity requirements dictates or requires more networking capacity throughout their networks. But beyond that, there is a deliberate strategy to move into new footprint, especially closer to and into the data center with our switching portfolio. And honestly based on everything that we are working on from a software standpoint, from a silicon technology standpoint as well as the 400-gig roadmap, we have a lot of confidence that we can in fact expand our footprint.","The last point I'll make around the cloud provider space, because I know it is top of mind for many of you is just that, we look closely at the health of the market from the standpoint of the health of our customers\u2019 businesses, right, the businesses of our cloud providers is thriving and we don't anticipate any major slowdown from that front and that should only maintain the requirement for them to invest in their network, so I remain optimistic about this part of our business in the future.","Jeff Kvaal","It's a little difficult for us to square the growth in those businesses with your down cloud revenues, Rami and I think that's what has us scratching our heads a little.","Rami Rahim","I totally understand that, but it's actually not that confusing when you think about it, because the major element of the revenue shortfall is the product transition. We\u2019re moving from a product that has a certain price per port to a different product that has a lower and substantially we\u2019ve been open with you about this, they\u2019re substantially lower price per port. We did this deliberately to avoid a scenario where we find that we will lose footprint, if we don't. So we are, in effect, disrupting ourselves to make it much more difficult for anybody else to come in and to disrupt us.","So while, yes, it will be painful and dilutive to revenue in the short term, I think it's exactly the thing that we must do today to preserve that footprint and to get back to growth in the coming quarters. So I think that's the biggest element of the downturn in revenue that you're seeing today.","Ken Miller","And the only thing I would add, this is Ken, is that our actual port count has grown here to date FY18 as compared to this point last year. So we are seeing growth and volume growth in port count and we're also seeing stabilization in pricing per port. So, as we continue to see growth, we will start to see revenue come back to growth as well as our expectation.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank.","Vijay Bhagavath","Two questions if I may quickly, Rami and Ken. The first is the delays in the cloud customers. How did that get you caught by surprise, because the delays or the slowdowns were generally known? And then the second part of the question is, the 5G cycle is starting to crank up here with Verizon in particular, when would you see kind of any order uptake in the routing business, as 5G broadband starts getting commercially deployed? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Thank you, Vijay. Again, I want to sort of emphasize the fact that the timing of projects within the major cloud providers is really tied to a very few number of customers. And so if you get it wrong for just those customers, then obviously that puts challenges all up. Now, the guidance that we provided for Q4 is not that different than what it had was originally, so I don't think that there is a massive change in our outlook, relative to where we were just a quarter ago.","And again, I want to emphasize the fact that I think we're doing everything necessary across the board to ensure that we are there to take advantage of the build outs when they occur and I do believe that they will occur based on our very tight engagement and conversations that we're having with our cloud customers.","Second is your question about 5G. I'm very excited about the opportunity that 5G presents. I think the only question mark around 5G is really around the timing of those opportunities. Yes. I think you're starting to see some news and some very early deployments for 5G and in particular in the rand space, but we're gearing up across the board with our technology, so the MX5G capabilities that come in to the market in the Q1 timeframe with a feature set, it's really honed towards 5G option. ","Our partnerships with companies like Ericsson that I think helps us in relevance in penetration, in accounts where our customers are clearly thinking about their 5G roadmaps and then last but not least is the fact that most of the 5G deployments are really going to be cloud native in nature and we're seeing a really solid win rate right now in our telco cloud solution that includes Contrail as an SDN controller as well as the underlying switching, routing and security infrastructure to support that telco cloud architecture and this is being done -- basically rolled out by our customers in anticipation of 5G. ","So we're not waiting until 5G becomes a big spend cycle before we start to take advantage of the opportunities that are out there.","Operator","Our next question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.","Victor Chiu","This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I know you said that the tariffs weren't expected to be -- to have too much of a material impact in the fourth quarter, but can you tell us -- can you help us understand what\u2019s the expected effect of the tariffs, assuming the step up to 25% in January.","Ken Miller","Sure. So, this is Ken. So, clearly, we're watching it closely and we're not -- our position is not unique here. All of us are watching intently. Our strategy is to mitigate the impact of tariffs as much as we can. We have a global footprint. We do manufacture in multiple places, including China. There will be an impact. We were not able to mitigate and our current strategy is to pass an impact along to our customers and partners in the form of an import tax charge. Presuming we're successful in doing that would be largely profit neutral gross margin, sorry gross profit neutral, but it does have the potential to have a negative impact to gross margin as we move forward. Clearly, as we move to 25% or the potential to go to 25% would have a much more significant impact than the current tariffs. We're watching closely and we'll look to mitigate as we can going forward.","Victor Chiu","Do you have a sense of how successful you may be in passing those or having customers absorb the increases?","Ken Miller","Yeah. It's early days right now, but at this point, we feel pretty good about our position with the Q4 tariff in place and our ability to not only mitigate, but also pass along a relatively small increase to our customers.","Victor Chiu","And given that this is an impact that\u2019s kind of across the board, are there competitive implications here for Juniper or.","Ken Miller","We're watching the industry close. Clearly, in our case, it is important to note that all products are impacted, right. We do have many products that are not impacted. So mix is going to also matter as a result \u2013 as the impact of the tariff to the P&L, looking to optimize our footprint to put more in the non-tariff locations is something we're looking at very closely as well and we will continue to remain competitive in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company.","Paul Silverstein","A couple of clarifications and a question. And the clarification is, Ken, I think I heard you say pretty clearly that pricing normalized on a year-over-year basis, on a like-for-like per port basis. I just want to confirm that. I recognize you had a big reset with the cloud situation, but is pricing now is ready to kind of normalize? And --","Ken Miller","Yes. I'll just jump in. Yes. That is correct.","Paul Silverstein","And I assume, you're trying to exposure to just both direct and indirect with the indirect piece being by virtue of suppliers that it is just contract manufacturers or purchase components and their self-assemblies and I assume before we\u2019re going through that quantification, I'm hoping you give us some sense for what both the direct and the indirect exposure is and then the real question, from a competitive landscape standpoint, with the understand that revenues are backward looking, so I'm asking I'm looking out into the future, are you seeing any impact at this point from Cisco or Nokia, which both have introduced new platforms relatively recently, Arista, which has come in to the market as well with their own routing stacks, are you seeing them impact either your win rate in terms of new projects that haven't shown up in revenue yet and\/or pricing.","Rami Rahim","Let me take the competitive question. I -- honestly I haven't been this confident and optimistic about our technology roadmap ever at Juniper. If I look across the board from our switching portfolio, our routing portfolio and our security portfolio, I look at the underlying technology elements from a silicon development standpoint, our silicon photonics efforts, our operating system developments that we are making on, on an ongoing basis. And then the systems that we're introducing into the market just over the next year that are going to be 400-gig capable that are going to have operating system capabilities that are absolutely aligned with the direction of the market, I think we are going to be extremely competitive and I think we're also adding to that new layers of innovation in particular around the enterprise where our Contrail Enterprise Multicloud solution is really resonating with many of our enterprise customers that are looking to move to Multicloud solutions that I think is giving us a real leg up right now in the marketplace. So if anything, my expectation is that as we continue to introduce these systems, the software capabilities, our win rate will only increase going into next year.","Paul Silverstein","Rami, do you think you can convert, there's obviously been secular issues on top of the competitive landscape in these service provider routing markets, do you think that can return to growth, are you going to have the benefit of using comps that are getting into, again, I understand there are secular challenges, but is it your internal expectation that that will return to growth or at least stabilize.","Rami Rahim","So, in our November Analyst Day, we'll provide you with a longer term outlook for our business across each of our key market verticals. In the SP space, what I'll tell you for now is we're not going to model into our outlook a return to growth next year. We're going to be prudent and careful in our expectation for this SP-based, primarily because of the secular issues that you're talking about. ","Having said that, there are a number of opportunities that are out there, that we are out to capture. These are net new footprint type opportunity for us in the demand of telco cloud in preparation for 5G deployments. In the cable space, remote fi type architectural solutions, metro build outs in anticipation of increased capacity requirements for 5G deployments, all of these are examples of net new opportunities that we're going after.","The last one I will mention that we're actually already seeing really meaningful progress in is in our smaller form factor MX solutions that 204 and the 10003 that are already bringing us into footprints and new tier 2 type service providers that we never had a shot at in the past. So, there's a lot from a opportunity standpoint that I'm optimistic about, but I'm -- I also just want to be cautious because of the all up secular issues in our outlook for next year.","Ken Miller","Yeah. And on the tariff front, I'm not going to break out the direct versus indirect. I will tell you that the majority of our exposure is on the direct side. Just to give you some numbers, I mean, for the balance of this year, we expect the import tax charge to be 3.5% of the net invoice for those impacted skews. So again not all skews are impacted, but for those impacted skews selling into the US from China, there will be an uplift on invoice of 3.5%. At that level, it should have a negative impact to gross margin of about 20 to 30 basis points, but it should be relatively profit neutral and clearly the exposure would go up, if the tariff did increase next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron","Let's talk about some of the things that work like enterprise and security. Maybe you could talk about, Rami, about the pipeline activity. I guess the one thing that people will be concerned about that is finally the time when cloud recovers, those things start slowing down. So help me think about the business momentum that you have there, how does the pipeline look like and how do you separate just the general strong spending environment from your performance, how do you tell how much of it is just all lifted versus you're delivering something that others do not.","Rami Rahim","So I'm honestly very pleased with our performance in the enterprise space all up and in security. There is definitely a robust spending environment in the enterprise globally that we're taking advantage of, but we're now seeing seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in the enterprise, the last quarter in Q3, 15% year-over-year. So I think that this is a emotion that's really working for us, a focus area that I'm quite optimistic about.","To double click on it, we're seeing strength in customers that truly value and view their networks as mission critical to their businesses. So in the federal space, financial services, large banks, the momentum there is very strong. We're delivering solutions that are very meaningful for the direction of travel of many of the CIOs within those customers. Everybody today is thinking about how to move a Multicloud architecture.","Few have the tools and the capabilities to do it. So in our view, this is an unsolved problem that is ripe for us to jump in and to help them solve it and our enterprise Multicloud solutions are doing just that. We have gotten third party validation from analyst firms like Gartner and Forrester recently about our data center networking technology and software defined networking capabilities that our enterprise customers pay very close attention to.","And then of course, there is the sales motion. There is some solid sales execution that is happening in the enterprise due to a focus on going after net new logos and I expect that to only improve with the sales leadership changes that we have made in the company, primarily with the welcoming of Pierre-Paul to the company.","So when I \u2013 and may be the last point on the enterprise, the enterprise routing, it's not just about switching and security, enterprise routing with our newer products or newer innovations like the 204 to 10003 are really working for us and enabling us to capture new footprint that we have not done in the past. So I expect that momentum to continue because bookings are solid, the engagement level is great and the execution all up I believe will only improve from here.","Now going into security, in the security space, we had mentioned in last quarter that we had refreshed practically our entire product line with the exception of the high end, which was due for a refresh and that refresh happened in the Q3 timeframe with the third generation of our SBC line card for our high end firewall and as expected, the uptake and the pipeline built immediately again in a number of different customer verticals, in particular, in the banking sector, where that kind of security performance is just mandatory and honestly, they can't get from anybody else out there.","And so we benefited from that in Q3, not just from a revenue standpoint, but from a booking standpoint, which will help us in future quarters. So both from an enterprise and security standpoint, I'm quite optimistic looking forward.","Ken Miller","Yeah. The only thing I would add is just the breadth of the string. So for security, it was -- all verticals were up, both service provider cloud and enterprise. For enterprise, all technologies were up, routing, switching and security, so that breadth is very encouraging. I would also add that for both enterprise and security, our number of million dollar customers were up in the quarter. So we\u2019re seeing it kind of a broad based growth across the board for those two parts of our business.","Operator","Our next question is form Tal Liani from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani","Hi. I'm trying to go back to the cloud question, and I'm trying to understand two things. First going into this quarter, we started hearing that few big cloud vendors, hyperscalers are reducing spending, because they started the year very, very strong with spending, and it's concentrated, but if you aggregate the numbers are so big, if you aggregate, you still see a decline in second half versus first half. So that's one driver, which is weak spending possibly.","The second driver is that you've been working on architectural changes at some of your biggest customers, and the PTX was entering this quarter, the migration was 80% done, you said it in the past. And also at the switching level, the migration was happening, and I'm trying to understand what's the source for the weakness in cloud, is it because there is no spending and there is pressure on spending by cloud vendors, or is it because some of the components of your technology changes, some of this is not working according to the timetable that we expected or so is it technology or is it spending? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Thanks for the question, Tal. So I'll answer it in reverse order. I don't think it's a technology issue. The PTX, the product that we build, the technology, the feature capabilities were all developed exactly to capture the future cloud opportunity and our view has not changed at all in terms of the strength of that platform for those use case and those deployments.","From a spending standpoint, I mean, we look at the same CapEx reports for the cloud providers that you do and obviously these are all encompassing CapEx reports that capture all of their investments across many different technology areas. And yes, there could be shifts and priorities for some of the largest cloud providers in terms of where they're going to be focusing their investment in different layers of the network or between different areas of IT that can impact the timing of deployments, and I suspect that is a function of what we're seeing out in the market.","This is why, I don't just look at the CapEx reports, I also look at just the overall health of their own businesses, and I mean they're going to report soon. I don't expect any major slowdown. I expect that they are going to see robust business growth for them, and that is going to translate into a need to continue to invest into their networking infrastructure. We obviously can't predict the timing of build outs perfectly. Sometimes, they themselves can't predict their own timing, which makes it especially challenging for us. But what we can do is control everything that we can control in order to ensure that we capture the uptick in spending when it actually happen and there is the technology element to that, the talent element to that and the engagement element to that, that I've already talked to.","Tal Liani","If I measure your performance in terms of units, ports and I apologize, I missed the first two questions. So maybe you answered this, but if I measure your performance with cloud in different ways, not in dollars, but rather ports, units, any other way. Will you have the same answer and I'm asking the question just because there is a pricing difference between PTX and MX and per ports. I'm trying to understand if what we're seeing is more of a pricing transition or what we're seeing is really overall kind of big picture spending pressure?","Rami Rahim","I would say that the port or the number of ports or this volume of capacity that we have shipped into the cloud vertical this year has already far exceeded what it was year-to-date last year. So, I mean and port spending and consumption will fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis, so it's actually more instructive to look at this on a yearly basis, but what we're seeing is, it's much more a function of price per port at least as it pertains to Juniper and our own projects, then it is volume of ports that we're actually shipping to the cloud providers.","And again this since it's actually a good question that you're asking here. At the November analyst day conference, I think we can provide you with some more data that would give you the, what you're looking for in terms of actual port and capacity introduction into their networks.","Operator","Our next question is from Tejas Venkatesh from UBS.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you. I\u2019m on for John Roy. Following on from the previous question, I was wondering how 100-gig pricing for routing was in the quarter. You had indicated stability in the prior quarter. Is that still the case?","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Our pricing has been very consistent from a like to like perspective, whether it be 100-gig to 100-gig or PTX to PTX. So we are seeing that normalize within the cloud routing as well as the SP routing. In fact, from a cloud all up routing perspective, we saw the ASP go up per port because we didn't see as much PTX mix as we expected to see as we enter the quarter, but on a like-for-like, it was very, very stable.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you. And a long-term question as a follow-up, you've made a number of announcements around network automation and Contrail in recent months. Is there a way of thinking about how much incremental TAM this brings to Juniper and perhaps the industry?","Rami Rahim","Yeah, it's a good question. In some sense, it does introduce new TAM because there is in fact a certain amount of spend that goes into automation and orchestration across a number of different use cases, whether it be in telco cloud or in multi-cloud for the enterprises and so on. It's a TAM that\u2019s measured in billions, it's something that we can\u2019t provide you with some more specifics around. It's not a small TAM, but that's only part of the strategy.","Capturing that software investment as net new revenue for Juniper is something that we, of course, intend to do, but what we're also seeing, which is equally important to us is the fact that the software, the automation capabilities that we're introducing into the market are giving us an ability to sell holistic solutions.","So for a Tier 1 telecom operator in Europe, we are essentially providing a complete stack from the server compute storage up through orchestration and VNF, the Virtual Network Functions, all up as a solution. There is the software and the hardware element to that sale. Increasingly in the enterprise space, as we're selling Contrail, whether it's immediate or eventually over time, Contrail Enterprise Multicloud becomes a strategic control point that allows us to sell additional infrastructure like switching and like security and like routing in time and we're already seeing that play out. Contrail Enterprise Multicloud has only been shipping now for a few weeks. We already have our first few wins that validate that solution sales thesis that I just described and this is why we are so optimistic about these capabilities that we're introducing to the market.","Operator","Our next question is from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse.","Sami Badri","Hi, thank you for the question. I wanted to touch on the cloud deals very quickly and regarding them getting pushed out. I wanted to get more color on what type of cloud deals these actually are and more specifically, are these the very major 100 megawatt datacenter facilities that our cloud providers building or are they more Metro dense sites that aggregate significant traffic on the routing level. I just want to get an understanding on where exactly in the cloud supply chain this stall and deployments is occurring?","Rami Rahim","It's most -- the way I would characterize it is, it is the pace at which deployments are happening. And this is -- this touches the footprint that we have already deployed across the cloud space, which is in the wide area. So, data center interconnect backbone, it's -- these are real routing footprints that carry large volumes of traffic between data centers and connect the data centers to peering points that varies from cloud provider to cloud provider, but generally speaking, we're talking about wide area connectivity.","Sami Badri","And then those are predominantly PTX deployments not MX or historically MX was used, but now moving forward, using mainly PTX?","Rami Rahim","That is the nature of the transition. Yes. So historically, they've primarily been MX-based and going forward, they will mostly be PTX based. There will still be even within the cloud vertical, some use cases that rely on the programmability, the sophisticated feature set of the MX, but most of the major projects and certainly the projects that we're monitoring closely in terms of pace of deployments is -- are all around PTX.","Sami Badri","And the second question I had was more of a big picture regarding 5G, based on your conversations with customers or the expectations of demand for 5G deployments, which products do you see customers deploying first from your suite of systems? And are there products that may they may potentially move away from, given the type of infrastructure they're looking to scale up as 5G ramps?","Rami Rahim","Yeah. It's another good question. It really depends a lot on use case and we view it as follows. There is a very big telco cloud solution that involves our switching technology as well as Contrail Enterprise Multicloud and our own network functions like security network functions as well as third-party network functions that all stitched together in preparation for 5G. In the backbone, it's a combination of MX and PTX. In the Metro, it's mostly MX and ACX. And so the product that will depend very much on the particular use case that you are talking about.","I will also just mention here that we're working very closely with our partners to capture the 5G opportunity. Ericsson being a partnership that is long standing, but certainly one that we've only increased the strategic nature of recently and there are a number of solutions, yet to be announced externally that we're working on in concert with Ericsson to I think give us both an additional sort of means of competing in the 5G opportunity. So just stay tuned for that.","Operator","Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off with digging into the gross margin performance in the quarter a bit. You saw strong improvements in the gross margin on both products and services sequentially, even when like product revenues were sequentially lower. So just wanted to understand if there were any cost actions that you started off in 3Q itself outside of normal seasonality, what the other things that help gross margin here. And I think if I can ask more kind of 4Q and then beyond are there cost actions on the core business that you can take to improve gross margins?","Rami Rahim","Yes. So we're very pleased with our gross margin results in Q3 being above the range that we set in the beginning of the quarter. Clearly, we continue to undertake specific efforts to improve our gross margin, including innovation and design for value efforts as well as cost optimization within supply chain and customer service. Customer service, actually, the majority of the increase that they saw was not only a better volume from a sequential basis, but also good cost controls on the service delivery costs. So, that was really more of a cost controls perspective on the services gross margin uplift.","On the product side, really the biggest driver was product mix as well as a little bit of geographic mix, but within product mix, we did see sequential growth in service provider and in routing all up and that's our highest margin product and within routing, even seen more mix of MX as compared to PTX was also a bit of a tailwind for our overall margin.","So, those kind of product mix phenomenons that we saw in Q3, I do not expect to have similar mix in Q4. So when I guided Q4 at 60%, very much in line with our expectation and very much in line with our expectation that it would grow sequentially throughout the year. It is still down sequentially due to those mix impacts, not necessarily being as favorable in Q4 as we saw in Q3.","Samik Chatterjee","And if I can just follow up with one on the tariff impact. You mentioned that once you kind of take pricing, you might see some customer buying behavior changes. When you look at Europe customer segments, enterprises, service providers, customers, where do you see the most sensitivity to kind of pricing actions, if you take any pricing, where do you think you'll see kind of the most impact when it comes to buying behavior?","Rami Rahim","Yeah, I mean, difficult to predict at this point. At this point, I don't expect a material change in behavior. But it is a risk worth calling out. I think many customers are evaluating their own strategies within the tariffs and what is going to be monitoring and at this point, I don't expect it to be to impact our guide. However, it's just in a new risk I wanted to call out on the call.","Operator","Our next question is form Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] on behalf of Rod. I have two questions. The first one I really wanted to just check in on the EMEA strength that you've been posting. Clearly, your EMEA business throughout 2018 has been better than at least the last couple of years. Wondering what's driving that strength, is it market share gains, is it service providers or enterprise traction, if you could quantify, that would be very helpful.","Rami Rahim","I'd be happy to. So very proud of the EMEA team for delivery and consistently throughout the year across the board really. So the strength is pretty broad-based across all technologies, routing, switching and security as well as in the service provider and we had pretty substantial momentum in the enterprise space as well. I think that the EMEA team under relatively new sales leadership has been executing well. I think that the solutions that we have developed, both for the telcos, in particular, what we have real strength in tier 1 telcos have resonated with many of our customers there that are looking for partners in making this cloud transition.","And then in the enterprise space, I think there, our cloud delivered enterprise strategy where we're delivering value through a cloud delivered motion like SD-WAN being an example of that is resonating well with our customers over there as well. And from a momentum standpoint, I'm pretty optimistic that it can continue.","Unidentified Analyst","And just a quick one on switching as well. I think the performance in that business for the last three quarters or call it four quarters has been a little bit disappointing relative to consensus expectations. And if you look at the numbers that the street is modeling, the expectation for 2019 is a mid-single digit growth, while I recognize you won't be commenting on how much growth you expect, maybe would you care to elaborate on what would need to work for you for you to be able to get to that sort of growth or perform better than that.","Rami Rahim","Yeah. So let me say, I am disappointed in our performance in switching for Q3. I think that we can and we'll do better. And let me just double click on the switching business a bit for you to explain where the weakness was, but also where there is a strength and momentum that might not be evident by looking at the, the All Up number.","First, there is an element of our switching business that is very much tied to the cloud architectural transitions in our large hyper scalers that has had an impact and continues to have an impact as we work through the timing of new deployments within the large hyper scale data centers or large hyper scale opportunities that are out there.","Second, we had some specific weakness in Asia Pacific in switching mostly as a result of sort of difficult compares and timing of opportunities. But if I put those two factors aside, what I like about our switching business is first momentum in the enterprise, both in the data center and also in the campus and we've introduced new capabilities, new products like multi-rate capabilities in our switching portfolio that is gaining some real potential, real momentum and building pipeline for the enterprise in particular.","Second, we're seeing solid telco growth with our switching portfolio, primarily driven by telco data center and telco cloud build outs that I've already talked about. Third 100-gig adoption in our switching portfolio is working quite well for us. So the pace of 100-gig growth or 100-gig capable product is actually growing far faster than the overall switching number is growing. And then last but not least, a big part of the very healthy all up software business that we posted for Q3 is a result of selling software capabilities, along with our switching portfolio.","So I think these underlying elements of the business give me confidence that once we address the hyper scale architectural transition and of course we continue the momentum we're seeing in the rest of the switching business, we can get this business to growth next year.","Ken Miller","Yeah. And we will update our long-term model at the upcoming Investor Day on November 9 and we're not going to get into specifics of 2019 right now, but I will say overall, we expect revenues to be up in 2018. As Rami mentioned, the architectural shift in the cloud should largely be behind us and we expect the cloud vertical to be a growth year in 2019. And we see continued strength in enterprise. We believe those factors have more than offset potential weakness in the service provider space. In addition to the top line growth, we are expecting profits and operating margins to expand in FY19 as well, but again, more details to come in our upcoming Investor Day.","Operator","And our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back on the MX and PTX router transition and maybe take a little bit differently in your service provider vertical. Can you just remind us again of what keeps that vertical from seeing a similar transition from MX to PTX longer term and how would you characterize the competitive landscape as you move towards the new Penta Silicon relative to what would be probably new platforms based on Jericho2, as we start to look into 2019 and I have a quick follow-up.","Rami Rahim","Certainly. So it's having understanding of how the ratio of MX to PTX looks like between the different verticals, really comes down to understanding the use cases. In the cloud space, in particular in the hyper-scale cloud, most of the use cases are about high-performance connectivity. The value is primarily delivered from the data center, right, software that's running in the datacenter. And so what the cloud providers value our cost optimization, programmability, telemetry capabilities, the ability to host their own applications on the systems for certain elements of control that they really need in their networks, whether that be in the data center or in the wide area and all of these factors point towards the PTX.","And that's why the transition has happened so rapidly. In the telco space, as I've mentioned, the ratio of MX to PTX has largely been unchanged. I do expect that the PTX will pick up more dedicated, very optimized core use cases in time, but it will be a slow and sort of moderate transition. The main reason is that in the telco space, many of the services that are being offered by telecom operators have embedded in the networks themselves and have a degree of requirement sophistication, the only products like the MX can in fact offer.","And you've mentioned the roadmap with the Penta Silicon. What we do is, even if our customers start to think about what it is that they need to deploy in order to satisfy their use cases, we're always innovating with new generations in the MX that are improving the capacity, the performance and improving the cost efficiency of that platform substantially that makes it so that, it's just not worth in many use cases to look at alternative platform. That Penta silicon gives us a 300% improvement in performance at half of the power consumption with all of the programmability capabilities that our customers love, built in encryption and a whole host of other capabilities that just our customers truly love.","The last question, I think, since you've mentioned Jericho, the MX is really in a class of its own when it comes to the inherent programmability and flexibility of that platform. The Jericho platform, Jericho based platforms are more competitive with PTX type systems out there and that's the comparison that I would make, the MX really from a silicon and the software standpoint is not one that one could easily, in any way build using merchant silicon at least for the time being.","Operator","Our final question is from Jamie Fish from Piper Jaffray.","Jamie Fish","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Actually, most of my questions have been answered and I won't ask the 10th question on the cloud vertical for you. I guess just on the software side, I assume you're going to give more color around what you guys expect that to get longer term. But what were the one-time items this quarter again on the 10% and why should we now expect that 10% level to sort of be maintained, as we move forward as your attach rates of software seem to be doing fairly well.","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Thanks for the question, James. So the components of software are broken out as follows. There is the newer software capabilities that we would describe as off-box. Our orchestration, our management software currently are -- obviously our enterprise Multicloud solutions, our off box software capabilities that would fit into that bucket and that is a small, but growing element of the overall software business. What is a more meaningful component is our Junos capabilities, our network operating system capabilities, where we have been executing on a very deliberate strategy over the last several years to disaggregate our operating system capabilities and give our customers choice of how much flexibility they want to buy and that's really working for us because it allows us to be very competitive with the appropriate pricing for less sophisticated use cases, but then to monetize the solution better as they go into more sophisticated use cases where the full breadth of routing and MPLS capabilities are required.","I would say that that is a big part of the performance that we saw in the Q3 timeframe. There is a third leg of the software store, which is really around the solutions that are going to be offered to the enterprise like SD-WAN and so on. There is still a very small element today, but I expect, based on the momentum we're seeing in the market, I mean you saw just recently our Vodafone SD-WAN announcement that this element will grow in time. ","The reason why I wouldn't expect 10% on an ongoing basis is simply lumpiness, I mean, customers are going to buy the capabilities and the upgrades to existing deployed infrastructure based on the requirements and where I don't think it's reasonable to assume that every quarter going forward will be this level. However, I do think that this part of the business is working and over a longer term period, I do expect it to grow.","Ken Miller","Yeah. And just to add to that, the on-box advanced Junos kind of features and functions are what we saw an uptick in, in Q3. While we have many different software models, the majority of our software today, particularly the on-box software is in perpetual model. So when those orders come in, which we saw a fair amount of those in Q3, they show up as a bit of a lumpy transition. As we move forward, we're working on different business models that would make that revenue more ratable, but at this point, some of that perpetual revenue was hitting Q3 and I don't expect that to be similar in the next couple of quarters.","Jess Lubert","So that's all the time we have today. Thank you all for your questions and we look forward to hopefully seeing you at our November 9 Analyst Day in New York.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

And welcome to the Juniper Networks Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may now begin.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon. And welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer.","Today's call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, capital return program, the expected amount of our impairment charge and overall future prospects.","Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call.","Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP results. Unless otherwise noted, revenue growth rates have been normalized for the sale of the Junos Pulse business.","For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today.","Full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, our earnings release and the presentation slides for this call can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.juniper.net.","Please note that today\u2019s call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per phone.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome everyone. I am delighted to join you today on my first quarterly conference call as CEO of Juniper. First, let\u2019s talk about what we have accomplished and what I see ahead.","2014 was a year of significant change for Juniper. We made major strides having implemented a series of initiative designed to streamline our organization, reduced our cost structure, improve our balance sheet, return capital to our shareholders and drive long-term profitable growth in a challenging revenue environment.","In many areas we exceeded our commitment by working in a more efficient manner with greater accountability and customer connectiveness. And while we achieved much in 2014, I recognize that there is still more we can do to realize the full potential of our company.","Rest assured, we are moving with urgency. We are very excited about the changes that are taking place in the industry and inside Juniper, and we believe that our best days are still ahead.","To that end, let me share with you what I have been up to in my first few months as CEO. I have spent considerable time talking and listening to our customers, our partners and our employees. Working with the senior leadership team, I set out key execution initiatives for 2015 aligned with our R&D and go-to-market strategy in the areas of routing, switching and security for both service providers and enterprise customers.","I appointed Jonathan Davidson as Head of Juniper\u2019s Development and Innovation or JDI to ensure a smooth transition and uninterrupted focus on our product roadmap. Jonathan is an accomplished leader and technologist who knows how to bring focus and clarity to developing the innovative products our customers require.","I moved network automation project that have graduated out of the incubation phase from the office of the CTO to JDI to ensure tighter alignment with the rest of our portfolio and end-to-end solution development. And I oversaw a comprehensive review of the security components of our business including our capabilities and product roadmap.","While my new role at Juniper now has the added dimension of ensuring that our business performs across a range of metric, I will, as I always have try to ensure we build and deliver great products that advance the state-of-the-art and network innovation, and drive long-term growth for the company.","I\u2019ll spend some time now articulating our strategy. How we plan to execute against our vision and our 2015 initiatives. First, our strategy, we will deliver the most scalable, reliable, secure and cost effective networks, while revolutionizing their agility, efficiency and value through automation.","We will focus on customers and partners across our key verticals, who view these network attributes as fundamental to their businesses. Product and solution differentiation with the relentless customer focus will allow us to achieve our primary goal of growing revenue faster than the market.","Second, on execution, our innovation engine is running stronger than ever and we are executing on a compelling product roadmap that will drive future growth across routing, switching and security. I'm very excited about our product pipeline, which has never been better and will offer our customers break through performance and impressive capabilities unmatched in the industry.","In security, I acknowledge that it has underperformed and we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the quarter. 2015 will be a year of stabilizing our security revenue. To win insecurity, we are pivoting our strategy to building integrated solutions that focus our network resiliency and business continuity across cloud, data center, branch, campus and service provider mobile infrastructure.","To emphasis, we are focusing on areas where we can compete effectively and I am confident that we will do just that. And importantly, we will be employing a high leverage development strategy that takes advantage of the existing and ongoing innovation within Juniper.","Our common threat through all of this is our Junos based SRX platform, which is adaptable to serve all of this environment and can accommodate the security needs of any number of different use cases.","With this new strategy in effect, we will be delivering substantial enhancements to the SRX platform in 2015 and they will be closely intertwined with the network. We believe this new approach will allow us to deliver superior offering and we have energized team focus on helping our customer get in front of their security challenges.","Our exciting product portfolio along with our focus go-to-market models are coming together to create real competitive advantage for our customers. We have a sound strategy in place, we are executing well against our plan and we continue to make progress with new design wins and diversification of our business across our target verticals and geographies.","I\u2019d like to turn now to the macroenvironment and our business. I am confident in Juniper\u2019s future and I see substantial opportunities to grow and deliver value over the long-term.","In the near-term, we continue to face headwinds in U.S. carrier spending. However, we do expect an improvement in spending in the later half of this year. We have signaled in July of 2014 that the market was going to be challenging and we ran our business under the assumption that it would be so for the full four quarters cycles that we have historical seen.","Based on recent conversations with our customers, we still expect that to be the case with a return to growth in investment in the second half of this year. Although 2014 routing revenue declined 4%, the diversity of our business helped offset the decline from U.S. carriers. We continue to see growth in routing from cloud providers, cable, financial services and strategic enterprise customers that are building and operating their own network infrastructure.","In switching, we are just at the early stages of an exciting journey of growth. It will be more to come from me over time on this topic as we take a leap in performance in automation in the datacenter switching space. Let me announce that expectations moving forward.","While we navigate industry and customer dynamics in the near term, we have continued to focus on things that matter most to our customers and our shareholders. There are no changes to our planning assumption. Juniper remains committed to the financial targets we set out at our Investor Day last October where we stated an overall growth rate of 3% to 6% over the next three years.","We are continuing to manage the business prudently. We maintain our stated non-GAAP OpEx target of $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million. We are also committed to continuing the aggressive capital return plans that we have been executing again.","To summarize, our team remains steadfast. We will drive profitable growth and develop and deliver the innovative IP networking products and solutions that our customers rely on. We will continue to be intensely focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiative. I will be monitoring our business closely and will report on our progress quarterly.","In closing, I thank our employees for their resiliency through a year of much change. Juniper employees around the world continue to focus on executing as one Juniper. And I\u2019m proud of and grateful for their dedication. I also appreciate the continued support of our shareholders, partners and customers.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Robyn to provide more details of our financial results and our revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2015.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. Before I review the Q4 and full year results, I want to update you on our restructuring and share repurchases, as well as give you the context of the goodwill impairment charge.","We have completed the restructuring actions that we first announced in February of 2014. In Q4, we exceeded our expense reduction commitment and implemented the additional structural actions to achieve the $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million OpEx target for 2015. As Rami mentioned, one of the actions we completed during the quarter was the tightened focus of our security portfolio, allowing us to dedicate our security resources to the SRX platform.","Total restructuring and asset write-down charges for Q4 were approximately $29 million and for the full year 2014 were $209 million. We also finalized the sale of Junos Pulse and recorded $20 million net gain. We are executing very well on our capital return plans. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in December and repurchased $500 million of shares in Q4.","For 2014, we have returned $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders and we are reaffirming our commitment to return a total of $4.1 billion to our shareholders through 2016. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our cost structure and the progress that we\u2019ve made towards achieving the capital return commitments we made to our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019d like to address the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in Q4. As required under GAAP accounting rules, we will perform a regular review of the carrying value of goodwill. During Q4, this review resulted in an estimated non-cash impairment charge of $850 million related to the goodwill of our security reporting unit.","There are several factors which contributed to this impairment including the recent underperformance of this reporting unit and our assets to refocus our security offerings in addition to the divestitures of Junos Pulse. Combined these factors result in a delay in achieving revenue and profit forecast needed to support the historical security goodwill valuation.","I want to remind everyone that this accounting charge has no direct effect on Juniper\u2019s cash balance, operating cash flows or business outlook. We remain committed to the long-term growth targets that we outlined at our October investor meeting.","Now, let\u2019s return to an analysis of the Q4 result. As a reminder, the following revenue commentary and growth rates have been normalized for the sale of Junos Pulse. Overall, revenue and demands of the fourth quarter was better than we expected. However, the things that we have discussed over the last six months remain consistent. That is large U.S. carrier demand continues to be vague but has been somewhat offset by healthy demand from cloud providers and cable customers, pockets of momentum in EMEA and APAC service providers and improving enterprise demand.","Looking at our demand metrics, products book to bill was much greater than one. We exceeded 2014 with about $445 million in product backlog. Total revenue for the quarter was $1,102 billion, down 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially.","Product revenue was $794 million, down 17% from last year and essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Services revenue was $308 million, up 8% year-over-year and 2% from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.41, excluding the benefit of the R&D tax credit of $0.03, non-GAAP diluted earnings would have been down $0.05 per share year-over-year and up $0.02 sequentially.","The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower revenue, partially offset by the cost reductions and the positive impact of $0.06 from reduced checkout. The sequential increase was largely driven by improvements in our cost structure.","For the quarter, GAAP loss per share was $1.81, which includes the $850 million impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this impairment charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.19. Included in this result is $0.07 impact for restructuring and other charges and $0.04 benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit and a $0.05 benefit from the gain of the sale of Junos Pulse.","Now let\u2019s look at revenue results in detail by the product area. Routing product revenue was $523 million, down 15% year-over-year and a 2% decline from the prior quarter. Year-over-year decline was driven by weakness from our large U.S. carriers partially offset by strength in cloud providers.","Switching product revenue was $174 million, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, primarily due to declines in enterprise. Quarter-over-quarter switching product revenue increased 13%, driven by demand from cloud providers and financial services for our QFX products.","Security product revenue was $97 million, rather disappointing 28% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. The decrease was due to a decline in the SRX platform from U.S. carrier customers, as well as the continued declines from ScreenOS products.","Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were 64.1%, compared to 64.2% a year ago and the elevated level of 65.2% last quarter.","Non-GAAP product gross margins were 64.3%, down six-tenths of a point from a year ago and 1.8 points from last quarter. The expected sequential decline was primarily attributable to a shift in product and geography mix.","Non-GAAP services gross margins was 63.6%, up 1.7 points from a year ago and six-tenths of a point quarter-over-quarter. This increase was due to lower support-related costs from operational improvements and variable cost savings.","We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $465 million, below our guidance range and down $74 million, or 14% year-over-year. This reflects the implementation of the additional cost savings commitment announced on our Q3 2014 earnings call, as well as the significant benefit from the reduction in variable expenses in the quarter.","Our headcount ended the year at 8,806, a decline of 677 employees or 7% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter were 21.9%, flat year-over-year despite lower revenue. This is due to our significant focus on cost reduction efforts.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 21%, down 6.1 points from the prior quarter, primarily due to the $13 million of one-time benefits from the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2014. The GAAP tax expense in the quarter was $75 million on a GAAP loss of $694 million, resulting in a negative tax rate of 11%.","The GAAP loss is due to the goodwill impairment charge, which is the non-deductible tax item. The GAAP tax rate this quarter was also impacted by the gain on the sale of Junos Pulse.","Now, I\u2019d like to discuss the 2014 full year results. Total revenue was $4,532 billion, approximately flat from last year. For the full year, large U.S. carrier revenues declined, offset by an increase from cloud providers and cables and a steady performance from enterprise.","While we are not happy with the overall results, we are successfully achieving diversification of our customer service and increasing the relevance of our products across multiple customers\u2019 segment.","We are adding product revenues and finished the year down 4%, primarily due to the softness from U.S. carriers in the second half. Switching product revenue was up 13% for the full year, driven by growth from cloud providers.","Security product revenue was down 14% for the full year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in the legacy ScreenOS products. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.3% for the full year, approximately flat with 2013.","This is a good result and represents the value our customers\u2019 same innovation, as well as our intense focus on supply chain cost reductions. The benefits of which offsets both revenue mix changes and the normal levels of pricing pressure.","I\u2019m pleased with the improvement in our overall cost structure. We ended the year with $2.15 billion of non-GAAP operating expenses, down $88 million or 4% from 2013. This decrease in OpEx allowed us to expand non-GAAP operating margins by 1.5 points to end the full year at 20.7%, despite the challenging revenue environment.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $1.45, up $0.17 or 13% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to positive impact of approximately $0.12 per share from a reduction in share count of 9% year-over-year, as well as significantly lower operating expenses for the full year.","GAAP loss per share was $0.73, which includes the impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this charge, GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $1.11, inclusive of the $0.45 impact of restructuring and other charges.","We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of net cash and investments. The decline from Q3 was primarily due to the capital return of $542 million in the quarter. For the quarter, we generated good operating cash flow of $291 million and $763 million for the full year.","DSO was 49 days, which is flat from last quarter. During 2014, in order to foster our channel business and reduce our expenses, we transition some of that distributor financing to Juniper\u2019s balance sheet through a targeted financial services program with certain partners. Going forward, we expect DSO to be in a range of 45 to 55 days.","Now, I will provide an outlook for Q1 of 2015. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. We continue to expect that demand environment for our largest U.S. carrier customers to be challenging throughout the first half of 2015.","As we have said, we are two quarters into what we expect to be a full quarter cycle and as a result, we remain cautious in our revenue planning assumption. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range from $1.20 billion to $1.60 billion.","Gross margins are expected to be 63.5%, plus or minus 0.5% at the lower end of our long-term range due to the lower volume. Operating expenses are expected to be $475 million, plus or minus $5 million and as a reminder, our Q4 2014 results included a significant benefit of variable cost savings.","We remain focused on our cost structure and we are committed to managing expenses throughout 2015. Operating margins are expected to be approximately 18% at the midpoint of guidance. And we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be 27% for the first quarter, assuming no extensions of the R&D tax credit for 2015.","We expect diluted earnings per share of between $0.28 and $0.32 per share, assuming a weighted average share count of approximately $420 million. I\u2019m also pleased to report that the Board has approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the first quarter.","I would like to thank our teams for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success.","Now, let\u2019s open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Pierre Ferragu","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe on your -- on all the comments you\u2019ve made on the service provider outlook, do you have a sense from technicians you had with your clients of what drove so relatively sudden slowdown in spending that started about a couple of quarters ago? And\/or so what would be the driver behind like recovering, spending in the second half of the year?","And then beyond the -- of course beyond the U.S. and the rest of the world, if you could give us a bit of flavor of how the service provider business is likely to reply for you in 2015. What I am wondering of course is, if we have a recovery in the second half of 2015 in the U.S. and if it becomes more clearly visual for you, is there a risk of seeing the sustaining in the rest of the world? Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Okay. Thank you, Pierre. So let me just address your first question, which is around the service provider outlook, primarily here in the United States. There are number of factors that we look at. Obviously as we talk to our customers and we engage with them very closely, number one would be things around the timing of projects that we\u2019ve been working with them on. We are looking obviously at macro trends that are happening around M&A activity, the investment split between wireline and wireless that are large service provider customers that are currently expecting to undertake spectrum auctions.","All of these have contributed to our assessment, but it makes sense for us at this point to maintain our prudent outlook looking forward and manage our business accordingly. Now that said, we are engaging with them on an ongoing basis. And based on that engagement, the timing of projects and so forth, we do anticipate that their investment levels would start to recover in the second half of this year.","On your second question, which is more around the geo-profile for service providers, and maybe more broadly speaking, let me just touch on the Juniper business as it pertains to our performance across the globe. And I will touch on it more from a service provider standpoint, because I believe that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in just from your question.","In EMEA, I am actually pleased with our performance and the momentum that we\u2019re seeing both in the smaller Tier 2, Tier 3 service providers that have really adopted a number of our products, especially our MX and PTX products as a build-out converged infrastructures and we are actually seeing some good momentum in the quarter as well in the Q4 timeframe.","And in APAC, there its bit more of a complex answer because I think the situation in places like China is somewhat different than the outside of China. In China, we have to be very laser-focused on opportunities that we believe we actually have a good chance of winning and it\u2019s very much a partner-led model in doing so. And that can result in some lumpiness.","Now we actually had some good sequential performance in China in Q4. But generally speaking, as I said, that could be lumpy. More broadly speaking, outside of China, as you look at South Asia for example, there based on a number of wins that we\u2019ve had historically and ongoing projects that we are working on, we are actually doing quite well and I am pleased with our performance there. And I expect that to continue throughout this year in 2015.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ehud Gelblum","Hey, guys. Thank you. Appreciate it. Couple of things. First of all, Rami, just an open-ended question, I know, it\u2019s been more specific. But the open-end question is, what difference are you -- you\u2019re making a lot of difference I\u2019m sure, but what different strategies have you set in place vis-\u00e0-vis website I was doing when you first came in and I did a full review of the product portfolio and took a look at couple businesses, continues posting one of that sold?","Are there any other fundamental things that you\u2019re changing or are you basically just taking current strategy that was there before that you obviously had a lot to do with and continuing it nicely? I have a follow-up that\u2019s more specific [indiscernible]?","Rami Rahim","Okay. Let me address that question, thanks Ehud. So first, yes, you are right, you have to keep in mind that I was a part of the leadership team that developed, created that strategy and it\u2019s a strategy that I very much believe in. It\u2019s a strategy that from a go-to-market standpoint is laser-focused on key verticals that we believe will value the types of technologies and products that we develop and where we have the maximum chance of success. It\u2019s a strategy where from an R&D standpoint, we\u2019re really executing on the performance, scale capabilities that customers require, but just as importantly the software-driven innovation around automation, absolutely fundamental. So, that all remains absolutely intact. And we are executing towards that.","There are changes or twist to the strategy as it pertains to security. I mentioned some of that in my prepared remarks upfront. But just to reiterate, we are pivoting away from thinking about security from a standpoint of Point products. We are moving much more towards integrated solutions across switching, routing and security that address domain level problems that our customers want from us. And we are executing on a very high leverage strategy and engineering across switching, routing and security.","I will just say that there are tremendous assets across silicon and routing, or as I should say silicon and software that have largely gone untapped for security. And we have this incredible opportunity as a part, as a function of this new strategy to leverage these assets to give us relatively quick gains in the performance, scale and capabilities of our security products, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to be executing on now.","Kathleen Nemeth","You had a follow-up. Go ahead. Okay. The next question.","Operator","Certainly, the next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski","Hi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask how much visibility you have into the ramp in the second half with some of your U.S. carrier customers and specifically the timing of the domain sort of ramp that you\u2019ve been designed into? And taking that into account, assuming that those customers can normalize in the second half do you think it\u2019s possible for your revenues for the year to grow as a whole?","Rami Rahim","Okay. So as far as the service provider timing, nobody has a crystal ball that tells us exactly what is going to be. But again based on the data that we gathered from our customer on an ongoing basis and understanding of the macro trends, we do believe second half will resume the growth that we had anticipated as we have said earlier Simona.","I can\u2019t really talk about any specific projects, but I will say this, we are very tightly aligned with our large service provider customers, both here in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Everybody, many of our customers are looking at new approach to delivering services to their end users using cloud-based service delivery models. And I believe that we are very well-positioned with the products that we have [Technical Difficulty] having the strategy that we\u2019re executing on to set ourselves up to participate in the growth once it resumes.","So I can\u2019t talk about any specific projects, but I can say, products like our virtual MX, products like the virtual SRX or what we call the Firefly that really represent a new way of service delivery using cloud-based models are exactly the kind of products that our customers are requesting today. And I think set ourselves up for success when spending starts to recover.","Kathleen Nemeth","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ashwin Kesireddy of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Kesireddy","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rami, could you comment on the strength in switching and how should we think about that going forward? Any color you could provide on the drivers of market share gains will be helpful. And I was hoping you could elaborate on some of the security features you\u2019re planning to add to SRX and give us more concrete timelines on when you\u2019re planning to add these new features.","And then I\u2019ve got one question for Robyn. I was trying to understand some of the factors that could have influenced the timing of the impairment. Why did you decide to pay that now? Is it just due to normal year end process? Are there any changes in customer contracts or other factors that could have led to this?","Rami Rahim","Okay. Thanks for the question. Let me start with the switching and security and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Robyn for your last question. On the switching side, I think you need to keep in mind that around two, two and a half years ago, we took a step back and under -- and we set up a new strategy in switching or we took a lot of lessons that we had learned from the first set of products that we introduced into the market in the roadmap that we are now executing towards.","So if you look at what we just announced last year, our QFX5100, our OCX1100 product, which is essentially a Junos-based white box switch. These are just the beginning of what I would consider a very compelling product roadmap that our customers are going to respond very well to in switching.","And I have alluded to in the past and I will just reiterate again that we will continue the rolling thunder if you will of new products and switching this year that will contribute to the momentum that we expect. Now there are two dimensions to our switching business. There is, of course, the enterprise and the service provider. Service provider dimension has always been somewhat lumpy, and as a result of that predicting the ups and downs is not going to be all that easy, but I expect to continue to take market share in switching as a result of our go-to-market focus and our product strategy.","In security, I can't really get into the timing, although you'll find out when we make the public announcements. I will just say that I'm very excited and encouraged by what the team has accomplished thus far. And just to give you a clue, because it is a high leverage strategy, it does not involve a large amount of time. We\u2019re essentially leveraging technologies that we have already developed in the company but now packaging them up and testing them in a way that they contribute to our security capabilities. And they will be capabilities from the standpoint of performance, scale and our ability to detect and stop threat factors in the competition. Robyn?","Robyn Denholm","And so Ashwin, let me just address the goodwill and the timing of the impairment charge. We do a regular review of the current value of goodwill as required under GAAP. In Q4, the underperformance of the security revenues continued and so we took another look at that. In Q4, we also took into account the other factors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks around the restructuring that we have done in that business area in the security roadmaps and then also the pivot on the strategy as well.","So all of those, as Rami mentioned before, culminated after his review of the security portfolio and so it\u2019s the combination of factors. It\u2019s not one factor that led us to impair the goodwill, the continuing underperformance and the product rationalization that we\u2019ve completed now.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Sue","Thank you. Rami, security, are we too lead into security at no longer standalone products in the future. Will you be leading and integrating it into routing and switching platforms, and is that something that customers are asking for?","And then, Robyn on cash, you are returning more than your annual cash flow in buybacks and dividends. How should we think of cash flow from operations going forward? I think it\u2019s around $800 million a year, maybe if you could just help us understand cash generation here versus abroad and the subsequent appropriate debt-to-equity ratio for Juniper?","Rami Rahim","Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let me start with the security question first and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Robyn. I believe, the industry is moving in the direction in which securities increasingly being intimately tied with switching and routing, where understanding traffic pattern and flows through switches and routers actually allow you to improve your security posture, substantially, overall, when you look at a domain like the data center cloud or the service provider edge.","So that\u2019s effectively the strategy that we\u2019re going to be executing towards. It does involve building security products and they are going to be very effective security products, but those products are going to be very much integrated if you will from a solution standpoint to switching and routing. They\u2019re going to be tested together and there will be a very high leveraging of technology components between silicon and software across three of these product lines.","So think of it from the standpoint of lots of cost synergies from the leveraging of technology, as well as revenue energy, very commensurate with what I believe that the industry is heading toward and how they think about the combinations of these products. Robyn?","Robyn Denholm","Thanks, Rami. And so, Mark, in terms of the cash position, as we mentioned that, we had strong operating cash flows for the year of 2014 about $763 million. We do generate cash strongly from the business in terms of our operating cash flow. We did last year return more than our free cash flow to shareholders.","On the past, we\u2019re on that task too and efficient capital structure as we\u2019ve outlined previously. And therefore, you would expect that to happen last year and through the first half of this year, we anticipate buying back about a billion dollar shares as we\u2019ve talked about before part of our repurchase and capital return program.","In terms of overall debt to cash ratio, we are looking to maintain our investment grade rating and therefore, we\u2019ll be now financial means in order to maintain that rating. And so that is what we\u2019re doing as a company and we continuing to execute to that capital -- efficient capital structure, as well as our investment credit rating.","Kathleen Nemeth","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani","Hi, guys. Sorry, I had to take it off mute. I have two quick questions. First one is about services, it declined 2.8% sequentially and in prior years it was always up in the fourth quarter. What is driving? I thought it's more stable source of revenue, so what is driving the decline? Second question is a follow-up \u2026..","Robyn Denholm","Tal. Sorry, I was going to answer that one for you.","Tal Liani","All right.","Robyn Denholm","Allow me to do that one for you?","Tal Liani","Yes.","Robyn Denholm","So, Tal, we provided to table in the slides. The decline was purely the result of the post divestiture. So when you normalize to that services for the post business, we\u2019re actually sequentially up. And so that business is very healthy as you see by the operating margins that we are yielding and actually the revenue continues to increase quite agnostically well.","Tal Liani","Thank you. So the question is about security and I am trying to understand the decline this quarter because over the last three years, there were two parts of security. SRX was up and the old NetScreen was down. And the magnitude of the decline this quarter suggest that SRX also has issues in the quarter that we -- in the period of time, not just the quarter where we see all other security companies reporting very strong quarters, very strong results.","And I\u2019m trying to understand what is wrong with SRX that is driving or what is missing, maybe it\u2019s a better way to phrase it? What is missing in SRX that is driving revenues down that much and how can you fix it? Can you discuss the parts that are weak and you are going to improve? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Sure, Tal. So you are right that there are two components to our security business. First is the NetScreen products or the ScreenOS products that have been in decline and continue to be decline, a fairly rapid decline in fact and now represents a relatively smaller fraction of our overall security business. The SRX products, they are the high end and the low end component and especially the high end component does have a sort of a lumpiness to it because it relies on large deals and typically they are service provider deals around the world.","So, we did see that impacts us to some extent in the Q4 timeframe. But I think the overarching message that I want to get across on this call is that I am not pleased or satisfied with the performance of our security business. I think we can and will do better and this is a competitive space and we have to operate and innovate under that assumption.","And that requires that we take a much more focused approach and ensuring that these products, the ones that you are asking about the Junos based products are going to be incredibly competitive against everybody else in the industry, especially as it pertains to integrated solutions of security and routing. That\u2019s exactly what we are going to be focusing on, and that\u2019s where you are going to see some of the enhancements that I have talked about coming out later this year.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks, Tal. Next question, Operator?","Operator","Certainly. The next question is from Bill Choi of Janney. Please go ahead.","Bill Choi","Okay. Thanks. Unfortunately, I\u2019m going to have to go back to security here as well. I guess the problem we are having Rami is security, if anything is getting more specialized, not generically integrated with networking component. So, I could see from Juniper\u2019s side how you could leverage your existing strengths and try to differentiate your solution. But which customers are actually asking for this?","Is this kind of to Tal\u2019s question, what kind of competitive dynamics are you seeing? Are you losing, when you are just focusing on your prior strength of your scalability, flows session? I mean, these were good enough to win, lead your businesses with mobile customers who were actually buying a ton of Gi firewalls going forward. So that\u2019s probably the big one.","Second just, if you guys could try to give a little more quantifications of the very positive comment on book-to-bill and perhaps kind of the visibility you might have on a product level basis, core versus edge routing and whether it\u2019s more of the switching design wins that you had that is converting into revenue? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Sure. Bill, thanks for the question. Let me address the security question and then I will hand it over to Robyn to talk about the financial metric that you are asking about. All right. The strategy that we need to be on is in fact the one that you are taking about right now, where we can -- we have to focus in areas where we can in fact be effective, where we actually have been effective historically.","If for example, you are talking about the Gi firewall, their scale, performance, power efficiencies and the effectiveness of stopping attacks is very much there. And there are in fact synergies there with routing. And so this back-to-basics approach that I have just described or I can leverage some of the silicon enhancements that I have already funded, that I have already invested in to improve my routing and switching, can be used very effectively and securities can be done and that\u2019s what we will do.","So, I recognized that we are probably stretching your patience a little bit here with respect to this business. But I also want to emphasize that I\u2019ve taken now a thorough look as part of my onboarding as CEO. And I\u2019ve looked at, where it is that we should focus and where we should not focus. And as a result of that, we\u2019ve come out with this high-leverage strategy that I think will make us very competitive in the securities space.","Robyn Denholm","And Bill, in terms of the book-to-bill, I can say that it was greater than one in fact I think much greater than one you replace with the book-to-bill, our backlog was at about $445 million exiting the year, roughly flat with the beginning of the fiscal year, which we\u2019ll replace about.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi","Hi. Thank you. I had question and then a follow-up. I guess my first question was for you Robyn. The midpoint of your revenue guidance is roughly about $1.04 billion. I think for last quarter it was $1.05 billion but your guided gross margins at 64% plus or minus last quarter and this quarter at 63.5%. So nothing of fact, just curious why the 50 basis point reduction and should we expect things to normalize around 64% as we progress through the year?","Robyn Denholm","Yes, but firstly thanks Amitabh. In terms of the gross margins to date, we did call out for the guidance range that there will be towards the low end of our long-term model that we\u2019re actually -- have been our long term targets that we called out in October. And then it\u2019s a fixed result of Q1 mix in all that volume reduction as we mentioned in the prepared remarks.","In terms of the ongoing gross margin on place with the performance of gross margin as I\u2019ve mentioned for the full year of 2014, we were roughly flat with \u201913. That\u2019s really a reflection of the intense focus that we have on the cost side of the supply chain and also a reflection of the value that customers see in the innovation that we are bringing to market. And so as we move forward here, we expect to be in the range that I talked about at the Investor Day which is 64 plus or minus a bit.","Amitabh Passi","I think there is still a lot of confusion out there in terms of what exactly vMX means for you for Juniper. Can you maybe clarify for us how exactly are you positioning the vMX? What are you hearing from your customers initially and how do they intend to buy the vMS versus your physical MX?","Rami Rahim","Yeah, sure. Let me try to demystify it for you. So if you look at Juniper\u2019s routing business overall, vMX is in fact a router, just has to be a virtualized router. We make the bulk of our revenue in the high performance end of that range i.e. the larger systems are the systems that sell the most, just by virtue of the applications and the used cases that we are solving for our customers. There is also market out there for low end routers.","It\u2019s a market that we are not as penetrated in today. It is a market where this trend of virtualization will in fact impact first because virtualization i.e. this movement of services in the case of virtual MX. It\u2019s a layer three routing service on to virtual machines that fit on standard servers is interesting in some -- and it\u2019s ability to deliver agility to our customers. But it certainly cannot keep up with the performance that our customers require for their high-end applications where we already are very well penetrated today.","So the net of what I\u2019ve just said is that, the Virtual MX represents a great opportunity for Juniper to go after the low-end routing environment and use cases for our customers. So where are our customers are thinking about deploying small PE router that the service provide edge, they now might consider using a Virtual MX software license, download it off of our website and deployed on a standard rack servers, that\u2019s a revenue opportunity for Juniper and of course, the profit opportunity for Juniper.","So it\u2019s highly complimentary with the rest of our portfolio. It still, I don\u2019t -- I want to also set some expectation, because the market is still in its early stages here. This is a developing market. But in developing and shipping this product, we are essentially sending the message and putting a stake in the ground to our customers that we want to participate in this emerging market with really compelling feature rich products, a product like this is one that we are -- we have to be proud enough of to put the MX logo on it and that\u2019s essentially what we have done.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Paul Silverstein","Thank you. Rami, I think a short way, in recent history all of you noticed that is, you are particularly focused on cloud opportunity and enterprise switching business. My question is, can you give us some breakdown between the cloud, data center portion of business than more generic to your assortment price campus use? And as we go forward, many metrics you can offer us in terms of number of customers, progress, et cetera, that speak to your success, to wonder you are another to go forward with respect to your switching business?","And one additional question, with respect to your new products in 2015, switching and routing? How much of the growth you expect will come from these new products and given that historically, there is a lag period for any company between product introduction and revenue generation, you are assuming success? What is the timeframe? What do you expecting in terms of timeframe in that as well?","Kathleen Nemeth","Paul, it\u2019s Kathleen. So we are as you know running closer on time, so which question would you like to prioritize?","Paul Silverstein","We will go with the first one Kathleen?","Kathleen Nemeth","All right. So the one on the cloud.","Rami Rahim","Okay. So on the cloud and especially as it pertain to the switching opportunity. If you look at our business today, there -- the bulk of our switching product fell into either data center or some combination of data center and campus.","And even when you look at the campus dimension of this, it\u2019s actually the larger, more mission critical campuses that we are going after, because quite frankly, it\u2019s geared toward customers that care about carrier class capabilities, performance and scalability that we address very well. So that is how I would look at the business today.","Now as we start to introduce some of the new products. Certainly, we will have an opportunity to go deeper into these exiting opportunities and the enterprise for data center and mission critical campus. But we also open up new opportunities in the cloud providers and financial services in particular. That\u2019s how we\u2019d characterize where we are today and the opportunity going forward.","I\u2019ll just touch very briefly on the second question which is a -- yes, I mean, you\u2019re right. Even if we introduce new products this year, there is the typical certification and qualification cycle that can take a quarter -- I should say few quarters by our customers. Enterprise customers will typical make that more on the lower end of the range, maybe a quarter to two quarters service by the customers could take nine months to a year of certification.","Kathleen Nemeth","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Subu Subrahmanyan of The Juda Group. Please go ahead.","Subu Subrahmanyan","Thank you. Rami, I wanted to ask about customer segments. You made the point at analyst event, how the cloud operators now represent 16% of revenues versus 14% for the U.S. large service providers. So one part of the growth story is waiting for the U.S. service providers tend to get better, the other part is you have higher exposure to the growing parts. So can you talk about the puts and takes, maybe talk about what the growth rate you\u2019re seeing in the faster growing segments are and how much reliance you still have on U.S. service providers to get better to see growth return in the second half?","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Sure, Subu. So certainly, you picked up on something that\u2019s very important, which is that -- and you see this in our Q4 results, in fact, which is that we have offset some of the weakness in the large U.S. service providers by diversifying our business across a number of key verticals including cloud providers and cable. That is by design, that is very much a function of our strategy. And I think that\u2019s a very healthy thing to do and we will continue to do just that.","So whereas we anticipate a recovery in spending by our large service provider customers in the second half, we certainly are not counting completely on that. We\u2019re also executing on this high diversification strategy across all of our key verticals both from a go-to-market focus standpoint as well as from the solutions that we\u2019re developing for those verticals.","Robyn Denholm","And Subu, if I can just add, in my prepared remarks today, I talked about the full year of 2014, just like at the Analyst Day, I talked about the three quarters through the end of Q3 of 2014. A similar sort of pattern as Rami mentioned happened in the fourth quarter as well. What we thought for the full year of 2014 is that the U.S. large service providers were actually down year-over-year and they were offset by growth in cable and content service providers. And that was the thing that we talked about at the Analyst Day as being an important one because what it does is that it shows not only the diversification of the revenue but also the applicability of the technology and the solutions that we\u2019re developing across multiple customer segment and that includes the Enterprise, because enterprise for the full year was pretty steady. It was actually a good performance for enterprise for the year.","So, I think that is a very big part of the leverage strategy that Rami\u2019s talked about in terms of the product portfolio that we have and also going forward in terms of growth, targeting those areas that are going faster than the rest.","Kathleen Nemeth","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brain Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Modoff","Yeah, guys. Question really on the switching side. You\u2019ve been really selling mainly top-of-rack switches, two main competitors in the spine switchovers than Cisco. I know you\u2019ve got to work in that area. When can we see a product and how you plan to target it from your go-to market strategy and that\u2019s it? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Sure. Thanks Brian. You are right. I think that the switching products that we have today limit the opportunities to very specific opportunities that we go after, where we know that we can be successful based on the capabilities of our product portfolio. We do have a programmable spine today that\u2019s very useful for certain types of cloud data centers and campus environment, this is EX9200. But that said, if the requirement is more around very dense spine switches than there the product positions that we have is the QFabric.","Now, yes, I have alluded to the fact that we are introducing more products in the switching space of this year and certainly I expect that those products are going to help us address a broader set of applications across a broader set of vertical markets, including as I just mentioned in the cloud provider space.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay. That is all the time we have this afternoon. Thank you so much for joining us today. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."],"12521":["Juniper Networks, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may now begin.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, Operator. And thanks for joining us to discuss Juniper Networks third quarter financial results and the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2015 which we announced earlier this afternoon. With me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer.","Today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper\u2019s business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, capital return program, and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today and in other documents that we filed with the SEC from time to time.","All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call.","Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP financial results. Full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information, a useful view of the company\u2019s financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today.","Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Kathleen. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter financial results call. Juniper delivered another quarter of strong financial performance with robust demand metrics and solid year-over-year earnings expansion. Our customer diversification strategy continues to yield positive results with revenue booked sequentially and year-over-year across routing switching and security.","Notably, this quarter we saw strong performance within our telecom and targeted enterprise vertical. Security was also a highlight with double-digit growth driven by our high-end SRX products. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the strong pipeline and execution across key areas of the business.","The industry is in rapid transition, moving towards cloud delivered value. This paradigm shift to the cloud is changing the way we access technology and how IT services are being delivered. In this era of massive transformation, the network is at the heart of the action. Our goal as a pure play in high-performance networking is to make sure we invest and innovate to capture this transformation as it is happening, and our customers are looking to us to support them in their evolution.","We continue to lead the industry with technology innovation. In the quarter, we know announced the new reference architecture called Juniper Networks Unite for the cloud-enabled enterprise. It demonstrates our commitment to the enterprise campus and branch segment, and our ongoing focus on IP network innovation. The new reference architecture includes our new Junos Fusion Enterprise fabric, which enables customers to simplify management of large enterprise campus network.","We also announced new security innovation that will enable sophisticated threat intelligence, prevention and dynamic policy enforcement. We are forging new alliances and partnerships that will help us drive top-line growth and market expansion. In the quarter, we extended our partnership with NEC to help provide IP transport routers to Telenor Group. We are also expanding our technology alliance ecosystem, adding Aerohive network, who will along with Ruckus and Aruba will help us deliver a simple secured and cloud managed wired and wireless solution for distributed enterprises.","Because of our clear focus on execution we are seeing some great customer product traction. Among our top customers in the quarter, our globally recognized high-tech company, and four of our top 10 are cloud or cable provider. Has our customers look to the future, they recognize Juniper\u2019s unique value proposition to deliver the ultimate in performance agility and automation and we are empowering such companies as British Airways and Telef\u00f3nica Spain to deliver world-class cloud services without compromise.","In addition, we are pleased with several new design wins at multiple leading-edge technology companies. I\u2019ll summarize some highlights this quarter across our technologies. First, I want to underscore how strategic our Contrail solution is in defining the IT and business evolution to the cloud. Customers are moving towards open-source products, software-driven automation and containers and micro services. We secured each headwinds in three major segments, Software as a Service, Public Cloud, and Telco Cloud and FBE.","Of note, AT&T was a landmark deal for us this quarter. In routing we grew 13% year-over-year. Most verticals continued to grow with solid quarter-over-quarter growth in telecom and national government. We had another record revenue quarter for both the PTX and MX series. And in Q3, adoption of some of our newest products the PTX5000, PTX1000, ATX500 accelerated.","In switching, we had another record revenue quarter for the QFX series. The QFX10000 continued to see good traction along with the QFX5100 with service providers, cloud and enterprise customers. We also saw strength in the EX family switches with enterprise, government and service provider customer.","In security, we saw our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth excluding Junos Pulse. Our security business is showing early strength in the high-end SRX with cloud and service provider customers. And branch SRX is doing low in government and managed service provider and enterprise account. We believe the combination of new threat detection capabilities and new security partnerships is a catalyst spurring our return to growth.","The course we set for ourselves is now playing out largely as we anticipated. By remaining resolute in our focus as a pure play in high-performance networking we are creating tremendous value for our customers and our shareholders. Overall, while we acknowledged that recent industry consolidation activity could create some volatility, we believe overall spending trends remains healthy.","Industry dynamics continue to unfold as we expected and our Q4 guidance incorporates our view of the macroeconomic landscape. The world needs a company like Juniper networks. We have a clear and deliberate strategy. And as a challenger in this industry, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to challenge the status quo and deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in network innovation.","I want to thank each of our employees for being critical part of this incredible journey. And thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders, who believe in our vision to empower everyone in this increasingly connected world. I remain focused on disciplined execution of our business and prudent investments for growth to realize Juniper\u2019s full potential.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Robyn to review a few highlights of the quarter.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter 2015 results reflected good year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We also demonstrated the strength of the diversity of our revenue across multiple verticals, technologies and geographies. Specifically, we saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both EMEA and APAC, as well as solid growth in the enterprise across all geography. We are pleased with the ongoing year-over-year growth and healthy underlying demand from cloud providers.","However, as we have noted this vertical can be lumpy due to the timing of deployment. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 results for routing in the Americas were positively impacted by the recognition of deferred revenue for the delivery of product and feature commitments.","In reviewing our top 10 customers, five were telcos, three which were outside of the U.S., four were cloud and cable providers, and one was an enterprise customer. We expected diversification trend to continue, demonstrating the increased relevance of our product portfolio across multiple verticals and geographies. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with the year-over-year and sequential increase in product deferred revenue and a product book-to-bill greater than one.","For the quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion which reflects our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share count. We are pleased that we delivered results in line with our long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue.","In the quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $293 million as a direct result of our accrued operating margin. CapEx for the quarter also increased to $71 million, as we focused on investments to drive long term productivity and support continued innovation and developments of new products. We repurchased $50 million of shares and paid $39 million of dividend. Through Q1 of 2014 inclusive of share repurchases and dividends we returned approximately $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders, against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q4. We expect the demand environment across multiple verticals to remain healthy and anticipate the diversification of our revenue to continue. We expect continued uncertainty around the macro-environment in China and certain parts of Europe which we have factored into our outlook.","We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong. I\u2019m very pleased with the ongoing operational discipline, including operating expense management across the company. Our new products are gaining traction with our customers, given the underlying healthy demand environment and to ensure that we capture the growth opportunities from these new products, we anticipate making modest increases to our go-to-market resources over the next few quarters, while remaining in line with our long-term model of non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue of 39%.","You can find the detailed outlook to Q4 in the CFO commentary available on our website. To summarize, I am pleased with the strong performance in Q3, including demonstrating the ability to achieve our long-term model. We anticipate overall demand to remain healthy across our target verticals and geography. We continue to see good traction with our customers, brand-new product innovations, as evidenced by new design wins and a growing pipeline.","As we close out the year, we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitment. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success. And now, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you, and congratulations to you and your team there at Juniper. A quick question, you mentioned about investing more for the future but still within your financial goals which is great. For the investing in those items can you help us a little bit more, is that focused on say geographic expansion or product expansion or certain areas like software security or certain parts that you\u2019re little softer? And also the timing of when these harvesting of these investments should start to see some growth where we should start to see some fruit from that investment? Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Yes, thanks for the question and the comments, Jim. Let me just start and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Robyn. First and foremost, as a pure-play innovator, the goal for Juniper is really to continue to make sure that we have really differentiated products in the market segments that we are going after. We have incredible product pipeline as we talked about earlier this year and it\u2019s now in the process of shipping.","And we\u2019ve also consistently said that when we invest we\u2019re going to invest in a way, in a prudent manner with discipline that\u2019s commensurate with the growth of the company. That\u2019s a discipline that Robyn and I are absolutely driving through organization right now. It\u2019s one that I think is paying off. If you just take a look at the profitability metrics in terms of operating margin and OpEx as a percentage of total revenue for the company in Q3 timeframe. And I\u2019ll pass it Robyn if you want to add anything else.","Robyn Denholm","Yes, so specifically, Jim, what I mentioned in my commentary was that we will invest modestly as we move forward here on the go-to-market side. And Rami mentioned from a product delivery point of view, we\u2019re very excited about the new products that we are delivering in to the market. We\u2019ve seen good receptivity to those products. And so we\u2019re adding prudently to the go-to-market and that to make sure that we are capturing the opportunity that\u2019s out there.","Jim Suva","Thank you, and congratulations again to you and your team.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani","Hi, just first a follow-up to the previous question. Does it mean - so you\u2019re now at an operating margin of about 25% give or take. What does it mean from a margin target that the fact you want to invest more? What does it mean for the margin target going forward? That\u2019s number one.","Number two, I want to ask more about the market itself. There was a routing cycle. You recovered from some weakness we had in previous quarters. How is - what\u2019s the outlook? Was there just a recovery from the lows? And then there is a new level and from there it goes flat, because I see it was flat sequentially this quarter. Or do you see demand, continue to creep up, go up, because of certain reasons, you can identify the reasons? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Okay. Thanks, Tal. So let me start, then I\u2019ll also hand it over to Robyn. On the margin target, I think the results that you saw in Q3 with respect to our operating margins being north of 25% and also again, our OpEx as a percentage of revenue being in line with our long term model. The long term model that we outlined to our shareholders at the end of 2014 is intact. And the results of that you see here should eventually give you confidence and it gives us a lot of confidence that we can absolutely achieve that long-term model.","That\u2019s how I would think about it. And certainly that requires a level of disciplined execution and investment that are driving through in the company today that I\u2019m honestly quite proud of how the team is executing on.","On the second question with respect to routing, the trends that we\u2019re seeing in routing in the second-half are largely playing out as we have been describing over the last several quarters. We said that there should be some improvement in telco spending in the second-half of the year. And that\u2019s essentially happening. We did see that improvement, not only in the tier 1, but also in non-tier 1 service provider.","Booking for routing, it was actually quite healthy in Q3. I think the softness was essentially is the result of cloud, difficult compared relative Q2 because of the revenue recognition to book that we had in that quarter. But visibility is solid and the product pipeline has never been this good in many, many years in the company. So I actually feel good about where we are with respect to routing. Robyn?","Robyn Denholm","Yes, I know, I think you said it well on the margin side. In terms of the percentage of revenue for OpEx we are targeting 39% of which we outlined last year and I will point out that whilst we got to the model this quarter we did get the last quarter as well from an operating margin perspective. There is still a lot of work to be done to get there on a sustainable basis and an annualized basis. So I think we\u2019ll have the next question. Manny, can you\u2026","Operator","Excuse me. Yes, the next is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski","Hi, thanks very much. Rami, you commented on the recent industry consolidation, but then you also made a comment that the world needs a company like Juniper. I was just curious, was that a reference to a preference you have to remain standalone versus participating in the consolidation? And then, I have a follow-up.","Rami Rahim","Okay. Thanks for the question, Simona. You look at the industry right now, certainly, there are examples of consolidation, there is at least one example where the exact opposite of a split is in fact happening. But these things that I want everybody to be aware of is the massive transformation that\u2019s just happening in terms of technology, in terms a new approach in that service providers and enterprises are using to deliver value to their end user, that requires things like virtualization, requires things like automation and visibility and analytics. And that in my mind requires that there would be somebody that\u2019s absolutely focused on innovation in the space of IP networking.","And I believe that\u2019s the role that we satisfy in this industry, as I go around the world and I talk to our customer CIO, CTO, CEO they all have the common theme in terms of requirements, which is a technology provider that can partner with them to offer a new way for them to deliver services and values to their end users. And they view us as that right partner that\u2019s I think the role that we satisfy.","Simona Jankowski","Thank you. And then just a follow-up question which is to with your MX product, which has been very successful over the years. Some of your competitors physical there has been others are talking about addressing some of the routing features in the routing stack, and then aggregated fashion on the switching platforms in the data center. And I think you guys are considering or working on doing something similar, but can you just address how that developments are might impinge on the opportunity for the MX and whether that\u2019s kind of holistic whether you do it to yourselves or others do it to you?","Rami Rahim","Sure. Thanks for the question Simona. So, the MX success is a result of a few different things that one of the biggest elements of the success has to do with the diversity of used cases that is satisfied, it really has turned into the standard Swiss Army knife, if you will, for this industry or has the ability to deliver all sorts of services whether it be business or residential or to serve at the edge of the data center connecting data centers together or connecting data centers to the consumer of cloud services. I think it\u2019s very difficult for anybody to target the MX it is entirety with all of the used cases that it serves the flexibility that we built round up from the start to make it very competitive.","Now, let\u2019s said, I\u2019m not confused about the fact that this industry is a competitive industry and we have to innovate in that way. Yes, I do believe that there will be competition that will go after specific used cases that the MX does target. And in that case we either show and demonstrate the flexibility of the MX in solving that used case in a better way or we do have options ourselves with other products that we can use in our portfolio, whether it would be the PTX or the new QFX10000, that can solve in particular used case in a more efficient manner.","So, I think about it from a standpoint of, yes, the industry is competitive. We now have a diverse future between the MX, the PTX and the QFX that give us all of the weapons that we need to compete effectively.","Simona Jankowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of J.P. Morgan, please go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yes, thanks for the question. I just wanted to focus a little bit more on switching the numbers better than we expected momentum that continues yet, what are other data points out there pointing to enterprise in many regions. I just wonder Rob, could you just comment on where we are with the major projects that you guys are seeing and switching or implementing and have you added more of those projects that was allowing it\u2019s about trend and then I got a follow-up.","Rami Rahim","Sure Rod. In switching I think the strength was broad-based and there we saw a good diversity of business across both the service provider and the enterprise. We also saw healthy demands for switching around the world which certainly help. And when you think about switching, for us it really comes down to cloud. There is a consistency across pretty much all of our market verticals.","In the enterprise, there is a Cloud-First Mentality, where CIOs are looking to move workloads and applications to the clouds and the service provider segment and the cable provider segment they are looking at delivering more value to end users through cloud-based architectures. I think our switching, routing and security portfolios are coming together under the mega fabric architecture framework in a way that\u2019s really resonating with our customers.","And the roadmap with the new set of spine switches that were in the process of shipping into the market today is looking very solid in the eyes of our customers. I think I\u2019m bullish on the long-term prospects we\u2019re switching given, all of these trends and because of the differentiation that we have in our product portfolio.","Robyn Denholm","You had a follow-up Rod? Hi Manny, or Rod are you there?","Operator","Yes. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Robyn Denholm","Okay. Manny, after Pierre, you could put Rod back into his follow-up.","Pierre Ferragu","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I would want to ask many questions, you\u2019ve been doing so great on so many dimensions. So, maybe I would just restricted to switching and security. In switching, because to know if how like the ramp up of your product to high density spine QFX switch is doing and how much it has an impact in numbers this quarter. And if we should expect some website from this product trend, but only one or two quarter horizon.","And then on the security so impressive to see SRX platform doing so well at the moment. And it would be curious to know, where are you winning with the platform at the moment and how are you replacing like nagging, in the broad-based that you had out there, so is that the product cycle are you winning this, are you displacing competitors that would be very good to know that. And then, almost everybody asked you that. I can\u2019t helping us one more question on, how we should think about that going forward. Would that be fair to think that you guys whatever - whichever we think it\u2019s happened going forward, I probably not going to grow your cost basedin the OpEx based on your revenues, is that the fair statement. And sorry for the embarrassing question.","Robyn Denholm","That\u2019s okay. Yes. Let me handle the last one first, and then Rami will talk about switching and security. So, on the cost side absolutely we are focused on the discipline around cost management that we\u2019ve shine over the last few years. And we are very focusedon making sure that we only add modest amount of costs. The increase between Q3 and Q4 again to meet point of 500 plus or minus in terms of OpEx. The majority of that increase quarter-over-quarter the vast majority is actually variable cost. So, what we\u2019re talking about is modest increase as we now go to market we\u2019re very focused on delivering the leverage in the model as we believe is there in lying with our long-term model.","Robyn Denholm","This is great, thanks.","Pierre Ferragu","Thank you.","Rami Rahim","And, hi, Pierre. Let me touch on switching and security. So, in the spine switches we\u2019ve now shift the first version of the family of new QFX10000 spine switches, we anticipate that we\u2019ll get the second version now into our customers hand before the end of the year. The traction that we\u2019re seeing is solid, I think that these products have been now in our customers lapse for some time and we\u2019re getting feedbacks and we are eventually putting to finishing touches on those products.","I will say that the team really pushed the limits of technology developing these products and we did with the hope and the anticipation that we will have some two differentiation and it\u2019s playing out exactly as we have predicted in terms of our differentiation relative to net sales in the market and I feel very good about that. All that being said, we have consistently set the modest revenue in the second-half of this year and that\u2019s how I would think about it with the growth really starting to happen next year.","On the security side, if you recall earlier in the year, we talked about our security pivot, we talked about reaching synergies from the standpoint of technology and cost as well as revenue, we talked about switch and security is being instrumentally tight to the network. And the initial focus for us was on the high-end. If we offer a cloud network or a campus network to our customers, we want them to have the peace of mind that it will be resilient, it will be high quality, it will be resilient to attached from that guide. And that means that you should be able to secure the network, with that\u2019s flowing it down. So with the initial focus on the high-end I think we\u2019ve increased the confidence in the eyes of our customers, we\u2019ve improved the performance of the product lines dramatically it\u2019s now effect the high endis directed the fastest firewallin the industry. And so for certain used cases around the edge of the cloud in service provider and mobile infrastructure. We really have to differentiate the products and we\u2019re starting to see the effect of that. That said, I am not yet calling machine accomplished on security, we\u2019ve said that 2015 will be in the year of stability and we\u2019ve still a lot of work quite frankly for us to do to shore up the rest of the product portfolio especially if it comes to the enterprise and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re focused on right now. So, pleased with what we\u2019ve done so far a lot more work for us to do.","Robyn Denholm","Yes. And just, I\u2019ve added to that is, we\u2019ve said a numerous times this year is a year of stabilizing the security business year-to-date we are flat with 2014 obviously, we have to grow that business next year but with place with the progress today and I just wanted to forward that ground we do a specific question here, we will grow revenues faster than OpEx as we move forward that was part of our guidance when we set the long-term model last year. So, I just wanted to require on that.","Pierre Ferragu","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. With that, we\u2019ll turn to Rod Hall for his follow-up question.","Rod Hall","Yes, thanks for coming back to me. Can you hear me okay?","Rami Rahim","Yes.","Robyn Denholm","Yes. Go ahead.","Rod Hall","So, If I\u2019m just going to ask about the routing business and one of you guys can comment on what you think happened to your share this quarter in market share and also on the Contrail, on AT&T which by the way congratulations on that. I just wonder if you could maybe give us a little idea what the revenue opportunity that might look like what sorts of products that might pull through, thanks.","Rami Rahim","Sure, Rod. On market share I don\u2019t think all of the reports are collect, yet, but these share reports you have to look at them and dissect them into different areas. I think in the edge based on the wins and the project that we\u2019ve been executing on there is a large dynamic that\u2019s happening around the world especially here in the US and in EMEA for edge modernization and consolidation simplification of edge architectures. And just based on the project activity I believe that we\u2019re doing quite well.","In the core, I think it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time for us as we go through the transition from T Series to the next generation of the PTX that we\u2019re shipping this year that we\u2019ve lost in the early part of this year. So, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen there with respect to our share, but I feel good about the roadmap and the focus in terms of the prospects for share gains going forward into next year.","On Contrail yes you pointed out one of the wins that we are very proud of and that is with AT&T, but let me say that pretty much every strategic discussion that we\u2019re having with our customers around the world especially on the service provider side, but also in some larger enterprises that are looking at transforming the way in which they manage their networks to simplify the operations of those networks and to add far greater agility in how they deliver services over those networks. They are thinking about a new architectural approach and Contrail is part of that discussion.","So, we added four new paying customers, I think the engagements have expanded the developer community for the open source Contrail project is only growing the amount of innovation that\u2019s not coming not just from Juniper, but from our partners around the industry is also growing, I\u2019m really proud of what the Contrail team has done and continuous to do. And AT&T certainly who extremely created that project, but I think that\u2019s just an example of others that were also engaging in.","Rod Hall","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo, please go ahead.","Jess Lubert","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on another nice quarter here. First, I would hope you could tell us of getting 10% customers in the period and if so what category they would fall into. And then secondly, in Europe of course like your Carrier business is fairly strong so, it\u2019s helping to understand that was driven by a handful of large deals that would tail-off after a quarter or two, where that was driven by a larger number of transactions that might be more sustainable and then perhaps you could provide an update on the Nokia partnership how that\u2019s proceeding, how confident you are in your ability to navigate any disruption once that deal is closed? Thanks.","Robyn Denholm","Yes. So, Jess, in terms of 10% customers there were no 10% customers in the quarter. Again, part of the strength of this quarter was actually the diversification of revenue in the quarter again with enterprise actually being quite strong, telco being quite strong, and obviously, a sequential decline but still very healthy year-over-year growth in the cloud providers and cable area. So, I\u2019ll let Rami talk through the EMEA service provider business.","Rami Rahim","Sure. So, in Europe actually the strength was fairly broad-based, it was with both on the service provider, the key or the tier 1 telecom operators, but also in the enterprises and particularly government. So, actually I\u2019m pretty pleased with the broad-based strength of the business, there are certainly large deals in the SP space. There are typically going to be large deals that drive the overall performance, but I don\u2019t think there is anything that\u2019s atypical if you will in the quarter.","And then I will say that the project that we\u2019re engaging in are really around a number of key used cases edge modernization in particular such as for example the announcement that we made recently with Telefonica Spain seems to be a really key scene in that region, I think operators are looking to streamline their networks and deliver more value with great agility over this networks and for that you need a universal edge type product and the MX satisfies that role quite naturally. On the Nokia, I think we\u2019re executing towards strategy and the plan that we outlined in the last earnings call. We have enjoyed deep relationship with all of our customers around the world and where there is a need to make a change in our total market approach we\u2019re doing that and we\u2019re doing it to a schedule that I think is working very well for us, so no concerns on that forefront.","Jess Lubert","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian White with Drexel. Please go ahead.","Brian White","Yes, Rami. I wonder if you could comment a little about this product cycle we\u2019re ramping up this year, but if you had to provide us with an idea where we are in the revenue generation from this product cycle that would be great in terms of what percentage we are the way through and just the AT&T win for the carriers often define networking maybe just a little more color on why Juniper was chosen and does this categorize existing business or net-net this is incremental for Juniper? Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Yes, thanks Brian. On the product cycle and I\u2019m assuming here you\u2019re talking about the newer product that we\u2019re introducing market across routing, switching and security it\u2019s still early stages we\u2019re consistently in that second-half, we\u2019ll see modest revenue on the routing side, we haven\u2019t yet shift the enhancements to the PTX product lines we\u2019re very excited about. I think the growth really started to happen in a meaningful way in 2016 and the early customer interest gave us confidence of these products of hitting the mark in terms of the challenges that they solve for our customers.","On AT&T a couple of different projects that have been announced one, is that we are participating in AT&T network on demand initiative. We\u2019re doing this especially we\u2019re offering, we\u2019re partnering with them to offer to end users, enterprises. And you weigh the rising value from their networks that gives far more flexibility into the hands of the customer itself. So, they will have the ability to choose on-demand the kinds of services that they want AT&T to deliver to them and it\u2019s a very soft or eccentric approach to market that has traditionally been driven by hardware and complexity.","And we want it quite frankly because we have challenged the ways in which these solutions were delivered historically. We had actually little to nothing to lose, because it\u2019s essentially a net new market opportunity for Juniper. And so, we\u2019ve demonstrated to AT&T that we are a very willing partnered in that technology transformation and we\u2019re delighted that we were successful.","And the second project is really around the very strategic network control-point, this being Contrail, that will provide the network automation in their next-generation central offices. This is where I provided the commentary that this is just an example of the types of engagements we are having with service providers around the world. The fact is that SP\u2019s are really looking to a new approach to running their next-generation network facilities and delivering values from this facilities and the network controllers at barrister to control point in the new architecture and contrail and the traction it\u2019s seeing is a big that\u2019s very encouraging to us.","Operator","The next question us from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Sanjiv Wadhwani","Rami I had a question about growth, a year ago at the analyst day you had talked about 3% to 6% three year growth rate and understanding it might fluctuate in any given year. Wondering if you could comment next year might be a typical year fall within that range and how some of your new products that really ramping next year might help out in terms of growth rate next year. Thanks.","Rami Rahim","We are just going to stick it will be provided you at the end of 2014 in terms of the three your view. Certainly the results that we\u2019re seeing this year give us the confidence that we can achieve that three year view in terms of growth. I think the fundamentals of the industry are solid. I think the spending environment is good. The product roadmap is healthy and you know all of those factors come together to give me the confidence in our ability to actually achieve the growth targets that we provided you.","Robyn Denholm","We will provide you with some color into next year as we round out this year. In terms of what we\u2019re expecting from a growth rate perspective.","Sanjiv Wadhwani","I guess just a quick follow up. When you look at the new products, do you think that could add to some dimension in growth? Just given that starting to ramp next year? Just qualitatively, not just in terms of the actual addition or subtraction in numbers?","Robyn Denholm","Yes. As we\u2019ve been saying consistently, our new product revenue for the products we announced earlier this year in March, will contribute very modestly to revenue in 2015. We expect revenue growth for next year to be more substantial.","Operator","The next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James Faucette","I wanted to ask a similar question. If we go back to last year, last fall you are kind of outlining your growth targets, one of the key tenants that you focused on was the eventual need for carriers to increase their spending, particularly on core as core capacity was exhausted. At the same time as we fast forward to this year, service provider spending at least among the U.S. is still been relatively flat without seeing much improvement there. I\u2019m wondering if you can give a little bit of color what maybe allowing the carriers in the U.S. o do that? And secondly, as they do start to increase their spend, how much of an additional tailwind can this be. It seems like with the good growth you\u2019ve seen with the U.S. Tier 1 the kicking in, perhaps can be an accelerator and then similarly, on security you\u2019re delivering good year-over-year growth in that line in spite of the fact that you\u2019re characterizing it as a 2015 as a stabilization. So if that\u2019s the case we expect to see further acceleration in security in 2016 as you turn the corner and start to enter into what you think to be true growth. Thanks.","Rami Rahim","There\u2019s a lot in there I\u2019m going to see if I can address at all. First in terms of carrier spending. As I mentioned things are largely playing out as we expected in the second half and I expect the next quarter, Q4 also be a good quarter to also be a good quarter for us in terms of carrier spending. The dynamics between core and edge actually I\u2019ve been consistently saying it\u2019s become very difficult to break out those two domains. Much of the pressure that\u2019s happening in telecom networks today is in fact happening in the metro, it\u2019s happening in the edge and a lot of the product that have traditionally been used or deployed in the core are now actually going in the edge to deal with that tropic capacity.","So I\u2019m really more measuring our success in carrier routing from overall routing standpoint as opposed to specific to one domain or the other. That said, despite the fact that we\u2019re seeing some improvement in telcos we are not counting on that alone in driving our overall revenue growth, we are counting on continued diversity in our business. We saw that play out in the last couple of quarters with cloud kicking in to help some weakness in carrier spending. We\u2019re seeing it now this quarter with diversity across the enterprise, government, and different geos, all of that is kicking in to support the overall growth.","And it really then demonstrates the power of that strategy to diversify our business from a technology standpoint, from a market vertical standpoint and also from a geo standpoint. On security, again this year is all about stability as Robyn mentioned essentially we are flat year-to-date. We still have I feel very good on where the work that has been done thus far on shoring up our competitiveness in the service provider high-end security space and in the cloud. We still have some more work to do on the enterprise side and just in Q3, we announced a series of enhancements to our security portfolio under the umbrella of a new architecture called Juniper Unite. That essentially brings to bear our security switching and routing assets together to create far more agility, simplicity and ease of management that\u2019s so important to our enterprise customers in the campus and in the canvas domain and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on right now and I think that plays out in resulting growth in 2016 timeframe.","Robyn Denholm","Let me just added to the first part of your question, James. On telco we actually saw good growth in the quarter both sequentially and year-over-year and globally, modestly in the U.S. but globally it was a nice quarter for growth. So we\u2019re actually anticipating that diversification to continue and we are expecting that to continue to improve again modestly.","Operator","The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder Garcha","I guess it\u2019s for Rami and a lots been [indiscernible] call about diversifying your revenue base versus the charts that we saw last year, this update on how some diversified you are now? And if you can\u2019t get some of those numbers may be can you help us with the [Technical Difficulty] comfortable whereby Juniper could see through cycle revenue growth well it continues and you could offset on a continuous basis the typical service provider cycle that we see? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","I know that data that we had provided has been very useful and I think we can look to provide an updated view in the future. From just a qualitative standpoint, the strategy itself is definitely working out in terms of helping us offset what is in fact a cyclical industry. Do we believe that we can completely offset large cycles that might happen in telcos? No. I think that\u2019s a pretty tall order but that said I think we\u2019ve demonstrated with not just a diversity from a market vertical standpoint but diversity across the technology areas, switching routing securities and diversity across geos. I mean you look at Q3, enterprise kicked in and also EMEA and APAC kicked in that helped us in again, creating the overall growth. I think the strategy works. I think it has legs and I think that it will help us in the future.","Kulbinder Garcha","[Technical Difficulty]. And maybe just one very quick. There\u2019s a question I want to ask about the question from the Juniper perspective it seems to me that you guys are hitting most of the targets were heading toward most of the targets you want. The ones I have always been question about is and given that you are achieving your working structure generating good cash return returning cash growing without the time that Juniper on the M&A do think maybe accelerate some of your growth or is that how you see the business?","Rami Rahim","Yes. I\u2019m actually open to M&A and it will be as I said mentioned historically very much complementary to our strategy. Tuck-in type technology M&A\u2019s that will be easy to integrate and work to accelerate the strategy that we are already executing on. Having said that, we are so focused right now on putting the finishing touches on what is a huge product pipeline that\u2019s all coming to bear into the market simultaneously around the same time frame I honestly do not want to distract the team too much from that right now. So timing is going to be important, but that said, I do believe that M&A can be a good part of our strategy with the right timing and certainly something that\u2019s complimentary to our overall strategy.","Operator","Next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Sue","Robyn I think on the cost side you should just go spend the money so please go ahead. As it relates to the tech competitors some are moving quickly to combined a stack converge and seeing some hyper converge. Are there platform changes your customers are asking you to make or is it still about combining discrete assets of switching, routing, contrail, just trying to get a understanding of the long tail migration opportunity with your current product set and how you might see clean page data centers being deployed.","Rami Rahim","I will say you\u2019re actually hitting on a topic, it\u2019s very important to me and to my leadership team. Today the growth that we\u2019ve seen with Juniper products in the cloud have largely been as a result of companies, enterprises, telcos, cloud providers that have the ability to choose best of breed and to combine them themselves in ways that solved the business challenges that they face. That said, there is a part of the marketing segment of the market, the value out-of-the-box converged architectures that include compute storage, networking and the software automations stack on top of that.","We have in fact been working with a number of different partners so we probably have around half dozen right now, regional partners that are working with Juniper as well as storage providers and compute providers to build those converged stack offerings. They typically are very targeted to specific market verticals so some might be targeted towards healthcare, others toward retail and it\u2019s still early days. These are relatively new product offerings, but I actually I feel pretty confident in their ability to at least give us some access to that converged or hyper converged market.","Mark Sue","And can we assume that Juniper is resorting back to the practice of not revealing products that might actually already are being tested by some of your customers?","Rami Rahim","Sorry the question was not revealing are not reviewing?","Robyn Denholm","The practice of not announcing products before they are scheduled to be shipped","Rami Rahim","I see what you\u2019re saying. I think there is a balance here. The practice of revealing products years in advance of ship I say yes, that\u2019s something that is well behind us. We certainly will announce within a certain reasonable timeframe like a couple of quarters type of timeframe. And I think there is value in doing that because what you do is you prime the market. You get it ready for adoption but we are very careful in not revealing our cards if you will too early. That said, there is always a lot of deep dialogue and engagement under NDA with our customers where we\u2019re not only revealing the products but we\u2019re actually making them stakeholders in the developments of those products and making sure that those products satisfy their specific requirements.","Operator","Next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Ittai Kidron","I had a couple questions. First looking at your enterprise business, this is the first quarter in five, after five quarters, where you had year-over-year declines in your enterprise business that you actually had a positive year-over-year growth in the enterprise. So Rami it will be great to get some color as to how much of this is sort of a little bit of reversion to the mean after five back quarters versus your confidence in them, more sustainable result out of that business and I\u2019d like to apply that question as well to your security business. Clearly you have had two very good quarters, I\u2019m wondering how much of it is just a reflection of the fact that clients have been sitting on the sidelines now that you have refreshed a product that are kind of updating architectures versus their true new wins, new customer additions here. So if you could give some color in the security, how much of the progress here is on your existing install base versus adding new customers that would be great. And then for you, Robyn, just as we think about that next year, can you help us think about how to think about March quarter\u2019s [indiscernible] and also pro forma tax rate for 2016. Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Sure. Let me start. First on the enterprise. I am certainly pleased with the performance. Three reason, cloud, cloud, and cloud are essentially why we\u2019re seeing this success that we are seeing in the enterprise. There\u2019s been a lot of focus on targeting enterprises and service providers that are building out cloud architectures and the product portfolio that go to market focus the support infrastructure we have in place is all geared towards tapping into that segment. And it is a growing segment.","At the end of the day while switching for example is a huge total addressable market, the cloud element of it is the part that\u2019s in fact growing and we want to tap into that and we have been able to tap into that. It has been also just a big focus for me personally as part of the strategic initiative that I\u2019ve laid out this year from the standpoint of partnerships. Creating the partnerships and the commercial engine that we need to tap into the overall enterprise opportunity specifically as it relates to the cloud.","In security, it really is a combination, in fact there has been a few notable wins in the last couple of quarters that are net new. Having said that, I think there are also customers that have traditionally liked the SRX, especially the high-end SRX and the branch SRX that we are tapping into that need to modernize their infrastructure and we\u2019re tapping into that as well. Again, we are not calling mission accomplished yet in security. There is a lot more work to do and there might be a couple of gyrations here and there as we get to overall long-term growth which happens next year.","Robyn Denholm","And I think the other area on the enterprise that\u2019s also we\u2019re focusing on the channel as well. Using a lot of the enterprise wins that we\u2019ve been developing ourselves in terms of both the cloud area that Rami mentioned as well as in the security side to reinvigorate the channel and put design wins and that type of thing with them so that we can enable the channel to replicate them. Ittai you asked two questions. One to me, one was on the tax rate, what was the other question?","Ittai Kidron","How should we think about seasonality heading into the March quarter?","Robyn Denholm","Okay. So let me talk about seasonality. At this point it\u2019s obviously early. We\u2019ll give you more color next quarter\u2019s call but we\u2019re not anticipating anything outside of the normal seasonality that we would see between Q4 and Q1. So typically we see a reduction somewhere between 7% and 10%, that type of thing. So we\u2019re not expecting at this point anything different to that. We\u2019ll give you an update on that on the next call. In terms of the tax rate, there was a lot of excitement in the tax rate commentary this quarter which is not usual. So on the pro forma GAAP tax rate, we will expect a slightly reduced rate. Obviously the R&D tax credit is not being renewed has had an increase in our tax rate overall for the year. If that gets renewed that can have close to 2% tax rate adjustment. So at this point we wouldn\u2019t see a significantly different tax rate for next year except for the addition of the R&D tax credit.","Operator","The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","I took out coverage of group from Brian, so looking forward to working with you and your team. My question is really on the sustainability and visibility of the order flow in cloud and cable. Honestly I would like to ask a question in terms of that segment has been doing well for you, cloud and cable providers you also mentioned SaaS etcetera. So are these one-offs kind of a near-term order flow, do you see sustainability from a use case point of view that this could kind of extend over a multiple quarters and then the a quick follow-on to that would be on the service provider routing side. You had the routing business, is this is expectations in Q3 is flattish. [Indiscernible] so give us kind of your view of the order commentary there in routing heading into Q4 and into over the next few quarters. Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Let me start and I\u2019ll see if Robyn has anything to add. Cloud and cable, I think those verticals have had lumpiness historically and I\u2019m not let\u2019s say concerned about the relative weakness that we had sequentially in cloud in Q3. If you look at the year-over-year it\u2019s actually quite healthy growth. Very healthy growth in fact. When I look at the fundamentals of cloud, the need to build efficient wide-area networks to connect the data centers together to connect the data centers to the consumers of cloud services to peer endpoint is all absolutely there and I don\u2019t anticipate that changing so long-term trajectory for this vertical, the cost vertical I believe is actually healthy and the products that we\u2019re building with the specific capabilities for this vertical the capabilities in terms of visibility and manageability, controllability are well understood by Juniper and we\u2019re developing our products with the intent of capturing the cloud opportunity in the future. Cable as well can be lumpy, it has been lumpy historically.","I think there is consolidation that\u2019s happening in the cable industry that will result in some short-term uncertainty if you will, but the long-term prospects for us in cable I think are quite good. I see routing all up, I think as I mentioned I feel actually quite good about where we are with respect to routing. Bookings were strong, I think the sequential softness in Q3 in North America specifically had to do with timing of projects, a difficult compare relative to Q2 with the revenue recognition event that we had in Q2 that we talked to you about. Visibility is good and the roadmap is excellent.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you so much. Thank you Vijay, and I want to thank each of you for your great questions and your interest in Juniper Networks. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s tele-conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

We delivered a solid financial performance for the second quarter of 2016, as we navigated through a challenging macro environment. Total revenue was $1.221 billion, stronger than the outlook we provided, and up sequentially across all geographies, technologies and sectors.","Services revenue was again solid, up 11% year over year, and 4% sequentially. We also delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, with operating income up 37%, operating margin up 3 points, and diluted EPS up 57% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was up 30%, operating margin was up 3 points and diluted EPS was up 35%. I'm proud of the disciplined execution from our team, and as we look ahead, I remain confident that our strategy and differentiated portfolio will enable us to achieve our long-term targets.","I'll talk a bit about the progress we are making with our highly focused strategy to be the worldwide leader of network innovation. From a technology perspective, our agenda is focused on two important dimensions. The first is scale and performance, and the second is automation through software innovations.","On the dimension of automation, we believe it is the key attribute required for our customers to achieve vast new levels of agility and efficiency in delivering services over their networks. Automation is fundamental not just to Juniper but to the health of our entire industry, and it is the most important attribute of our newly announced cloud-enabled brand solution, which we believe will allow enterprises and managed service providers alike to deliver on-demand cloud services seamlessly.","A critical technology element of our cloud-enabled brand solution is Contrail, a powerful tool for network virtualization and automation that is enabling our customers' IT and business evolution to the cloud. In both the Enterprise and Service Provider sectors, we already have multiple multi-million dollar Contrail deployment.","We see many unique opportunities and growth drivers for Contrail. One of the most interesting and forward-looking use cases pertains to the Internet of Things, enabling virtualized and secure connectivity to vast numbers of connected devices. For example, a Tier 1 telco has deployed Contrail for its energy (4:52) platform that not only virtualizes many of its networking applications, but also enables at-scale deployment of connected car services, such as real time mapping, traffic, news and music streaming. Similarly, we have also been in production for over a year now with a large industrial conglomerate whose industrial Internet allows it and its partners to perform data mining and data collection from various machines like wind turbines, jet engines, elevators and MRI scanners.","We are also seeing increased momentum with managed service providers, leveraging our open platforms for SDN and NFV. We believe we are in a unique position to help them achieve new levels of agility and cost optimization, and offer their enterprise customers best of breed technology choices without the complexity that typically comes from managing multi-vendor solutions.","Some great examples of our momentum include Verizon, which selected our cloud CPE solution as the foundational platform for its virtual network services; Orange Business Services, which is now using our Contrail SDN controller for its easy go network as a service offering; and AT&T, which is offering Juniper's virtual routing function as an option for its enterprise customers looking for on-demand virtualized network services.","The scale and performance of Routing, Switching and Security continue to be of fundamental importance to our customers who are constantly trying to stay ahead of network traffic growth, and trying to do so economically. Innovating in this dimension has been our hallmark since the inception of this company, with the breakthrough products like the M40, the MX and the PTX that over the years have redefined the economics of networking.","As bandwidth intensive applications continue to soar, and the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the need to continue to innovate in the dimension of scale and performance is only increasing in time. And we also believe there is still plenty of room for that innovation both in systems and in intelligent software that enables more efficient use of network capacity. To that end, we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with our NorthStar controller, that optimizes across both packet and optical domains dynamically and in real time, unlocking new levels of capacity in our customers' networks.","Technology is only part of the challenge in any network transformation. Having the right skills is as big if not a bigger challenge. That's why we've recently announced the expansion of our successful open lab program with six new locations across North America, Europe and Asia, which will provide customers and partners with a range of resources to build and learn about emerging virtualization and automation technologies.","Now, moving on, I'd like to comment on our Routing, Switching, and Security business this quarter. In Routing, we are very pleased with the diversification across geographies, verticals, and product mix. Many customers are enthusiastically embracing our newest MX and PTX products. Our PTX line grew sequentially and year over year to reach record revenue with core network deployments across our cloud, telco, and cable customers. As our customers migrate from 10 gig to 100 gig connections, we believe our technology leadership in both the core and Edge Network layers gives us a clear, competitive advantage to gain market share.","In Switching, we saw strength in the data center across telco, cable, cloud provider, hosting, and enterprise customers. Our QFX 10,000 family of spine switches is ramping well, and we see a solid pipeline in the second half of the year.","In Security, we did experience another difficult quarter as we continue to work hard to turn around this component of our business. As I've said before, our strategy and product transitions are going to take time to play out, and will result in some lumpiness in the business. We remain committed to developing and delivering to our customers complete and differentiated domain-level solutions for the cloud, SB mobile, and enterprise networks that include elements of Routing, Switching, and Security all working tightly together.","We are operating in a difficult macro environment that has been affected by recent economic and geopolitical volatility. However, we remain focused on what we can control, and believe that solid execution, coupled with a strong portfolio of solutions, will position us to navigate through effects on spending patterns in the future. We are continuing to make balanced decisions between growth and profitability, while making investments that best position us to address our customers' most critical networking needs.","We remain focused on driving long-term sustainable growth, while generating strong cash flow. And we continue to focus on managing our business prudently, while strengthening our investments in scale, performance and automation through software innovation. I want to thank our customers, partners, and employees for their continuing dedication as we move along our journey. Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continuing support and investment.","Now, I'll turn it over to Ken for his comments.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter results reflect strong sequential revenue and earnings growth. Sequentially, revenue grew across all technologies, geographies and markets. Enterprise growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter was driven by improved spending patterns following a cautious Q1. Service Provider revenue grew 6% sequentially, primarily driven by telecom deployments and an increase in revenue from cloud providers. Our services business continued to be strong, with solid growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.","In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were telecoms, four were cloud or cable providers, and one was in Enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than 1.0, and a strong increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially.","In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $354 million, up $91 million year-over-year, and up $182 million sequentially. We repurchased $126 million of shares, and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.91 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.","While I'm pleased with the overall results, the macro environment in Q2 was more challenging than we originally anticipated, and gross margins came in below our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margins were 63%, down 0.7% sequentially. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by elevated pricing pressure, primarily in EMEA, as well as product mix. This was partially offset by improvements in our cost structure.","While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline.","Now moving on to Q3 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We remain constructive on revenue for 2016 and expect modest growth despite the current macro environment. We will continue to prudently manage our operating expenses. However, we expect gross margins to remain approximately at their Q2 levels in the near term. As a result, we expect operating margins for the full year 2016 to decline slightly, relative to the full year of 2015.","We are confident in our long-term model and remain focused on growth and operating margin expansion. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.","And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. . And our first question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good evening, and thank you for taking my question. I'd like to focus, of course, on the gross margin surprise which we saw in the quarter and what you're planning for coming quarters. So, you mentioned mix and pricing pressure. On the latter, I'd like to know where the pricing pressure is coming from. Are you suffering from currency? Are you forced to give discounts to secure business with clients to \u2013 who are having a harder time defending their budgets? Or are you actually facing competitors with more aggressive pricing?","And then on the former, on the mix shift, if you could give us a bit of color on what kind of mix, what are like the higher margin products that are less in the mix today and what are the lower margin products that are more in the mix today? That would be great. Thank you very much.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, thanks, Pierre. I'll start and then I'll pass it on to Ken to provide some additional details. With respect to gross margins, it's more of the latter thing that you discussed, okay? This is more around the macro concerns in Europe in particular, and that is primarily a result of foreign exchange. So, something we had been thinking about and monitoring closely in order to offset the dollar exchange, weaker Euro, additional discounting was something that we had thought was necessary, and we're seeing it play out. And then there is, yes, this secondary component, which is product mix.","I just want to say two additional things before I pass it on to Ken. First is, I think we demonstrated in Q2 that despite the fact that we saw weaker than expected gross margins, we were able to tightly control our operating expenses to protect our operating margin. So, I'm proud of the discipline that we saw in terms of execution from the team and you can expect more of that going forward.","And the second thing is as we look at the innovation of our products across all of our portfolio of products, and that includes the new products that we're introducing into the market now, one of the things that we've always focused on and we will continue to focus on is the innovation that goes into reduction of the COGS, the cost of goods sold per bit per second \u2013 of Routing, Switching, and Security. And I view that as something that would be helpful certainly as a tailwind in the future as we see those products ramp up. Ken?","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great, yeah. Rami, I think you covered the elevated pricing pressure in EMEA pretty well. I'll touch on the product mix. So, an example of that that we saw in Q2 was the BTI acquisition. Although we expect the acquisition to result in neutral earnings for the year, it did have a slight negative impact to both gross margin and operating margin in the second quarter. The \u2013 an example \u2013 the product mix that hit us in Q2. In addition to that, there's a lot of different product mix contributors whether it be chassis versus line cards, our percentage of software. So, product mix could result in either headwinds or tailwinds. At this point I think it's \u2013 we're definitely not giving up on our long-term model of 64%. We're focused on delivering innovation and continuing our cost structure improvements and we'll go forward from here.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Now our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. I was hoping you could help us understand how much the improvement in the Switching business was driven by the uptake of the new QFX 10K platforms and which verticals you're seeing the greatest demand for these products. And then, to what degree you'd expect to see uptake of the 10K drive further sequential improvement as we move to the second half of the year? And then I have a follow-up.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, thanks, Jess, for the question. So, needless to say, we're really pleased with the performance of our Switching business all up in Q2. We saw double-digit growth both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. I think what we're seeing here is this strategy of focusing very deliberately on data centers and cloud buildouts pay off for us. In terms of verticals, strength in telcos, in cloud, and especially Q2 we saw a strong government sector as well, play out for us nicely.","We have said consistently that the new products \u2013 the spine switches, the 10K switches \u2013 are mostly going to contribute to revenue in the second half, and that remains the case. There's certainly some orders and early revenue that came in in Q2 timeframe, but right now, I would characterize the situation we're in as we're competing aggressively for net new wins, new opportunities. And the nice thing that I'm observing now is that we are able to compete in opportunities that we were never able to compete in historically because of the lack of having this important part of the end-to-end Switching portfolio.","Last thing I'll just say is there are some transitions that are happening in the data center space, as our customers go from 10gig and 40gig to 25gig and 100gig. I think that plays out nicely because at the end of the day, these data centers are essentially becoming high performance networking problems that are Layer 3 in nature. That's exactly the kind of really high performance problems that I think Juniper loves to solve.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then Rami, I was hoping you could touch on the potential impact from Jericho-based Routing products, particularly in the cloud vertical and perhaps to what extent you view more advanced Layer 3 switches is a threat to your Edge Routing business, and should we expect you guys to more directly address this market later this year or next?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, certainly it's a question that has come up. I think at the end of the day, the thing that matters the most to our customers, across all verticals, including the cloud vertical, are the capabilities of the products and the solutions themselves \u2013 from the standpoint of flexibility, Layer 3 stack capabilities, the density in performance, the price per port, et cetera. And I will just say that I am very comfortable with where we are today based on the technology decision that we have made historically that includes silicon decisions.","And if you recall what I had mentioned in our last analyst event, I sort of categorized the market in three distinct buckets. There are those that care about very flexible Routing with a lot of features and a lot of flexibility and programmability; those that care more about WAN transport \u2013 wide area network transport efficiency; and those that care about cost efficiency as it pertains to Switching. And I don't think that we have ever been this strong across all three of those domains today with our product portfolio.","Now, going forward, we will constantly be evaluating what we do internally in terms of developing our own silicon technology, and what we can get from merchant silicon vendors, and making the right decisions based on the capabilities that we can get externally versus that what we can do internally, and that's exactly what we're doing right now. So, net-net this is a competitive industry; we've never lost sight of that. But I'm comfortable with where we are from a technology standpoint and our ability to compete.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations","Thanks, Jess.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Kesireddy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Rami, I just want to go back to the discussion around pricing pressure. I was just wondering if this pricing pressure is more concentrated on sell-in customers, and whether we could expect a recovery there any time soon. And also, just going back to your 2016 full year revenue outlook, I think on the last conference call, you said you were constructive on revenue growth, and now it looks like \u2013 it sounded to me like you are turning down a little bit. I was just wondering what has changed in the last three months. Exiting Q1, I thought things were getting better and now, clearly there's a change in tone. Any more color you can give there would be really helpful.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me start and I'll see if Ken wants to weigh in on this. With respect to the comments about pricing, there are no clear patterns in terms of specific customers with the exception of just saying that it's mostly focused in the EMEA region and it's mostly a result of things like foreign exchange. We're not calling this a new normal in terms of gross margins. I think there are a number of things that we can do to improve things going forward; but in the meantime, we're going to be very prudent in how we manage the business, control operating expenses, and so on.","And then from a revenue standpoint, actually, what we said is that we remain constructive on the full year from a revenue standpoint, 2016 versus 2015. Where we're being a bit more cautious is on our operating margins and that's primarily as a result of the gross margin impact that we're seeing in Q2 \u2013 that we saw in Q2. But we'll continue to manage the business very prudently to protect operating margins to the extent that we can.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question ma'am.","Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Balaji Krishnamurthy calling on her behalf. I have two questions. The first one on the Routing business, you mentioned that you saw a (24:38) decline in that business in the U.S. cloud providers segment. What drove the weakness there? And then on the Security business, maybe just to back up a little bit. So, since you refreshed SRX last year, you saw some strong growth through the remaining part of 2015, but it's now again fallen off in the first two quarters. So what kind of visibility do you have in terms of recovery for that vertical, and is it through the existing portfolio, or would you be adding more products into the portfolio? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, thanks Balaji for the questions. On the Routing, I think that we actually are encouraged by what we've seen in Routing in terms of the sequential improvement from the Q1 standpoint. And we really saw this across all geos, so that's actually something that we are happy about. I think that if you look at the Routing opportunity \u2013 oh, the last thing \u2013 the second thing I would say about Routing is just from a demand metrics standpoint, our bookings were strong. A lot of the deferred revenue that we saw in Q2 was also connected to Routing. So, that gives us confidence in the second half of the year as it pertains to Routing.","Certainly, there is a cloud, there's a telco, there's a cable component to our Routing business. I feel good about the cloud component. I think that the new products are going to have a big role in the cloud provider networks. And I think that should start in the second half of the year. Telco is a bit more of a mixed message. I think if I look at the global opportunity, there are certainly good opportunities, especially in international for our Routing products. That includes the MX and the new PTX products. I think visibility for Tier 1 telcos in particular for the second half remain somewhat challenging. I think on the Enterprise side, we saw good, very good in fact, sequential recovery in Q2. That was across Switching and Routing, and I feel pretty good about that in the second half as well. So, I think there's actually quite a lot of good things happening from a Routing standpoint if you factor in the opportunities, as the refresh cycle that we're undertaking right now.","Oh, and thank you for reminding me, Ken, there was a secondary question about Security. So, Security sequentially up over Q1, but certainly nowhere near what it would need to be for us to be happy or content with the performance of this business. We're disappointed in the results. I think this is the business that is right now in transition. And I expect it to be in transition for the remainder of this year. As I've always said that, it's \u2013 this transition is going to be somewhat lumpy in terms of how the business is going to perform. Last year, I'd say that the performance was better than my expectations, and it was largely driven by some large telco and cloud deployments that this year haven't really played out yet to offset some of the transitions that we are executing on in the Enterprise side.","And that's where the focus is. I think we have a very compelling and competitive service provider solution for high bandwidth Security applications. That's true also for the cloud. The part of the business that requires more attention and focus, and the one that we're actually giving the attention focus to today is on the Enterprise side. The feedback that we're getting from our partners, our customers, on the roadmap, on the products that we have introduced thus far, is very encouraging, but there is still a ton of execution for us to work through, through the rest of this year, and I expect the growth to happen next year.","Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. All the best. Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, this is Dan Gaide on for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. In the past we've talked about RFP activity increasing, particularly in Switching and Security, and it looks like we're starting to see that pay off for Switching. But can you just talk about what it's going to take to get to that next level in Security and just getting you through that transition period that you just mentioned?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks for the question, Dan. What it's going to take is more execution on our part, and a bit of time, to be honest. The Security space is a very competitive space. The thing that I think Juniper can leverage to our advantage is the fact that we're really thinking about it from a solutions standpoint. So as we go to our customers and help them build out a private cloud data center or a hybrid cloud data center, or things like on-premises cloud CPE solutions, there is a Security element to each and every one of those solutions. So, we are thinking about this from an overall architectural standpoint, how the technologies tie together, and, of course, then positioning Security along with the Routing and Switching. So, I think that's playing out already quite nicely in the cloud side.","From an Enterprise standpoint, Enterprise campus, and so on, there is still some more features to develop, new hardware to release into the market, to get the cost per bit or the price per bit more competitive in the Security space. And I think next year is the year where we'll have enough critical mass to start seeing a recovery in the business.","Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. Just a quick follow-up on the Security \u2013 sorry, sort of three in a row \u2013 but how much this year do you think is being complicated, or trying to get the Security business right-footed and prepared to return to growth, is being complicated by some of the publicity around vulnerabilities in previous Juniper generations, et cetera? Is that having much of an impact? And I guess my second part of the question is in terms of future business development. How should we think about changes or how you address the changes in relationships with Nokia and Ericsson? Is that part of the competitive pressure that you're feeling in EMEA? Thanks a lot.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, thanks for the question, James. On the Security side, the vulnerability that you discussed is at this point largely behind us. We took the matter very seriously. We did a very thorough internal review to make sure that the vulnerability was very specific to our old legacy screen OS Security products, and made sure that there is no such effect on the \u2013 and we in fact, invited a third-party company to come in to help us with this assessment, that there is no vulnerability on the Juno side. We were open with our customers, and I think we got a lot of kudos from our customers in how we handled the situation. I'm not saying that it has had no effect, but I think that the team did a good job of minimizing any effect.","Right now, I think the main issue with Security is, there is a critical mass of new products, new features, new technologies we need to get into the market to be able to go after the largest market opportunities that exist. Right now, we're competitive, but in specific areas and use cases, and we need to be competitive in a broader set of use cases in Security. That's what we're absolutely maniacally focused on. In Security, the thing you should notice, as I mentioned, there is a strong revenue synergy associated with Switching and Routing, but there's also an equally strong cost synergy because much of the innovation that we put into Switching and Routing also contributes to our Security product portfolio.","On your question related to our partners, Nokia and Ericsson, there's no real new news there. I think, with both of these customers \u2013 or these partners \u2013 we have talked about how the volume of business it's still relatively a small percentage of our overall revenue as a company. It has been on the decline well before some of the acquisitions and partnerships that have been announced and that's primarily because Juniper has been taking its destiny into its own hands. So in Europe, for example, the theater that you mentioned, we have over the years been taking more and more of the Tier 1 telecom operators to a direct engagement model, and that has played out well for us in terms of the business and the strategic nature of the relationships with those customers.","Net-net, I think between the deliberate strategy that we're taking to go direct with certain customers that we need to go direct, especially those that have volume of business that's large enough, as well as the partnerships that we have available today, whether it be with NEC or with Ericsson or with IBM or with Amdocs, I'm not concerned at all about our ability to reach our customers in EMEA or elsewhere in the world.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Netis from William Blair. Please proceed.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you for taking my question. I want to go back to the sort of the top line. And I know several questions have been asked, but I want to sort of get a sense of how you guys are thinking in the back half of the year. And could Security, given clearly, being a headwind here, could that potentially be down 25% \u2013 20%, 25% \u2013 this year? And if that is the case, and you are planning for top line to be up slightly \u2013 so, let's assume it's up maybe 1% \u2013 that gives you a bit of a tough ramp in the Q4 timeframe of modeling somewhere in the 5.5%, 6%, maybe 6.5% range. So, what are sort of the ebbs and flows \u2013 given that Security is down \u2013 do you expect the Switching to kind of contribute, the Routing to contribute? And is Security really going to be down that much in that 20%, 25% range decline?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, yeah.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Can you give us a little bit of how to think about Q4?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I got the question and I appreciate it. I think, look to the example of Q2. Security, year-over-year, was down pretty significantly, but despite that we came in at the high end of our range for revenue. I think when we provide the constructive view of 2016 all-up, we're certainly factoring in what we expect from Switching, Routing and Security. Security is going to be a headwind. Keep in mind that the new products that are in the market now at standard lead times, where we're competing for opportunities worldwide, are mostly in the area of Routing and in Switching. And I think this is where we have the confidence that that part of the business is going to perform sufficiently to offset weakness and headwinds in Security. Anything else, Ken?","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, just to talk a little bit about the numbers. So to your point, the first half results was about 1% up year-on-year, half-on-half. Q3 at the midpoint of guidance is flat year-on-year at the midpoint. We're not giving Q4 guidance, but I do think we're constructive on our Q4 ability to grow sequentially, primarily because of the strength in new products and some of the other factors that Rami's mentioned. That gets us to our modest growth for the year.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, and then my follow-up, if I look at the sort of geo splits, it sounds \u2013 most of the upside, I mean, you've seen it across all regions, that's fair \u2013 but most of the upside seems to have come from the APAC side of the equation. So, can you just fill in and talk about that and what's driving that? Is the partnerships with NEC or Lenovo or anybody else out there that you're seeing the uptick in revenue from?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's actually a great question. I am extremely proud of how our team in Asia-Pacific is executing right now. Around a year, year and a half ago or so, we made some changes in that region from a leadership standpoint. From a structural standpoint, we've refocused on parts of the APAC market that we believe are first growing, second, we are best equipped to support. We have activated partnerships that are helping us in Japan. We are in the process of activating a partnership with Lenovo, as we have announced historically, that will help us in worldwide but especially in APAC and especially in China. And looking out, I think the opportunity there for further momentum and growth are there. It's still a fairly challenging market for a variety of reasons, but with solid execution, we've now have had several quarters of performance, and again, very proud of the team.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then maybe a quick one to Ken on the BTI. What was the revenue in the quarter from BTI? Just a housekeeping question there.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so we're not going to break it out specifically, but we did guide to $10 million to $15 million for the quarter, and it came in in line with our expectations.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck, guys.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, this is Justin on for Jim Suva. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on the progression of the ERP system and when the impact you believe is going to start to produce a productivity improvement and efficiencies moving forward.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll take that question. So, it's a good question. So, the way I describe it, clearly Q1 was the period of ramp; Q2 was largely the period of stability. We've made a lot of progress in Q2 on our processes and streamlining those processes. We still have a little \u2013 a few areas to still improvement upon \u2013 but for the most part the ERP stability is there.","I would say, you didn't ask about DSO but some of those stability factors in invoicing did cause a few days of DSO to be higher than expected so DSO came in at 55. If you were to normalize for ERP activity, I think we'd be closer to the 50 range. But from a going forward, you're absolutely right, the focus for the second half and for next year is on value creation and optimization, leveraging the new system we have in place, and really streamlining our operation. So that is absolutely yet to come and something we're very focused on.","Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, I'm calling on behalf of Steve. I was hoping to get an update on the campus Switching business. Was it down year-over-year and do you foresee the new EX series helping the business return to growth? And I was also curious if you're seeing increased competitive pressures from most of your competitors having a wireless LAN business. Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me take that. Just net-net, I'd say the business was probably more flattish if you look at campus Switching specifically. But let me just qualify this a bit. We have been executing at Juniper on a very deliberate strategy of focusing on where the growth is, and where we can differentiate the most in the Switching area. And that is in Enterprise IT data centers, in private cloud, in public cloud. And that's why we've seen our Switching business perform really well.","We do go after campus opportunities, but we mostly limit ourselves and our focus on the largest campuses that are typically very mission-critical and on-ramps to the cloud. And we also, of course, focus on customers that are able and willing to pick best-of-breed decisions between wired and wireless, right, so we can work effectively with our wireless partners in going after that opportunity. So, I think that if you consider all that, a flattish Switching performance for campus is something that I'm actually okay with. Overall, I think the Switching business is growing, and that's a result of the deliberate strategy and the focus that we've had as a company and I think that's a very good thing.","Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC","And as a follow-up, can I get an update on the Lenovo partnership?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Certainly, yeah. So this is \u2013 it's still right now in the early stages in terms of putting in place the mechanics of how we're going to go after our customers worldwide, the partners and the channels that we need to work through and agree on, and also the technology integration that we are going to execute on to make sure that we provide compelling solutions to our customers. So, I think we've said historically that we don't anticipate meaningful contribution this year, and that remains the case. I think where this is going to start to benefit both Juniper and Lenovo is next year. I remain optimistic and excited about the opportunity in working with Lenovo. As you know, there's a large part of the market that is interested in converged stack architectures and having really compelling servers, storage, and networking working tightly together is something that I think is going to be helpful to our business.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to kind of walk through three time periods to understand gross margin issues. So first of all, in the near term, you talked about challenges in the EMEA region, but it doesn't look to me that we've seen all that much movement during the June quarter of the Euro-to-dollar exchange rate, pre- the Brexit vote. So I'm just wondering whether this was an issue where it had been building up for some time and a competitor who sells in euros, basically you concluded you had to respond that things wouldn't move back in your favor.","And then when we look out to 2017, I think most of us expect you'll face a new competitor in Routing, particularly in the data center. And we're wondering how that competitive dynamic could play out with a new entrant that sounds like they will be somewhat aggressive on pricing.","And then looking out even further, the last part of this gross margin trend, is when does the software business, the Contrail and NorthStar products, when do they become material enough to be a tailwind to gross margin? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, great set of questions. Let me start, and maybe I'll start with more of the 2017 competitive question that you have. First, I would say that this is not \u2013 that competitive issue around new entrants into the market introducing the sort of Routing capabilities and so forth \u2013 that's not the issue that we're seeing in the Q3 and the Q2 timeframe. Are we anticipating that this industry is going to be \u2013 continue to be competitive? Absolutely, which is why it is so important for us to continue to focus on cost of goods sold improvements in our products to innovate in the area of ensuring that we can compete very effectively in those three different use cases that I mentioned just previously, around rich Routing, lean Routing and Switching, and also to preserve our long-term targets for gross margins. And based on everything that I know, the innovations and the technology that we're developing in the company, the plans that we have going forward, I feel comfortable that that can be done.","I think from a software standpoint, we had provided guidance that by the 2019 timeframe, we will see that around 45% of our overall revenue is going to come from software and services. A lot of that is going to be in the area of recurring revenue in software, and I think that certainly helps us from a gross margin standpoint. I'll let Ken talk some more to that.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'll touch on the first and the third one. From a U.S. dollar strengthening, you're absolutely right, this really isn't related to a Q2 specific change in foreign currencies. It's more of the buildup over the last few quarters over the strengthening dollar, and the fact it's starting to have an impact on our customer budgets and their ability to purchase our equipment. So it's really more of the long-term buildup of the FX concerns, or strengthening of the U.S. dollar, I should say.","From a software \u2013 Rami's right \u2013 the 45% was our long-term model of services and software. Just to level set those, we're at about 3% of our business was software last year, and I would expect it to grow gradually between that, and call it 15% to 20% if you presume services remains relatively stable, software stand alone would be 3% today, to 15% to 20% by 2019 and it should progress pretty gradually between now and then. We are seeing some benefit today. We talk about product mix. There are headwinds; there are tailwinds. Albeit, it's a relatively small percentage of our revenue, it's a growing percentage and every incremental dollar in software does help us on the gross margin line.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, that's really very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So, in terms of the gross margin getting back to that 64% metric, I would think that the opticals business that you guys purchased with BTI would see sequential growth throughout the year. And then in addition, if we assume there's no change in the FX dynamic, are you going to be able to get to 64% margin if you're doing $1.3 billion in revenue?","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so our current visibility from Q3 is reflected in the guidance we gave, which is 63%. So again, in line with Q2, primarily because some of the factors that developed in Q2, we see in Q3 as well.","For the longer term, we're not giving Q4 guidance, but I think it's safe to expect some sequential improvement in both gross margin and operating margin in Q4. That's really our historic pattern and I would expect to drive to that in Q4 as well. We're clearly not giving up on the 64% operating model. We're working on cost innovation, cost improvements, cost structure, as well as product innovation, I should say, and making sure we sell the value of that.","From a BTI perspective, I do expect BTI to ramp, and it does have a slight impact to gross margin percentage. However, I would state that the first quarter of ramp we did have some startup costs, et cetera, that as BTI scales, it will become more margin favorable than it is today as we go forward.","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me \u2013 an additional thing I'd like to add on the optical side as a reminder \u2013 is that we're not after building a stand-alone optical business. I think the world has enough optical technology providers. What we're out to do is to really capture an inflection point in the market around packet optical solutions that include the packet layers, the optical layers, and also very importantly, the software layers that tie all of these together.","So, we're playing much more of a disruptive game in the optical space as it pertains to packet integration. You might have seen the news around Juniper joining the Telecom Infra Project with Facebook and Microsoft and others. The whole idea is to develop open, interoperable solutions in the networking domain around packet optical that I think will benefit us in the long term.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, a quick housekeeping question, and then a real question. Can you remind me what percentage of total revenue was cloud providers?","And I hate to ask about gross margins yet again \u2013 I recognize this is the fourth time on this call \u2013 but going through the math, I'm still confused with the simple question being how much of this is secular versus how much is transitory. EMEA was down as a percentage of total revenue in both 1Q and 2Q versus last year, and that was about 1.5 to 4 percentage points. I recognize some of that is the lower pricing impacting revenues. But your product gross margin was down almost one percentage point sequentially following 100 basis point to over 200 basis point decline in the first quarter from calendar 2015 levels, and the quarter represents an all-time low. And I'm not trying to give you a hard time, I'm just trying to understand, how much of this is secular? How much of it is transitory? The FX was an issue throughout last year as well, for that matter.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so we really did not experience much in the way of FX-related pricing pressure last year. We started to experience a little bit of it in Q4 of last year, but quite honestly the elevated pricing pressure that we experienced in Q2 was new to us, right? It hit us stronger than it has in the past. It's always been a very competitive environment, and we've been able to deal with that, and we expect to be able to deal with that going forward, but the Q2 pricing pressure, particularly in EMEA, was acute this quarter and that is new.","The other impact, we talked about pricing pressure as well as margin. We're not breaking out exact math, but they had both roughly an equal impact to the call it traditional 64%, or our long-term model of 64% versus the 63% result. Product mix really has the ability to go either way. In this particular quarter, it cost us a couple tenths and hurt us, but we do have chassis sales out there, we can fill with line cards (51:25). We're transforming the company to more of a software stream (51:43), so we're very focused on recouping the margins that we lost in Q2, and are not coming off our long-term model.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","On the pricing pressure, and if you said I apologize, but was that across the board in EMEA? Was it certain product markets more prevalent, certain customer markets? Can you give us any insight? And again, if you can share with us the percentage of revenue from cloud providers.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so the cloud providers, I'll touch on that because I forgot last time. Sorry about that. In FY 2015 we talked about it being \u2013 2016 \u2013 being 19% of the total revenue and obviously our fastest growing vertical, it gets us to nearer 25% by 2019. So that's a reminder of the cloud vertical.","From a pricing and where it happened, it was really more geographic and customer-specific, I would say, than just a broad base. We did see pressure globally. I think the macro environment as it relates to this geopolitical issues, et cetera, are kind of being different in every geo, but we are seeing a bit of global pressure but really specific to EMEA and specific to certain geographies in EMEA.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Is it Enterprise, Service Provider, both?","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's both. I would not say it's a customer vertical specific situation.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland from Baird. Please proceed.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great, thank you. Rami, I wanted to follow up on your prepared remarks around CEB, the cloud-enabled brand solution, and maybe to start your broader perspective on SD-WAN, the pace of adoption as you see it in the market, and you outlined some opportunities. Is this also a revenue headwind for the category as corporates shift away from expensive MPOS interconnects?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, thanks for the question, Jason. I think actually, the cloud-enabled branch solutions that we're developing are in fact a potential tailwind for us. So, as I have mentioned with respect to the telco space, and them moving, changing their architectures and moving to much more of an agile scale-out service delivery model, we want to make sure that we are in the middle of this architectural transformation that's happening. So that once they start to prove out the model and to make revenue \u2013 and to start growing their virtualized solution business, that we benefit from that. And I would say that although the revenue contribution to Juniper is still very small, the opportunity is very large in the future. And I think we are in many cases in pole position in working and developing these solutions for our customers.","I know SD-WAN is sort of a very big topic these days. I think our best and most immediate opportunity is to support and help our service provider and telco customers, in developing very effective, agile, cost-competitive solutions that will help them in competing effectively with the stand-alone point player SD-WAN players that are out there. That's what we're doing, and I think that's our best strategy considering the relationships we have with our telcos and also the technology that we've developed for them.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And Rami, pace of adoption, SDN's been somewhat slow. Is this going to happen more quickly?","Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director","SDN is such a broad term. If you look at SDN as it pertains to the cloud virtualization, cloud orchestration, there I'm pleased with the pace of adoption, the win rate, even if revenue is still relatively small compared to our overall revenue of the company for Contrail. What I like about it is it's a very strategic part of every sale, every engagement. It's almost entirely subscription-based recurring revenue and it's setting ourselves up for selling virtualized Security, virtualized Routing, et cetera, in the future. I think that part is moving according to plan.","As far as these new cloud-enabled brand solutions, a lot of it was going to depend on the success of the telcos in making those services successful to their end customers, in particular the enterprise customers. So, we're helping them do that because we recognize that if we help them do that, and they grow that business, we will be able to grow a brand new revenue stream for the company, and that's something that I'm very excited about. I don't think it's going to happen meaningfully this year, but I'm hopeful that it'll start to contribute in a meaningful way next year.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations","Thank you. And we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay, our final question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Please proceed.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Just a quick question on the pricing. Can you comment about pricing in the Security sector in particular? You had a competitor this morning also note some pricing pressure in that sector.","Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so we saw pricing pressure really in all technologies. However, Security \u2013 definitely not immune from that \u2013 so we did see some pricing pressure in Security. But again, our strongest correlation was more geographic really than it was product related.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen...","Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations","Okay, well, that ends...","Operator","I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kathleen.","Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations","No, no, no go ahead, Chris. I was going to say the same thing. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have today.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth. Thank you. You may begin.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial condition and operating results, capital return program and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release furnished with our 8-K today and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time-to-time.

Full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today.","Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks Kathleen, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter with total revenue at $1.285 billion, stronger than the outlook we provided, and up sequentially across all technologies and geographies. We again delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, including strong operating income, operating margin and earnings per share. I'm pleased with our overall performance, particularly with our focus on execution, and we continue to take steps necessary to position the company for continued growth.","I've said before that I believe we have a great strategy in place to be a pure-play innovator in IP networking that is going to transform the economics of networking with leading scale, performance and automation. As the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the market is shifting in our favor and will actually help us accelerate our strategy to power this cloud transformation. The investments we've made over the last few years have culminated in the strongest and most highly differentiated product portfolio in the history of this company.","We now have a set of new products across key technology areas that we expect will help us achieve our revenue potential for the second half of this year and beyond. If you look at the products we've recently introduced in the market, they were developed with a keen understanding of what cloud providers want and need. In many cases, they were developed in partnership with our customers. One of the most important things that we must do as a company is to ensure that we help our customers succeed as they transition to the cloud.","Now I'd like to summarize some highlights this quarter across Routing, Switching and Security. We are pleased to see our Routing business continue to grow sequentially and year-over-year. While we are particularly pleased with growth in the cloud vertical, we saw our diversification strategy play out across telco and cable verticals in our product mix and across geographies. Our PTX line had another record revenue quarter and along with our MX platform, they are proving be our customers' preferred choices for their core and Edge as they move faster to deployment with increasing confidence and appreciation of our technology differentiation.","I'm very pleased with our strong performance in Switching, where we saw continued growth in the data center and with cloud and content providers. We've seen a lot of interest for our new QFX products from cloud providers as well as from large telcos, cable providers, large enterprises and federal governments who are demanding high capacity, high speed networking. For the Q3 period, total revenue for our QFX switch line grew at 50% year-over-year. Our deliberate focus on the cloud opportunity has resulted in a fast-growing data center switching portfolio over the past three years, and I believe we now have a complete portfolio that is going to help us continue to grow our Switching business in the future.","Security continues to be a business that is in transition for us. We've made progress in certain areas, introducing new management software and enhancing the overall efficacy of our flagship SRX platform, which in fact has recently received third-party validation for excellent security efficacy in next-gen firewall testing.","Earlier this month, at our Annual Customer Event NXTWORK 2016, we announced critical enhancements to our Security portfolio, extending our software-defined secured network vision with advanced automated enforcement throughout the network. These additions include Junos Space Security Director's Policy Enforcer, which delivered deeper network threat prevention down to the switch level. We also announced new mid-range firewalls, the SRX4100 and the SRX4200 that are optimized for hybrid clouds environment.","Looking ahead, our priority remains on innovation, execution and on improving our performance and operating efficiencies. At Investor Day earlier this year we stated we are constructive on 2016 growth for the full year. We remain constructive in the second half of 2016 and are pleased with the traction our new products are seeing with customers. The market trends taking place in the industry play to our core competencies and provide growth opportunities for a challenger like Juniper. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on them.","I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Finally, I want to extend a very big thank you to our employees, who each play a role in helping shape a stronger Juniper.","With that said, I'll turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss results of the quarter in more detail.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results of the September quarter reflect solid sequential revenue and earnings growth. Our sequential revenue growth was balanced across all technologies, markets and geographies. And we are pleased with the momentum of our new products. We saw continued data center strength, particularly with our QFX family of products, which grew 50% year-over-year.","In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were cloud or cable providers, four were telecoms and two were enterprises. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-build greater than one and an increase in product deferred revenue up 24% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $245 million, down $109 million sequentially primarily due to payments for incentive compensation. During the quarter, we repurchased $112 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends.","As many of you know, we initiated a capital return program in early 2014. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $4.60 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion. And we reiterate our commitment to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow inclusive of share repurchases and dividends beginning in 2017.","Non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. Year-over-year, the decrease in product gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was due to product mix and elevated pricing pressure, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline.","Now moving onto Q4 outlook, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We are focused on executing to our strategy and capitalizing on the momentum of our new products and expect continued strength with cloud providers and enterprise customers. While we continue to see pricing pressure and product mix fluctuations, we remain focused on cost improvements. We expect gross margins to remain approximately at their Q3 levels in the near-term. On a full year basis at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect revenue growth, which is consistent with our outlook from previous quarters, as well as earnings per share growth.","We are focused on growth and continued earnings expansion and are confident in our strategy and long-term model. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.","And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter. I want to squeeze two in. First, for Rami, it sounds like you saw really good traction for the QFX lineup. I was hoping you could help us understand which of these models have been driving the strength, if there were any large deals here, or if it was more broad-based? And perhaps to what degree do you see this lineup competing for routing opportunities versus Jericho-based alternatives, and what are the implications of success in that application on your core routing business? How should we think about that?","And then for Ken, I was hoping you could provide some additional color on the pricing environment. Last quarter, you suggested we'd likely to see some gross margin improvement. As volumes picked up in Q4, we could potentially get back to the 64% levels over time. Now it sounds like you don't expect to see any improvement in Q4. So perhaps you can touch upon what's changed. Is pricing pressure still concentrated in Europe? Is it more broad-based? To what extent we should be thinking about 63% as the new normal, or do you still think we can see some improvement next year? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay. Jess, thanks for the question. Let me start with the switching question, and then I'll pass it over to Ken to talk about gross margins. So first, very pleased with the performance of our switching business in the Q3 timeframe. In particular, what you're seeing is that the focus that we have on the data center and the cloud opportunity is really starting to pay off for us. And you can see that in the strength of the QFX portfolio all up.","As you know, the new products that we've introduced, the QFX10002, the QFX10008 and the upcoming QFX10016 are all intended to round out an end-to-end switching portfolio that make us competitive in far more switching opportunities than we've ever been historically. And that's exactly what we're seeing. So what we're \u2013 we're now participating in proof of concepts, in RFPs, et cetera, that we quite frankly just never had access to historically. So the new products that we've introduced are they themselves starting to ramp as we expected in the second half. But more importantly, they round out a portfolio in a way that gives us more competitiveness overall. And now add to that our Contrail Orchestration System, routing at the edge of the data center and security, and we really have a very compelling end-to-end cloud data center portfolio that we're I think leveraging very effectively.","On your question around Jericho and silicon, obviously a question that we get quite a lot. Every new product we develop, we do it with a keen eye on making sure that we choose the very best silicon for that product. We're not religious about what silicon that we choose, but I will say this. Every decision we've made thus far in all products across routing and switching that we have developed has been absolutely the right one. And that means in certain cases, we're going to use custom, in certain cases, we're going to use merchant, and that might change over time as we look out and we develop sort of the roadmaps across switching and routing in the future. But for now, rest assured, I feel very good about the decisions that we've made thus far in our silicon choices. I think you had one more thing which is around routing. The data center problem is in fact a high performance networking problem that requires a robust routing stack. And that is one of the key differentiators of our QFX product line. Ken?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Great. So on the gross margin question, Jess, yeah, the Q2 results were in line with our expectations for the quarter. From a pricing perspective, we did talk about elevated pricing pressure that we experienced in Q2. For Q3, we saw that normalize a bit, so we didn't see the continuation of the elevated pressure. We saw a little more normalization across quarter-on-quarter. Still a very competitive market though. I would definitely keep that in mind. A lot of factors go into our guidance for gross margin. Clearly, the macro environment, the competitive landscape, customer mix, product mix, and there's a fair amount of uncertainty in some of those dimensions. So I think the prudent thing at this point, which is what we set into our guidance, is to assume 63% not only for Q4 but in the near term as we continue to work through the macro uncertainties and some of the other fluctuations in our gross margin. We're very focused on continuing to deliver innovation and continuing to improve our cost structure, and we are driving towards our 64% long-term gross margin. But again, I think the prudent thing to do for the time being Q4 and the near term would be to assume 64%. I'm sorry, 63%.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks guys.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Next.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay, and thank you. Before we continue with the Q&A, let's try to keep it to one question you guys, as much as you can. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, everybody. Thank you for take the question. I had like a very long list of questions. Now, I'll have to pick one. I'm sorry for that. Maybe I'll pick a fairly specific one, that's on your QFX product line. So my assumption is that (16:03) is a lot of your success with your cloud clients at the moment. And my other assumption is that what you've been able to bring to the market in terms telemetry and the quality of your telemetry features have weighted a lot in your commercial success. And if I'm not mistaken, Arista, who is probably one of your main competitors in that segment, brought up new product line with improved telemetry offerings. And so my question would be do you think the competitive landscape could evolve a bit in the coming two or three quarters with a competitor getting closer to you, at least on that dimension? And could that inflect a bit your commercial success there?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Pierre, for the question. First, I think that the success that we've seen in the QFX all up is more broad based than just the large cloud providers. I think there are \u2013 it includes success in certain cloud providers, in the enterprise, in federal government and also in fact, in some teleco opportunities as well. When I think about the competitiveness of our product portfolio in Switching, there are very different aspects of it. First is scale. And typically when people hear the word scale they think of the number of ports on a box. But it's actually more complicated than that. It's also around the number of routes, number of hosts, number of IP addresses, what we call logical scale. And we've really pushed the envelope on the logical scale of our product that give us an edge compared to anything that's out there today.","Then there's the robust routing capabilities. We have full Junos IP stack on this thing, which makes it very suitable for high performance, high scale data center opportunities. Telemetry, you're absolutely right. The team has done a fantastic job of innovating in terms of new modern telemetry capabilities. Do I expect that the competitive landscape will evolve? Absolutely. We innovate all the time with the assumption that our competitors are aggressive and they're moving fast, and that's why we just have to move faster. And I think we're doing that. I think the most important thing you need to understand as you look at the switching and the cloud opportunity, is that we're playing an offensive game. We are out to take share in switching, in data center with a new end-to-end portfolio that is very competitive.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks for that.","Operator","Our next question comings from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.","Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Balaji on behalf of Simona. I was wondering if you could touch on the geographical trends, especially with Europe? You had a few quarters of declines there on a one-on-one basis. Where do you see a turn in that market? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question. Let me start, and maybe Ken has some more color to add. First, I think we saw good momentum up year-over-year, 5% in the Americas. We also saw sequential growth in the Americas as well. That was driven largely by cloud providers, by cable operators and also by large enterprises. So we're very pleased with the performance there.","EMEA sequentially was actually quite healthy, and it's driven \u2013 our business in EMEA is driven mostly by large telcos. Now, there's certainly some factors in EMEA that we're keeping a very close eye on. Economic stability, Brexit, foreign exchange and so on, that give us some room or some cause to be a little bit concerned about it going forward. But so far, I would say just judging by the performance we've seen in Q3, things are looking pretty good.","Last but not least, APAC continues to be a good growth engine for us. I think the team there is executing really well with 18% year-over-year growth driven by a number of different verticals, cloud in particular. And we're even seeing good sequential growth in China with the partnerships that we've announced there and with our product portfolio that's actually working quite well for us over there.","Anything you want to add, Ken?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","No, I mean, I'd just reiterate. EMEA was the one geography that was down year-on-year, as you noted. I think it is a challenging marketplace there. There's a lot going on. We're clearly staying as close to the market situation as we can. And I would say because of the macro uncertainties, it has a propensity to be a little more choppy than normal, right? We are pretty concentrated on telco, as Rami mentioned, so as the telcos go, as some of the big deployments happen, you might see revenue fluctuate a little more in that geography going forward as some of the others.","Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. I want to compare the opportunity in telcos versus cloud, and take a more maybe of a long-term view. So if the pending in telcos, if it continues to decline, is your participation in the cloud opportunity big enough or large enough to offset this? And maybe you can talk about your participation among cloud providers, what kind of products and projects \u2013 conceptually, what kind of projects and products you're working on? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure. Thanks for the question. I think that the cloud opportunity remains robust for the foreseeable future. I mean, at the end of this year and I think into next year, large cloud providers and as well as the second tier cloud providers that are what we call Born in the Cloud, their business models evolved around the cloud opportunity, are essentially recognizing that their wide area networks and their data center networks are essential to delivering the kinds of experience that their customers demand. And for that reason, I think spending there will be robust. Telco is a little bit of a different story, and I've been consistent in how I've talked about the telco opportunity over the last few quarters. First, I think just judging by the conversations we have with our telco customers as well as their CapEx reports for the year and how much they've spent thus far, we do expect there to be some spending by telcos in the Q4 period.","Longer-term in telcos, all service providers \u2013 or many service providers are going through an architectural transformation. They're really thinking about how to leverage their networks as essentially a distributed cloud network. And we are very pleased with how we're working very closely with our telco customers, who we obviously enjoy a very close working relationship with, to help them with that transformation. And that speaks to our broad portfolio of switching, routing, security and very much around our cloud software, Contrail being a very powerful tool that we have today to engage very strategically with these architectural transformations that are happening at our telco customers.","Summing that all up, I think that for \u2013 because of this transformation that's happening, telcos we can expect will divert their focus to that transition and less on just building out their core or their Edge networks in the way that they have done in the past. The most important thing is that we remain very engaged, very close with them in the transformation so that we can benefit from the new types of buildouts that they will be deploying. And I think that will start in the 2017 timeframe. So they're going through this shift, and we just have to make sure that we stay very close and we capitalize on the solutions we're offering them to help them with the shift itself.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. A genuine clarification first, and then the question. You were kind enough to give us some detail on the Top 10 customers showing some good balance. I wasn't quite sure where the cloud providers, the Googles, Amazons, Facebooks, whether you consider those service providers or enterprises in your discussion of customers. So just a clarification on that. And then in terms of the trend, you've talked about the web scale cloud providers being a high teens percent of revenue in the last couple of quarters. Just wondering where you stand today with that group? And how you see that group as a percent of sales longer term as you look out into 2017? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So the clarification, so those customers you mentioned would be part of our cloud vertical, which roll up into the service provider market if you will. So just to clarify that. That's where they stand.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","From a vertical perspective, we talked a bit about \u2013 Rami just talked about the cloud vertical and its robustness going forward. And just to remind folks what we talked about at Investor Day. We expect that to be double-digit growth over the next three-year period, 10% to 13% CAGR. Right now, last year FY 2015, the cloud vertical represented about 19% of our total revenue. Clearly it's going be our fastest growing vertical over the next few years. So it will continue to take more percentage of our total revenue. And we expect it to get to approximately 24% by 2019. So it will be a bigger piece of our revenue going forward.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dmitry Netis of William Blair.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you very much for taking my question. I actually had kind of a follow-up to a previous question. And that is if I look at the commentary, you guys had mentioned QFX had done real well. Data center cloud had done real well. But if I look at the relative stress and width quarter-over-quarter where the revenue came from, it came mostly from the routing side. And I think from the commentary where the cloud guys sit, they sit in the service provider I think what you said. That vertical was actually down by about $35 million versus Enterprise that was up $58 million quarter-over-quarter. So I'm just trying to reconcile the strength there, whether that's really the PTX or is something else? Can you help us reconcile the difference?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not sure I'm following your math precisely, so I apologize for that. We could follow-up. But I would say that from a year-on-year perspective, Switching led by QFX was our strongest growing technology. Switching was up 10%. Routing was up 3%. In absolute dollars, Routing continues to be our largest technology. So in absolute dollars, they're more similar in growth year-on-year. The sequential growth was predominantly routing in absolute dollars but again, pretty broad based and consistent across technologies. Routing was up 8%. Switching was up 6%, and Security was up 9%. So I'm not sure I answered your question, but I'd be glad to follow up with you with more details.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you. I was referring on the sequential basis, strictly where the relative strength came from. And it seems it had come from routing. That's \u2013 and then the enterprise was also pretty strong relatively speaking from quarter-over-quarter. So that's why I was just trying to reconcile those two.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. No, so, you're right. Routing was up 8% quarter-on-quarter. Switching was up 6%. We did have a pretty strong switching quarter in Q2. And we have seen strength in Enterprise on a sequential basis since the Q1 lows, right? So we had a pretty strong Q2 sequentially and Q3 sequentially. However, Enterprise is still down slightly year-on-year. So the macro and some of the transition impacts that really affected us in Q1 are starting to subside, and we're starting to return to growth on the Enterprise segment.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Can I just follow-up on one thing, the PTX side of things. Can you give us a little \u2013 can you qualify what the revenue percent of total? Or percent of routing? Or what the growth in that segment was as you did for QFX, just so that we can calibrate around it?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not going to break it out, but I will give you a qualitative view. The PTX did very well. It had a record quarter. When we developed and released the PTX into the market, we had a thesis around how telcos and cloud providers are going be thinking about the evolution of their wide area networks, the data center interconnect networks. And while it has taken us some time to convince our customers and to help them in making the architectural transition towards those lean core networks or the super-core networks that we called them, what we're seeing right now is exactly what we had expected and hoped for, which is a real acceptance, and in fact, enthusiasm for these sorts of super core, lean-core architecture that are driving the PTX business. So very pleased with the PTX growth thus far. We have a highly differentiated core product in the PTX after the introduction of the new line cards for that platform in the first half of this year. And I am bullish about the growth of the PTX going forward as well.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays.","Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is Dan Gaide on for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. We know that Juniper's having success with next-gen solutions like Contrail and with virtual routing and CPE deployments at both AT&T and Verizon, and that the goal you guys announced is for 45% of revenue to come from software and services in 2019. Are you still tracking with these plans? And how have deployments changed versus when you \u2013 what you may have expected when you originally announced those plans?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes. So you're absolutely right in that Contrail continues to see more and more interest, more and more adoption, especially with the open stack, but not exclusively the open stack community. And more and more, for example, customers are jumping on to the Kubernetes container-type of solutions, for which Contrail is also highly suited. When we think about our software strategy, there are several different elements to it. There is the controller element, the software-defined-networking element, to which Contrail certainly belongs, but also other products like our NorthStar Wide Area SDN controller. There is the virtual network function and the solutions around them. So the success that we've seen with the Cloud CPE Solution at AT&T, Verizon as well as other Tier 1 telcos is indicative of the kinds of investments that we're making today that we believe are going to pay off in the future, I think starting next year.","And then last but not least, the third leg of the stool is around our disaggregation strategy. Over time, we do believe that the way in which we sell the value of our switching, our security, and routing to an extent is going to be more commensurate with how we invest in these products, where the bulk of our investment is in fact in the software. And for that reason, over time, I think this is going be gradual. It's not going to happen overnight, which is why we've given ourselves a few years get to our target. What you're e going to see, I think, our customers are going to buy the value in terms of software SKUs that are essentially decoupled from the hardware. It's still early days. There is an entire industry that needs to sort of transform around that change in business model. But we're working towards that goal. We're working very aggressively towards it.","Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much for taking my question. Rami, kind of a follow-up question to that is as carriers undertake this network transformation you're talking, how are you navigating change in partnerships, et cetera, to provide those carrier customers with the technology knowhow and ability to \u2013 or helping them with their transition from a services perspective? And I guess tied into that, just an OpEx question. You've been running OpEx a little bit lower than your target, at least as a percent of revenue. Do you see room for further cuts in OpEx going forward? Thank you very much.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Let me touch on the partnership question. I'm sure Ken would want to weigh in on the OpEx piece. So we see this in a number of different ways. Partners are extremely important for us in going after broader teleco opportunities. And yes, when it comes to some of these new cloud architectures that telcos are adopting, there are elements of the solution that we count on partners for, in particular, for example, around the OSS\/BSS, the integration into their existing OSS\/BSS systems and so forth. And here we've got fantastic partnerships with companies like NEC, IBM and Amdocs that essentially enables us to provide those end-to-end solutions.","Having said that, however, in every one of these large teleco transformations, we have a very direct interface to the customer, and in some cases we find that the way in which we need to grow our business, our relevance, is by taking the customer from an indirect relationship, fulfillment relationship to a direct one. And we've done that gradually around the world on an as-needed basis. The bottom line is I feel very good about our ability today to take the innovation that we produce in-house and to combine it with that of partners and to reach our customers around the globe through the go-to market capabilities of our partners.","On OpEx, I'll let Ken.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure. Sure. So I'm particularly proud of our OpEx results this quarter, $494 million. We came in below the low point of our guidance range. And that is with an Aurrion, which was an acquisition we closed during the quarter that wasn't factored into our guidance. So we did a great job controlling our costs this quarter. And you can count on us to continuing to do that going forward, particularly in light of some of the macro challenges we're experiencing in the gross margin line as an example. We're doing everything we can to make sure we maximize shareholder returns and shareholder value and really managing OpEx tightly, making sure we grow and expand our earnings as we move forward in these marketing conditions. So it's something you can count on us continuing to do as we move forward.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi.","Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi. This is Justin on for Jim. Thank you for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could comment on any update wins you had for Contrail? And also, if you could just maybe comment in terms of the demand and what the pipeline looks like? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with the Contrail question. I think it's fair to say that the adoption rate of Contrail is tracking really well. We have at least a half a dozen new logos that we scored just in this last quarter. And these are meaningful, large either cloud providers or service providers, telcos. We're seeing especially good strength with the telcos as they undertake this cloud transformation within their own networks. And I expect there to be more success going forward.","A really important element of the Contrail success that we're seeing is in each and every one of the \u2013 I'd say most of the deployments that we've had thus far, it has led to pull-through opportunities, where we can now bundle a portfolio of switching, routing, security into the Contrail solution that we're offering to our customers.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I would add, Rami, is it also typically comes with some professional services engagement as well, which is very \u2013 becoming more and more strategic to our overall solution sale. And last but not least the Contrail revenue will be slower and gradual as it comes to the subscription nature of the revenue. So, some of our deferred revenue growth is Contrail and some of our other software products.","Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS.","Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. This is Tejas on for Steve. When I look at sequential routing growth in 4Q over the last few years, it's been up in certain years and down in certain years. But as we look into 4Q this year, is it fair to assume that it will grow similar to last year, given the CapEx trends you talked about earlier?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. I would expect both in Q2 and Q3 of this year we saw sequential growth across all technologies. I believe we're going to have a similar result in Q4. I do think we'll see some growth across many of the new products and all three of the technologies, routing, switching and security.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that is the product lineup that we have in routing today across the MX and the PTX with new line cards, new software that we've introduced on both those platforms in the first half of the year have set us up for a very, very competitive overall product portfolio that is going help us to grow going forward. So I just feel very good about the overall technology situation and our competitiveness of the company in routing.","Operator","Our next question...","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks for the question.","Operator","...comes from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Hi, Rami. I'd like to get your big picture views Rami, on how Juniper plans to drive new growth in optical and in security? For example, would you look to exit any current underperforming products and focus on new growth opportunities in security opticals such as data center optical interconnect, cloud based security as we saw, Akamai (38:57) seeing strength? I'd like to get your thoughts. Thanks, Rami.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Hi, Vijay. Thanks for the question. So both key areas of focus for us, I think that the work that Juniper did a year-and-a-half, two years ago, in streamlining and refocusing the company is really paying off for us today. So I do think that we are focused on the right areas or the right opportunities. And the growth potential in each of the areas that we're focusing on is definitely there. You touch on two of them. Optical is a really important part of our overall solution. We're not thinking about optical as a standalone business. I think there are enough standalone optical players in this world.","We think about optical as an element of a end-to-end solution with key emphasis on the metro and the data center interconnect markets. These are the opportunities that I think are ripe for disruption with a converged packet optical solution that's managed through really highly automated software. And I think that's the key behind the acquisition that we made of BTI. We now have the technology. We have the capability. We have the talent to enable us to integrate and develop these solutions for the data center interconnect and the metro market. And then in security, we've said it in the opening remarks. It's a business in transition. We continue to see the sequential momentum that we need to see in the business.","We have undertaken at the beginning of this year some very large somewhat tricky product transitions where we're replacing older security products with newer ones. And we're seeing good ramp-up in growth in the newer technologies that we've introduced in the market. So as I think about security, the opportunity is there. I think our vision of a software defined secure network is the right one. And we're hearing very good positive comments from our customers, our partners, as well as industry analysts. Our software efficacy is only getting better every quarter. And it really comes down to that last critical piece of refreshing the older portfolio with a newer portfolio that gives us the ability to compete from an economic standpoint, a cost per bit per second of security.","The QFX4100 and QFX4200 products we just announced at our Annual Customer Event a few weeks ago and they will be making their way into the market very shortly, and that's an example of that refresh cycle that I'm talking about. And you talked about cloud-based security. I do think that that is a direction of travel for security in the future. And this is why we're also investing in our virtual security products like the virtual SRX where we're seeing actually good momentum now offered off of the Amazon Web Services marketplace and as well as our ATP, our Advanced Threat Prevention, Sky ATP Service that's offered from the cloud. So these are indicative of investments today that we think will pay off in the second horizon of security which is all around the cloud.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Hey, thanks, Rami.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Vijay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Robert W. Baird.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask on SD-WAN you're highlighting it on your website. And Rami, is this \u2013 is it fair to say that this could impact MPLS router business to the negative but you have an opportunity with CPE in the branch? Or how should we frame SD-WAN as it relates to Juniper? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So we do view SD-WAN as a really important opportunity for us. But to be clear, we actually think of the SD-WAN opportunity maybe a little bit differently than our peers in the industry. We think of SD-WAN as just one point solution of a broad set of solutions that are \u2013 that enterprise customers will want and desire from telcos in the future. And so, when you look at our solution, it really is around an open platform that \u2013 the foundation of which is Contrail as an orchestration system and the NFX250 is essentially an open platform that sits at the customer prem. It can run a multitude of services, SD-WAN being one of them, security being a second one of them. Load balancing capabilities being a third one, et cetera, et cetera.","And we actually sort of define this vision a couple of years ago. And what we're seeing now from our customers is, a keen acceptance of this as being the true future that they want to go and to achieve. I think of this as highly complementary to our overall opportunity at Juniper. Our existing physical box centric sort of CPE business is relatively small unlike many of our competitors and so we can play a much more disruptive game there. And then to your question around does this have an impact on the MPLS-WAN space, if you will? I think a lot of these solutions will depend on a hybrid model where they will leverage the Internet for certain types of traffic as well as manage the MPLS for other types of traffic. All up, I think if you integrate the whole opportunity, I think it's a net add for us.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So most of them have been asked, but I kind of wanted to return real quick to the gross margin piece. If I recall correctly, I believe last quarter, the June quarter, the routing segment was part of the reason why the gross margins were actually better, or a little bit better. But now we're seeing a gross margin beat again. Or sorry, a routing beat again but the margins are going down. So is it fair to say that maybe the QFX (45:13) lower margin than 63% to 64% range?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","No. I wouldn't jump to that conclusion. I would say gross margin there are many, many inputs into gross margin from obviously pricing being a large one and I already mentioned pricing was actually relatively stable. We didn't see much change quarter-on-quarter as it relates to pricing. But product mix, and it's really at the level below just routing, switching, and security. It gets down to the product lines and even within the product lines whether it's chassis and line cards and a percentage of other commodity products within our solutions. So it's a volatile \u2013 it's a volatile product mix equation that does have propensity to go up or down a few tenths in any given quarter. We're pleased with our results in Q3. Very in line with what we expected to land, and that's really the update on gross margins.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I'd add it, typically with the introduction of new technologies, new products, the \u2013 they introduce a tailwind to gross margin. So the new QFX products relative to our overall switching business is in fact a positive thing, the exact same thing with routing, because what you're doing is you're leveraging Moore's Law, you're leveraging more modern silicon technology, et cetera, that tends to better optimize the cost per bit per second of your solution. So as you think about the types of things that we're looking at to achieve our long-term gross margin goals, there's supply chain managements and costs there. There's the innovation that goes with the introduction of new technologies that are tailwinds to gross margins. Then there's just innovation.","Take, for example, some of the work that we're doing in the optical space. In particular, the recent acquisition in silicon photonics, which will have not an immediate but a long-term, I think, positive effect on gross margin. And last but not least is business model transformation. As you think about the evolution towards more software-based business models, all of these things are factors that we believe will have a positive impact long-term on gross margins.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. On the QFX, can you discuss what success you're having with the cloud providers? And then how much of the QFX is shipping with 100-Gig and high-density ports?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure, Erik. Well, the success we're seeing with the QFX is broader-based than just cloud. And it's broader-based than just the top cloud providers. I think that the opportunity is large and it spans across cloud providers, cable operators, telcos and large enterprises. And we're leveraging all of our existing relationships with our customers but also of course going after net new opportunities with the QFX product line, which again I said, I believe is extremely competitive. And in particular, where you see Juniper taking the most share is in fact in the high speed opportunities, which is over 10-Gig, 100-Gig being a perfect sweet spot for us. So if you know Juniper, you know that where we do exceptionally well is where scale and performance matters. And where data centers require 100-Gig interfaces, typically the kinds of scale and performance they require for these data center buildouts are such that we're going to be very competitive. And that is a key area of differentiation for us today.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Notter of Jefferies.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to go back to the gross margin question. You said earlier that Juniper is out to take share in switching and cloud. And I think you were referencing more the QFX initiative in that statement. I guess I'm just wondering if I can connect to the gross margin erosion we've seen over the last handful of quarters to that initiative to take share? And then also I think last quarter you talked about some of the margin pressures really being focused in Europe. Is that still the case? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Let me start. And I'd like Ken to weigh in. The answer to the question is no, it's not just about the QFX. Our ability to take share certainly has an element of pricing to it. But it's much more than that. Technology matters. The broader portfolio solution matters. Things like Professional Services and our ability to go and to help our customers in evolving their networks from a legacy network to a cloud, highly automated data center with solutions like Contrail. All of these are factors. I'm not saying pricing is not a factor, but it's much more complicated than just pricing discussion. It's not just tied to switching, and it's not only tied to Europe. I think it's broader based than that. Right, Ken?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely. From a pricing perspective, specifically discounting, we did see some stabilization there this quarter as compared to last. You're right. In Q2 we did call out some elevated pricing pressure specifically in EMEA. So we're not calling out something similar this quarter. It's more broad based but also more stable than we saw last quarter from a pricing perspective.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Great. That helps. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rohit Chopra of Buckingham Research.","Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Guys, I just wanted you to address Government if you could? In the commentary, it appears that it was down sequentially in Routing, Switching and Security? So I was just wondering, is that a Government issue? Or is that a Juniper issue? Thanks.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So from a Government perspective, I'll let you talk about it a little bit, Rami, as well. But from a numbers perspective, we do see some lumpiness in the Government vertical. It's an important vertical for us, but it's not one of our largest couple of verticals, though it does have the propensity to be up or down on a certain deployment as they happen around the world. I would make sure folks understand that Government is an international vertical for us. So we do a fair amount of business internationally in Government sector as well. And what you saw in Q2 was actually a very strong Government number. And so sequentially we saw a little bit of a retraction but it's \u2013 we're still very focused on that vertical going forward. It's really more deployment based than anything else.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I'll add is that it remains a key vertical for us. We're highly focused on it. The deals in the Government space tend to be larger and therefore lumpier. And we did see some push out of opportunity, I think in particular around E-Rate and other types of government opportunities. So I'm not too concerned about the Q3 performance. I think we will see good success in that vertical going forward.","Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks, Rami.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. Thank you. You may begin.","Jess Lubert","Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risk factors, including those described in our most recent 10Q and 10-K, the press release and CFO commentary, furnished with our8-K filed day, and in other documents that we filed with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information could be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under financial reports. Revenue guidance is provided using ASC 605. We will adopt ASC 606 for Q1 2018 and intend to provide a ASC 606 to 605 reconciliation when we report first quarter results. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, is included in the press release, furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. ","Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim","Thank you, Jess. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported mixed results for the fourth quarter. While revenue and non-GAAP EPS were both above the midpoint of guidance, gross margins remained under pressure and we continued to experience weakness in both routing and in the cloud. This weakness is primarily being driven by the shift to a scale out from scale up architecture, most notably at several of our largest cloud customers, which appear likely to persist through at least the upcoming quarter. This shift is impacting our financial results by creating near term revenue headwind as new architectures take time to roll out and ramp. And margin pressures as we look to disrupt our own business with new lean core technologies that deliver both material efficiencies for our customers and price performance advantages versus competitive platforms.","Despite this ongoing headwind in a small number of hyperscalers, we remain confident in our position within the cloud vertical, where we have built substantial footprint with many large cloud providers over the past few years. This has been the result of our innovative products and also our close support of our cloud customers as they\u2019ve grown. As their growth continues, we believe it is clear that their network architectures need to evolve, and we're leading the charge to more automated, cost efficient, scalable networks. What's important is that we're confident in our belief that we continue to maintain our strong footprint as these shifts unfold and seeing solid demand for PT exports, which have already surpassed MX port shipments within the cloud vertical.","We continue to challenge the status quo, and while that at times result in short term disruption, similar to what we're currently seeing, we believe this approach will make us more relevant with our most important customer. With network traffic at our cloud customers seeing rapid growth, and many of these customers having already made significant progress in their architectural transition, we believe the headwinds impacting our Q1 outlook, are likely to prove transitory and expect to see sequential growth through the remainder of the year, with a return to year over year growth likely by the end of the year. ","We believe our optimism is supported by our deal pipeline, the opportunity our customers see with our new product innovation, and the momentum we're seeing with new accounts across various customer verticals. While much of my commentary has focused on the cloud vertical, it's important to highlight that we continue to gain relevance with our tier one telco and cable customers, and build momentum with strategic enterprise accounts, where we added nearly 3,500 new logos in 2017. Both of these remain important verticals that give me confidence in the long term opportunity and trajectory of the business.","Now I'd like to summarize the performance across routing, switching and security in Q4. In routing, our business declined sequentially and year over year. While this weakness was seen across product lines, due in large part to continued deployment delays at our largest cloud customers, new PTS footprint opportunities within the cloud, and continued MX demand in telecom and cable verticals, where service creation remains mission critical, continue to give us confidence in the longer term trajectory of our routing portfolio.","In switching, we saw double digit sequential growth in Q4, even though the business declined year over year. Normalized for lumpiness from our large hyperscale customers, our QFX product line continued to grow at double digit rates year over year. That growth is happening across public and private cloud segments, driven in part by 100 gig adoption. In addition, our innovative pipeline remains strong as evidenced by advancements in automation and telemetry, our leadership in network protocols like EVPN, as well as our fusion fabric solution that simplifies data center operations. We remain confident in the competitiveness of our QFX product line across all verticals, including cloud and hyperscalers. ","In Security, our business saw both sequential and year over year growth, driven by momentum in financial services, government and telco sales. More customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection and enforcement against cyber threats. We believe our Software-Defined Secure Network solution is gaining traction, and we've added many new customers in Q4 that are leveraging its benefits. Our improvement in Security was broad based across products and geographies, and we continue to see an uptick in million dollar plus deals, which is providing confidence our security business is likely to see a return to growth in 2018.","In the quarter, we continued to see momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins, including tier one carriers in both Europe and Asia, as well as recurring revenues from the renewal of existing annual subscription. We are executing on an extremely compelling product roadmap for Contrail that we expect will result in an expansion of its use cases across a broader set of customers.","We are also seeing success with our SD-WAN solution, which has already secured three tier one service provider wins, while the AppFormix customer base has steadily expanded across SaaS, enterprise and telecom operators. AppFormix and Contrail have been integrated for seamless operations management and advanced analytics of Juniper's hardware and software products in several customer use cases.","In Services, we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts, resulting in another quarter of year over year growth. We remain committed to all of our strategic verticals, especially the cloud and believe that we are more relevant than ever to our customers and the industry. We\u2019re innovating in ways that truly mattered to all network builders and operators that are embracing cloud architectures to drive greater levels of operating efficiency and service agility. I'm very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. ","In summary, while we're not satisfied with our second half 2017 results, or our outlook for Q1 2018, we're confident that we have the right strategy and solution portfolio needed to win in the market, and drive a return to growth by the end of 2018. Based on this confidence, we have announced a new $2 billion buyback authorization with the intention of initiating a $750 million ASR and an increase in our quarterly dividend by 80% to $0.18 a share.","I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I specially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders.","I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.","Ken Miller","Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. I'd like to start by discussing our fourth quarter performance and results. Our fourth quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS results were slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Total fourth quarter revenue was $.239 billion, down 11% year over year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.53. We continue to see architectural shifts in the cloud vertical impact our routing and switching businesses, which both declined year over year. However, Security was up both sequentially and year over year.","Our Services business continued to be solid, posting year over year and sequential growth, driven by strong renewal and attach rates. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were cloud, four were telecom or cable, and one was a strategic enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. ","Product deferred revenue was $334 million, up $11 million or 3% both year over year and sequentially. Product gross margins were below our expectations, primarily due to product mix as we had less routing revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses declined 6% year over year and 1% sequentially, reflecting a lower variable compensation, as well as our continued focus on managing expenses. As a percentage of revenue, fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were 38.6%.","In the quarter, we had good cash flow from operations of $214 million. We repurchased $330 million worth of shares and paid $37 million in dividends.","Moving on to the results for the full year. Fiscal 2017 saw modest revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth of 1%. Routing declined 7% due to ongoing architectural transitions in the cloud vertical. Our switching business had a record year, up 12% driven by QFX, which grew 25%. While Security declined 8% for the year, we did see sequential growth for the last three quarters and a return to year over year growth in the fourth quarter. Our Services business remained strong, growing 8% for the full year. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the Americas declined 1% and AMEA declined 3% for the year. However, Asia-Pac grew 13% in 2017. For the full year, Strategic Enterprise posted growth of 4%, cloud declined 1% and telecom and cable was flat. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, four were cloud, five were telecom or cable, and one was a strategic enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. ","Non-GAAP gross margin of 62% declined 120 basis points year over year, primarily due to lower volume, product mix and higher memory costs, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure and service margins. In 2017, we continue to focus on disciplined operating expense management, resulting in a non-GAAP operating expense decline of $17 million or 1%. Non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 39.1%. For the year, we had strong cash flows from operations of $1.260 billion, up $153 million from the previous year. We repurchased $720 million worth of shares, and paid $150 million in dividends. ","Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our Q1 revenue outlook reflects ongoing deployment delays as we expect our large cloud customers to continue the architectural transition. This is expected to result in below normal seasonality for the first quarter. As Rami discussed, this architectural transition is related to the evolution of these customers\u2019 networks to be more automated, cost efficient and scalable.","Despite this outlook, we remain confident in our competitive position and strong relationships with these strategic customers. While the timing of the architectural transitions we are experiencing is dynamic and somewhat uncertain, we expect revenue to grow on a sequential basis beyond the first quarter and a return to year on year growth by the end of the year. We expect gross margins for the quarter to remain under pressure due to lower volume and product mix, resulting from our customers architectural shifts.","There are many factors that impact gross margins, and while it is a dynamic environment, we expect full year margins to improve directionally from Q1 levels. We are undertaking specific efforts to address the pressure on our gross margins. These efforts included value engineering, optimizing our supply chain, pricing management and increasing software and solutions sales. Despite the reset of variable compensation and typical seasonal increase of fringe costs, we expect to manage our operating expenses prudently and to increase operational efficiencies, both in the first quarter and throughout the year.","For 2018, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings to be approximately 21%. The reduction in the projected tax rate is primarily driven by the change in US corporate income tax rate under the US Tax Cut and Jobs Act, partially offset by the net increase in the current tax of certain foreign earnings mandated by the act. Following the adoption of the US Tax Cut and Jobs Act, we plan to repatriate approximately $3 billion. We expect the new territory tax system to provide us lower cost access to nearly all of our global free cash flow on an ongoing basis. We intend to use the repatriated cash to invest in the business, support value enhancing M&A and fund our return of capital to shareholders.","I'm pleased to report our board of directors have approved a new $2 billion buyback authorization, including our intent to enter into a $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. In addition, they declared an increase of our quarterly cash dividend to $0.18 per share, to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. This reflects an increase of 80% compared to previous quarterly dividends.","In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions]. And our first question comes from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani"," Hi guys. Last quarter you had an issue also with some cloud customers. 0What I'm trying to understand this quarter is, when it comes to your guidance, can you distinguish between what could be perceived as share loss, maybe architectural decisions of customers that are not - at least not for now doesn't fit your portfolio and between just spending issues, because in your commentary you spoke mostly about spending rather than your own kind of situation within customers. Thanks. ","Rami Rahim","Hey Tal, it\u2019s Rami. Let me start. So the message that we delivered in the last quarter's earnings call, which was very much around confidence that we're both in the starting and ending phase of this - our architectural transition that we're going to - that we're seeing with our cloud customers, remains absolutely consistent here and now. So we fundamentally believe, based on the customer conversations that we're having, the work that we're doing on certifying certain products, the software that we're developing that has certain capabilities and features that are very much desired by our cloud customers, including the largest hyperscale customers, all lead us to have confidence that we will benefit from the recovery. ","So while it doesn't feel great to be right now in this situation where we're in the middle of this transition, I do firmly believe that we will benefit from the resumption in spending by cloud providers in a new architectural approach that is very different than the starting approach, one that is characterized with scale outs, one that leverages a new product, which is the PTX. Very fortunate and happy that we have technology like the PTX that can capture this transition and ensure that we maintain and even expand our footprint. So the net of it, Tal, is that I remain very confident that we will benefit from the resumption in spending and that this is not about a loss of share or footprint to the competition. ","Tal Liani","If I can ask one more question, just shifting gear to the MX. You speak about the PTX. In the past, the MX was very strong. Are you talking less about the MX now because of risk of competition with Arista? Or is it more about carrier spending, characteristics of carrier spending?","Rami Rahim","Yes. The MX is probably one of, if not the most successful routing platforms that\u2019s ever seen in the market across cloud, enterprise, telecom operators. It\u2019s just in a different phase of its life cycle than the PTX. The PTX is a newer product. I think many of our customers across verticals, but especially in the cloud vertical, see the benefits of having what we have described as a super core or a lean core architecture that enables them to deal with the incredible growth of traffic in their networks at a very cost optimized form factor and price point. And for that reason, we have seen a transition and will continue to see a transition with cloud providers from MX ports to PTX ports. That does have deflationary pressure on a pricing standpoint on per port basis. But the good news is, if you look at the cloud provider businesses that they have, if you look at the growth in the traffic that they are seeing, eventually I believe this pays off for us because we maintain the footprint and can capture that growth, albeit with a different product, which is the PTX. ","The MX in other verticals, so take telcos and enterprises for that matter, I think that transition to a PTX Is it's not going to happen anytime soon. It\u2019s going to be limited to a relatively small number of use cases, because typically where the MX is used in a telco scenario or an enterprise scenario, you're leveraging far more than IP packet transport. You\u2019re looking using its service delivery capabilities that just don't lend themselves to a migration to lean core architecture as easily. So most of that transition is going to happen in the cloud space, and a lot of that transition, as I mentioned in my starting commentary, is behind us already. ","Tal Liani","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Simon Leopold","Thank you very much. Just one quick clarification before I ask my question. You\u2019ve guided the share count for March to 360 million shares. What assumption are you making in that number for the buyback? Is that the full $750 million accelerated that you're assuming? I just want to make sure I understand that.","Ken Miller","Yes. This is Ken. So there are really two factors. One is we did just come off of a Q4 where we did $330 million of share repurchases. So we were opportunistic in Q4. So we\u2019re actually ending the year with less shares than we anticipated just 90 days ago. And second - the second factor is the one you mentioned is the ASR. So we're factoring in the impact to the ASR. You don't get full retirement immediately, but you get the majority of that impact in Q1.","Simon Leopold","So we should think about that even without assuming anything beyond that, the share count should be lower also in the June quarter than when you get the full impact, correct?","Ken Miller","Yes. Majority will happen in Q1. There\u2019ll be a follow up impact in Q2 and it will stay throughout the rest of the year at those lower levels.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thanks. So the question I want to ask is I know a difficult one to answer, but it's pretty key for I think folks to be able understand this transition product cycle around PTX adoption versus MX. And so you have I guess some substitution in your cloud vertical. We\u2019re often asked, what's the price difference between a PTX and an MX? And so we know the purport pricing is lower. You just mentioned that, Rami. Can you help explain this and how people should think about modeling when you've got this kind of product transition where there is ASP pressure, but probably some change in the number of ports that would be shipping in this transition. Thank you. ","Rami Rahim","Yes. I appreciate the question, Simon and it is a difficult one to answer. So I\u2019m - honestly I'm not going to answer it. I will say the following, which is that there is a meaningful price difference between the PTX and the MX. And you have to think of this from the standpoint of, we've been talking about the fact that routing and switching are essentially kind of blending over time. And the PTX is a perfect example of that manifesting itself in a new product. So there is a meaningful price difference, but where it's used, typically it's used in areas where there is tremendous scale, and massive increase in traffic. And that's what we're seeing in the cloud provider space. So I can tell you that although overall revenue in the cloud providers is going to be under pressure as we go through the transition, we are going to be selling substantially more ports, albeit PTX ports, in some cases QFX ports, than we did with the MX product historically.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal from Instinet. Please go ahead. ","Jeffrey Kvaal","Yes, thank you very much and Jess, welcome to the battle. I guess two questions if I may. One, Ken for you. I think, could we delve into the gross margin issue a little bit? To sharpen the question a little bit. In the - in early 2016, you were delivering not that different revenue, $1.1 billion or so and yet the gross margins were going to be 600 basis points higher then than they look likely to be this year, two years later. So that's a big shift and I\u2019m wondering if you could help us unpack that. And then for Rami, you mentioned M&A and obviously that was a little bit of a topic, both on what you may be interested in purchasing. And also of course there is a whole slew of Nokia discussions in December. So any comments that you have related to M&A would be helpful. Thank you. ","Ken Miller","Sure. So I\u2019ll take the gross margin question first. So there are many factors that impact gross margin as you know. And as it relates to the guidance of 58% plus or minus one, the Q1 guidance, really I think the easiest way to explain it would be to kind of bridge it from the Q4 levels. So think to 63.5%, 62% kind of level. Really there are three primary drivers in the decline, all of which are putting pressure on the margin itself. The first one is lower volume. So the revenue guide is a couple of hundred million less than the Q4 level. So that does have an impact on gross margin when you do that bridge. It\u2019s just a factor of fixed cost as a percentage of total revenue. ","The second factor is really the continuing product technology mix. So we've been talking about technology mix for a while. Think routing to switching. As routing is actually taking a bigger burden of the revenue decline, as a percentage of our total revenue, routing is down and that's also having a headwind to margin. And last but not least would be actually product mix within routing. So we talked a lot about the architectural shifts and a lot of that is MX to PTX from a scale up to scale out architecture. While the PTX margins are very healthy and actually above the corporate average, they are below our MX margin. So I do think that's another contributing factor into our margin guide. As Rami mentioned, it\u2019s important to note that some of that is behind us. 50% of our PTX exports are actually substantially more than 50% of our PTX ports that we shipped in \u201817 to the cloud vertical, or PTX ports I should say. So that's a good story. We do expect margin to directionally be up. We think the full year levels will be up off of these Q1 - of this Q1 guide.","Rami Rahim","Jeff, let me answer your first question or your second question around M&A. first, let me say that the fact that we've put in place what we view as a good capital allocation policy and strategy now, it should be a sign that we have confidence that some of the challenges that we're going through right now in terms of this architectural transition, are in fact transitory. Having said that, I think we have a healthy balance sheet, especially now with repatriation of foreign cash. And I have been consistent in saying that we will continue to look for value enhancing M&A, and it would be very much in areas that would accelerate our existing strategy. ","I don't believe that we need a new strategy. We\u2019ve developed a strategy that very much respects the major trend that's happening in our industry, which is around the cloud. This is not just about serving the cloud providers, but helping our telco customers and the enterprise customers in moving to a multi cloud environment, with easy management automation and security. So these are sort of the areas that we would look for to accelerate the - our execution with value enhancing M&A that we're already working on today. Thank you.","Jess Lubert","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.","Ittai Kidron","Thanks. I wanted to dig in again into the gross margin. Maybe you can give us some color on the impact of volume on margins. How much of the fact that you missed the - that you're missing the cloud volume is impacting pricing of other products? Meaning, are you now at a point where volumes that you are purchasing from suppliers are below levels such that pricing of the components that you buy is rising?","Ken Miller","Yes. So I mean volume as it relates to our fixed cost versus variable cost, is a big factor. I listed as the first primary factor, but it's really not impacting our purchasing power and our contract manufacturers. We have longer term contracts with our contract manufacturer providers and it doesn't have a quarter to quarter impact based on volume. So when I mention volume here, I'm really alluding to our actual standard margin is higher than our average gross margin because of some of the fixed cost components that get included into the gross margin math.","Ittai Kidron","Okay. And then second, just follow up on the tax rate, the 21%. I would have hoped it would be lower. I guess I'm trying to understand why not just by blending your - the mix of your operating profits international versus US, you won\u2019t get to a lower rate. Can it go lower from here or this is the level set following the tax rule?","Ken Miller","Yes. So this is a level we're going to - we expect given the new tax rule. The big difference with just simply the blended approach that you mentioned, is we\u2019re actually going to have a US tax on international earnings of roughly 10% in the new tax reform rules. So I think that's probably the piece you\u2019re missing. So that results in the 21% expectation for this year.","Ittai Kidron","Very good. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tim Long","Thank you guys. Two questions if I could. Can we talk a little bit about the switching here and the transitions going on there? Maybe just give us a little color on the move to 100G and maybe a little update on how you\u2019re doing on core as opposed to the edge market. And then separately, on the telco vertical, just the traditional telcos, it sounds like that was pretty decent in the quarter. Rami, could you just talk a little bit about what you're expecting from that vertical as operators start to set their budgets for 2018? Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Certainly, Tim. So I\u2019ll start with switching. So our switching business first has two components to it. There\u2019s the campus business and the data center business, the first being the EX product line, the second the QFX. We\u2019ve said now that QFX have exceeded the EX. So data center dominates the use case that we are pursuing and where the business momentum is. We\u2019re very pleased with our all up switching business growth last year, and in particular the QFX which grew 25% year over year. ","And if you break apart the QFX business, it has a broad based component that feeds its way into large enterprises, telcos, data centers and smaller type cloud providers. That has consistently had solid momentum throughout last year, and I expect it to have that momentum through 2018 as well, growing at essentially double digit year over year growth on a consistent, quarterly basis. Then there is a much more concentrated hyperscaler component to our QFX business, and that's going to very much follow these transitions from 40 to 100 gig that we've talked about over the last couple of quarters. So there is going to be some cyclicality to the QFX data center business as we work through these transitions. And I do think that there is an opportunity for us to break into more hyperscale switching opportunities throughout the year. I mean that is a big area of focus for us. ","On the telco side, it's really more of the same in terms of market dynamics. I think our telco customers continue to run their networks harder and are getting more comfortable with that. They themselves are moving towards cloud oriented service delivery models, and we leverage that with products like Contrail, our switching portfolio and our virtual network functions. There is - there are some headwinds due to M&A consolidation that's happening in the telco space. So we're not expecting any breakthrough growth from telco anytime in the near future at this point. Looking out a little bit further as you get into 5G, as you get into the build up necessary to support 5G traffic, especially in the metro, I do view that as an opportunity. But we have to sort of temper our expectations because I do think that this market is going to be somewhat challenging, at least for the foreseeable future. ","Tim Long","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Paul Silverstein","Appreciate it. A couple of questions if I might. First off, if you said earlier, my apologies, but Rami, can any share losses whatsoever beyond your potential transition that you all cited?","Rami Rahim","Sorry. Are there any share losses whatsoever? Let me say this. I know this is sort of top of mind for all of you guys, but I was - I am very confident that where we have the major footprint across our large customers, especially in the cloud space, I feel like we have the right customers around the technology and understanding what's required to maintain that footprint, and to continue to grow in that footprint. And not only that, to actually expand into new opportunities. So it's not just a game of defense where we\u2019re trying to hold on to what we have and leverage the growth in those areas, but we are very much playing offence and trying to steal footprint away from the competition. That\u2019s the way I view the competitive landscape today. Since joining Juniper now over 20 years ago, I can tell you that the one constant element to that period of time has been it's a very competitive landscape across all of our vertical market segments. And we're comfortable operating in a very competitive landscape.","Paul Silverstein","Rami, appreciate that. Just to be clear, relative to the architectural transition that you're citing in terms of the near term weakness, you don't believe that you all had any meaningful share losses at those several hyperscale customers, the several cloud customers.","Rami Rahim","Yes. I agree with what you just said. We do not believe so.","Paul Silverstein","All right. Two quick questions if I might. You cited an increase, I believe you said on a normalized basis, excluding the cloud architectural transition for PTX. I\u2019m just a little bit confused. I would think - it sounds like PTX, or at least I thought that PTX wasn't impacted, is actually going to benefit from the architectural transition, but on the comm as those folks displace MX with PTX. So why was PTX an issue in terms of you're citing it on a normalized basis, with the implication being that it's declined year over year not normalized in terms of full impact. And then Ken, a question for you in OpEx. I think I heard you say you\u2019ll manage OpEx prudently or efficiently throughout the year. Can you translate that for us in terms of your expectations for the year? Do we expect OpEx to be flat, to be down, to be up modestly? Any insight you can provide will be appreciated. Appreciate it guys.","Rami Rahim","Paul, let me start with the PTX question and then Ken, you can jump in on the OpEx question. So I'm not concerned at all about the performance of the PTX in 2017 and going into 2018. There will be lumpiness to the PTX that are very much tied to large scale deployments in the cloud provider space especially. But all up, I mean Q3 was a record quarter for the PTX. Looking at the opportunities that we're working on with the large hyperscalers, as well as some telcos, there is an opportunity to see meaningful growth in the PTX this year relative to last year. So I'm much less concerned about what this is going to do on a quarter over quarter basis, and much more looking at the opportunities of where - that we've won already and the build outs that are already in progress. Ken?","Ken Miller","Yes. From an OpEx perspective, first of all, I want to note, we are pleased with our Q4 results. I mean, we did come in below the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to our headcount related costs, as well as some lower variable compensation. As we look ahead, we're not going to provide full year guidance. We did provide Q1 guidance of 45, plus or minus five, which is even with the fringe reset, as well as the variable comp reset. I think that shows you that we are very focused on OpEx discipline and will remain disciplined. We are - over the long term, we\u2019re looking to expand operating margins. In a down revenue environment, I would say that we will also manage OpEx down. We\u2019re not going to be able to perhaps match it one for one, but we are going to be very focused on OpEx as we move throughout the year and we see the revenue start to hit the quarters.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Milunovic from UBS. Please go ahead. ","Steve Milunovic","Thanks. Rami, did the timing of this architectural shift change in the last quarter? I think last quarter you were talking about the switching side coming back relatively quickly, and you did see sequential growth. But I don't know if it's coming back as quickly as you expected, and similarly if the routing is now extending out weaker, deeper into the year than you previously thought. ","Rami Rahim","Yes, it's a good question, Steve. I don't think that it's playing out exactly as we had expected. I think that when you're trying to do forecasting in - on a set of products that have a very high degree of customer concentration, you only need to sort of get it wrong for a couple of customers to get the overall forecast wrong or the timing wrong. So generally speaking, based on our Q1 outlook, it's fair to say that the transition has taken a little bit longer than what we initially expected. Having said that, we're no longer sort of at the beginning of the transition, looking out and trying to predict it in that way. We\u2019re sort of in the middle of it, and you can see that just from the port mix that we're now selling into the large cloud providers today, where the PTX has already exceeded pretty substantially the MX ports that we're selling into that market segment.","Ken Miller","Yes, I would just add, I mean I do think we expect switching to be a growth driver for us. We expect switching to return to growth in the second half and actually be full year growth for FY\u201918. We\u2019re also very pleased with the momentum we\u2019re seeing in security. We had our first year on year growth quarter in a while and we expect that FY\u201918 to be a year of security growth for us on a full year basis. But routing, given the transition and the difficulty in coming - understanding, when does it come back and when it\u2019s going to come back in enough volume to offset some of the headwinds, I think it's reasonable to expect routing to be down on a full year basis in FY\u201918.","Steve Milunovic","The growth in Asia Pacific, was that new insertions and do you expect growth to continue?","Rami Rahim","I'm super proud of our APAC team for the momentum that they've demonstrated over the last couple of years in what is a very competitive landscape. And I do think that there are opportunities to continue the momentum into 2018, yes. We\u2019ve been talking now for the last year about strategic insertions and particular in China. And our expectation is that those will start to pay off at some point this year.","Steve Milunovic","Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question is from Patrick Newton from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Newton","Good afternoon, Rami and Ken. I guess I'm trying to piece together your goal of returning year over year growth exiting the year and weighed against security growing year over year, switching growing year over year and then routing not growing. So is it right to think that return of end of year growth is really the 4Q timeframe and also the 3Q year over year growth are very small? And once this transitory architecture headwind is complete, it sounds like even with your routing outlook, that we should expect only tepid year over year growth in 4Q. Just want to make sure I'm kind of piecing together all the parts correctly.","Rami Rahim","Yes. No, I would look at it as when we talk about sequential growth and then returning to year on year growth by the end of the year, I would think Q4 is right timeframe and that's all up. That\u2019s an all up comment, not necessarily particular to any technology. We do think the routing transition, although we're - I would phrase, we're in the middle of it, there's still a fair amount of disruption that's going to cause the FY\u201918 number from a routing perspective as we continue to finish up the transition and hopefully set us up for growth beyond this year. But I think this year routing, we expect to be down given this current visibility we have and our expectations of the timing of the transition.","Patrick Newton","All right. and then taking that answer and starting out with your 40, or 58% gross margin and margin marching up sequentially through the year, is it fair to assume that given the impact of greater PTX and switch mix, that gross margin in 4Q\u201918 would still likely be below your 4Q \u201817 levels?","Rami Rahim"," Yes. Again, not going to get that specific out for quarters. I'm really focused on making sure we get our more visible quarters predicted correctly. I will say this. I do think that we expect revenue to grow. Therefore, I think it's a reasonable assumption that we\u2019re making that the margin should also grow directionally. I want to make sure that there is going to be deal mix and customer mix. It\u2019s difficult to predict when you get out to any particular quarter, but we do believe margin should recover from the Q1 levels by the time we exit the year.","Patrick Newton","Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, Rami, Ken. My question is really around competition in routing as we head into 100 gig and perhaps 400 gig routing from suppliers such as Arista in particular. How do you compete in a situation where your competition would use high density 100 gig, 400 gig platforms with the competition being feature performance, perhaps pricing? So help us understand the competitive strategy in routing as new entrants come into that marketplace? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks for the question. Again, I'll just reiterate that routing has always been an incredibly competitive market. And we recognized several years ago that in order to continue to compete effectively in the routing space, we're going to need to have a new breed of routing platform. And that's when we conceived of this idea of a lean core architecture, which is defined by this product that we call the PTX. It's a good thing we did that because I think our situation today would be very different if we did not have that product and the ability to transition what is the most demanding customer, our cloud customers toward these new lean core architectures. That said, so I think that the concept was right. The execution was right on. ","Now, all we need to do is to ensure that we maintain the competitive differentiation on an ongoing basis. And we will do that with the roadmap that we have in terms of software technologies that give our customers the ability to obtain telemetry and information from these systems, which is extremely important to the cloud in particular, to enable logical scale that is best in class across the industry today. And our goal is to ensure that that is - it stays that way in the future and increasingly with optics. I think that the investments that we're making in the optical space is essentially a way for us to compete on the economics of networking beyond just the IP based routing, but the integrated optical technology that I think is becoming more and more important to our customers. So all this is to say that I'm very confident that we have the right investments in place and the innovation to deal with a very competitive environment in routing.","Operator","Our next question from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Two real quick ones if I can. Just going back to the guidance and the ability to kind of grow - return to growth exiting the calendar year, aside from kind of port shipment transitions or inflections within your large cloud customers, I'm curious, are you assuming in that scenario that some of your cloud customers reach the inflection from a revenue standpoint in terms of the MX to PTX router transition? And then I have a quick follow up. ","Ken Miller","Yes. So I just want to clarify. The sequential growth that we are expecting and the return to year on year growth is not a particular customer set or a particular technology. It\u2019s really more of a Juniper overall revenue. We do have a broadening base in our switching business that Rami mentioned where we're seeing a lot of very consistent growth, double digit growth. In fact, if you normalize for the hyperscalers within the QFX, we believe security can continue to grow consistently going forward. We\u2019re still in a bit of a turnaround there, but we're seeing signs of growth there and expect growth throughout FY\u201918. So the comment I'm making is not particular to this transition. It\u2019s more broader - it's broader than that.","Aaron Rakers","Okay, fair enough. And then just on the gross margin line again, looking at the guidance of 58% plus or minus in the quarter, it looks like you're guiding more or less product gross margin to be in that mid 50% range. First of all, am I correct in that assumption? And second to that, do you believe that as you kind of transition that gross margin on a product side, can they get back to a 60% plus level? Thank you. ","Ken Miller","Yes. So we don't all break it out for you, but I will say that it's - the service business does carry a fair amount of people costs and the reset of variable cost and fringe will have an impact on our service margin as well. Again, not going to give you the specifics, but I do think there's going to be a bit of a decline in both for Q1 off of Q4 levels. Back to the longer term margin, there's a lot of factors. I think we talked a little bit about what we're doing internally. There\u2019s a big focus internally on innovation and making sure we do the value engineering work. We need to be cost competitive."," Optimizing the supply chain is something we continue to focus on. Pricing discipline is - I know the field is growing at a new pricing discipline and I think it\u2019s going to pay off for us in the long run, as well as just increasing our software and solutions sales. There\u2019s a lot of efforts underway to return the margin to growth. I also think probably the biggest single factor is going to be getting through this transition. Although the margin impact is largely being felt as now and this quarter and perhaps over the short term here, as we get through this transition, I think that will give us the opportunity to grow margin beyond these current levels.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead. Jim, you're on. Perhaps you\u2019ll be on mute by accident. And we\u2019ll move on to the next question from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mitch Steves","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know you guys can't provide the exact number, but just to get our handle around kind of full year revenue. So for the entire company, routing is going to be down just given the material miss for the first quarter. Is it fair to assume the entire company revenue should be down on a year over year basis for \u201918?","Ken Miller","Yes. I think our expectation is to grow sequentially and return to growth late in the year. I believe it's reasonable to model that it could be a down year in full year revenue basis, based on what we see now, predominantly because of the routing shortfall.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark Moskowitz","Thanks. Good afternoon. A question and then a clarification. On the clarification, when you talk about the return to year over year revenue growth ending \u201918, is that predicated more on new logo penetration versus a recovery in your existing logos? And then Rami for you, on the cloud re-architecting here, that transition, when the transition is over, is there any risk that you could actually see less content sold into each environment or provider because of their efficiencies that they're trying to achieve?","Ken Miller","Okay. So let me answer the second one first, on the cloud transition. This kind of pricing inflection point that is happening from the MX to the PTX, is not one that I expect to happen again anytime in sort of the foreseeable future in a cloud or anywhere else. I do think that what we're seeing now is somewhat unique just by virtue of the fact that there is truly this architectural shift that's enabled by a new breed of routing platform that blends the line with switching, and that just doesn't happen all that often. So I think once we get through it, assuming that the cloud providers, especially the large hyperscalers, will need to continue to deal with growth in their businesses, which I would bet is the case for years to come, then we will benefit for that exiting 2018.","Rami Rahim","Yes. From a customer perspective, I mean the answer is both. I mean we focus on growing our current customers, both as they grow, as well as getting new footprint into existing customers. And clearly we have a big focus on new logos as well, expanding our customer base, particularly in the enterprise, in some of those verticals where we have opportunity to expand further. ","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much. Hopefully this is better. I believe back in 2017 in the early part of the year, the cloud was a big beneficiary to you if my memory is correct. And then the second half unfolded and became a bigger headwind, preannouncements lowering, and now you're talking about visibility as people transition through this architecture. So I want to kind of take a look back and see, did you see this second half headwind coming? And if so, not so great. If not, just let us know. But also, what type of confidence do you have that this transition will come to pass where you're going to come out of this okay? Because it seems like the second half of the year was much worse than expected. ","Ken Miller","Yes. Hi Jim. It\u2019s a good question. I think that it's true. We have been benefiting from Cloud growth now for several years, right not just in the first part of 2017, but even for a few years behind that. As a result of that strength, we saw our market share in core routing, and particular North America, start to grow meaningfully over that time period. What we're doing now, I know it sort of feels painful and it's not the most fun thing to do from a quarterly results standpoint, but it is absolutely the right thing to do. We\u2019re essentially making sure that we disrupt ourselves and maintain the footprint that we have built to date so that we can benefit from the next wave of spending by the cloud providers. I mean that's what it really comes down to. ","As far as our ability to see it, we certainly saw it at a macro level because we build products for it, right? But did we predict the timing and the magnitude of the disruption in the transition? I\u2019d say no, I don't think we predicted either of those things as well as I would have liked. But I think the most important thing is, I have the confidence that we will benefit from maintaining the footprint that we have as we get back into growth. And there is absolutely this goal that I mentioned earlier to expand into new opportunities and new footprints among the cloud providers, in particular in the data center.","Rami Rahim","Operator, we\u2019ll take two more questions.","Operator","And our next question is James Kisner from Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","James Kisner","Thank you. So just digging into one of your customer segments, strategic enterprise, I mean obviously that's pretty strong result here and acceleration. Were there any large deals that helped there? I\u2019m just kind of wondering if that - we should expect that elevated growth rate in that segment to continue? Thanks>","Rami Rahim","Yes. So I'm actually very pleased with the momentum that we've built in the enterprise space. In Q4, we saw in double digit year over year growth and sequential growth. There\u2019s been a concerted effort to really go after new logos. We added 3,500 new enterprise logo in the 2017 timeframe, and I believe that will continue. It\u2019s not - there is a little bit of customer concentration, but for the most part, it's broad based. And we're definitely innovating in a way that makes us more relevant to the enterprise, with the goal of diversifying our business more in the enterprise space. ","And just to give you an example of that. Contrail, which has been the SDN controller that we've developed initially primarily for large cloud and telco customers, is now essentially being repackaged in a way that solves some very meaningful enterprise problems, in particular multi cloud management and multi cloud security. The feedback that we've gotten thus far on this product direction has been phenomenal and we see some real opportunities to maintain, if not increase the momentum in the enterprise space with these technologies. ","Operator","And our final question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","James Faucette","Great. Thanks. I just had a couple of questions. First, Ken, I recognize the difficulty in trying to forecast margins a year out, but can you help us think about like what the puts and takes would be that would allow you, not only to return to revenue growth year over year by the fourth quarter, but potentially even be flat or maybe up a little bit from an earnings perspective? And then maybe more broadly for you both Rami and Ken is that, you talk about that you want to be seen as, and you feel like you want to be aggressive in new opportunities, but right now you're continuing to manage OpEx and it\u2019s continuing to decline as your revenues are pressured. But all of your competitors around you are increasing their R&D to attack a lot of the same opportunities you're eyeing. So at what point, either from a time perspective or a revenue recovery perspective, should we expect you to start to match some of your competitors in terms of increasing your investment in R&D, et cetera? Thanks a lot. ","Rami Rahim","Hey James. Let me start with the question around investments, and then Ken, I\u2019ll let you address the first question. I'm an R&D guy. So I spent many years here developing the technologies, many of which are in the market today. So I have a good feel for this and I think that we have the right investments in the right areas. The key is focus. The key is ensuring that we remain incredibly focused, in particular on the cloud opportunity. And we're developing the technologies that make us even more relevant toward that opportunity across all of our key market segments. R&D investment as a percentage of revenue for us is actually quite healthy, if you compare us to our peers. So the net of it is I'm not concerned about our ability to invest in the areas in a very focused manner to maintain our competitive differentiation across all of our technologies\/","Ken Miller","Yes. And from an earnings perspective, clearly our goal is to grow earnings over the long term. Given the kind of color that we provided on both revenue and gross margin, as well as OpEx for the year, I think it is reasonable to presume that EPS will be down on a full year basis, unless we see a stronger recovery of the revenue than we currently are projecting our models. From a - does it get to positive in Q4? I think that's clearly - it's too early to call at this point. Clearly our goal is to get to earnings growth sooner rather than later.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.","Rami Rahim","Thank you, everyone for your questions. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here on the call are: Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; and Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Platform Systems Division. In addition, Bob Muglia, Executive Vice President, Software Solutions division, is on the call and will be available for Q&A.","Before we continue, I would like to highlight changes to our reporting segments, which are reflected in today's press release. Juniper made changes  to better align our business segment reporting to our current organizational structure. Security products previously reported in our Platform Systems Division, PSD segment, are now reported in our Software Solutions Division, SSD segment. Juniper believes  this change will provide investors with increased financial reporting transparency and will enable better insight into the trends driving our business. A summary showing PSD and SSD quarterly revenues on a basis consistent with the new reporting structure is included in Appendix 1 of today's press release.","Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic condition, generally or within the networking industry; changes in overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and major customers; the network capacity requirements of service providers; the timing of orders and shipments; manufacturing and supply chain constraints; variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products; rapid technological and market change; litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-K filed with the SEC.","All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call.","In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and, for the purposes of today's discussion, we'll also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today.","For a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.","On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimate.","Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour, and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin R. Johnson","Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Our results for the first quarter are in line with the guidance we shared with you on our January conference call. We are off to a good start to 2013, with strength in key markets and some signs of improving demand trends. To be sure, there are headwinds in certain areas of our business, but overall, we executed well against the priorities we outlined last quarter.","I'll review the performance of our 2 market segments. Service provider was a good story for us in Q1, with our third consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Sequential results reflected anticipated first quarter seasonality. The U.S. market for routing continues to strengthen as we anticipated, while Verizon and AT&T were 10% customers for us in the quarter, and we continue to see good demand trends with Tier 1 service providers and other verticals, like content providers and cable. APAC and EMEA were weaker in the quarter, though we are seeing signs of modest improvement in demand in service providers in Europe.","Enterprise is a more challenging market at present, with flat year-on-year performance. A lot of the challenge stems from weak public sector spending, in particular U.S. federal, along with softness in financial services. We have communicated steadily over the last several quarters about expected weakness in federal. We do not expect this pattern to improve in the near term. While the Enterprise market has seen challenges across several verticals in recent periods, we are committed to continue investment across our businesses of routing, switching and security, and we are confident in our products and our roadmap.","I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing 3 specific areas of focus at Juniper: Service Provider routing, data center and security. Routing was a highlight in the quarter, with particular strength in U.S. carrier. The content and cable segments of U.S. Service Provider also showed good momentum. We are seeing continued signs that Service Provider CapEx is improving at a time when our portfolio of new routing products are being well-received by our customers. We continue to expand our reach in edge routing, and we are seeing good customer engagement in the core. We are building on our heritage in Service Provider innovation, delivering the most complete and differentiated portfolio in our history, most recently with the release of the MX2020.","Data center. Our Switching business also performed well in the quarter. We continue to be confident in our opportunity, notwithstanding current macro challenges, particularly as we see the QFabric family of products gaining more traction. We're also introducing new products in our EX line, including the EX9200 launched earlier this month. The EX9200 is the industry's most advanced programmable core switch and will support future software-defined networking protocols in emerging applications, both in data center, as well as campus and branch environments.","Security. Despite disappointing results in Security in Q1, we believe we are taking the right steps to improve the business. We recently released Security Director, which is being well-received by customers. In addition, there are 3 pillars to our security strategy. In Service Provider, it's about leveraging and extending what we believe is a strong position. We continue to scale the high-end SRX to handle a large number of concurrent sessions, which differentiates us in the Service Provider LTE deployments. In the data center, we just announced a refresh of features, including a new capability called Spotlight. We believe this provides us unique differentiation in the data center. We have strong engagements, and we are focused on turning those into customer wins. In Campus and Branch, we still have work to do, but we have a focused strategy for building an increasingly robust product in feature portfolio and regaining share.","Wrapping up, we had a solid start to the year. Execution is improving and that shows in the results. We retain our strong conviction in our opportunity. We believe Juniper is well-positioned to address a very good long-term growth market. Near term, we are confident in our ability to return to growth in Service Provider and strengthen our Enterprise business.","Our new products continue to gain traction, and we are committed to investing in innovation with a more robust portfolio that can be leveraged across both Service Provider and Enterprise markets. Overall, we are staying true to our 2013 operating principles and are focused on delivering great products, maintaining our focus on operational execution and managing costs carefully. The underlying trends driving network investment remain strong, and I'm confident of Juniper's position for future success.","I'll turn it over now to Rami to discuss highlights from our Platform Systems Division. Rami?","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Kevin. It's a pleasure to join the earnings call this quarter. I took over as EVP\/GM of the Platform Systems Division, PSD, in November of 2012. I'm responsible for driving strategy, development and business growth for Juniper's portfolio of routing, switching and wireless LAN products, as well as for the ongoing evolution of our silicon technology and the Junos operating system.","Overall, I'm pleased with PSD's results in Q1 2013. Kevin covered the results at a high level, so what I'd like to do is walk through some of the drivers behind the quarter's results and put them in context.","Our 5 key focus areas when it comes to our platforms are: core, Universal Edge and Universal Access on the Service Provider side; the campus on the Enterprise side; and the virtualized data center, which spans both Service Provider and Enterprise.","In the Service Provider business, growth was driven by the business edge and broadband edge segment, where we're seeing wins around the world with large service providers driving broadband deployment. We also recently introduced the MX2020 in a 2 x 100 gb line cards, which we expect to begin ramping as we head through the year. While the overall market for the core declined during 2012, we have seen a solid ramp-up of the PTX product family and the recent introduction of T4000 multichassis in the segment.","In the core, Juniper has always been a leader in performance. Today, we have a three-pronged innovation strategy to go after the market that plays out to our strength and gives us a unique opportunity to win. With the PTX, we've defined a new product category, which is a packet-oriented transport device that moves packets through the network more efficiently than any other system in the world. As an example of PTX's capability, consider that it has approximately 4x the power efficiency of its nearest competitor. In keeping with our goal to drive the benefits of the converged supercore to the broadest set of customers, last month, we introduced the PTX3000, which is well suited for smaller core than metro core because of its form factor. It's less than a foot deep. It fits in environments and locations where a traditional core router would not. It provides transport level  resiliency and performance, an important first step towards full-packet optical conversion. Market recognition and customer feedback has been very enthusiastic, and we're on track to ship in the second half of this year.","The second important element of our core strategy consists of the T series, which remains the best investment protection story in the industry. This platform started shipping a decade ago, but still has very high-density line cards today, roughly twice the density of our primary core competitor. And as I mentioned, the recent introduction of the T4000 multichassis product only strengthens this platform's value proposition.","And the last weapon in our core arsenal is the MX. With the MX, we have the ability to introduce a core product that's very service-rich, and in so doing, we've blurred the lines between the traditional edge of the network and the traditional core layer of the network and provided a product that extends services through software deeper into the network. The MX continued to show strength in the year-over-year revenue growth. And with the MX2020 and high-performance line cards now shipping, I expect that, that momentum will continue.","So I think the combination of these 3 core technologies really gives us the ability to set the agenda and go after a broader core market opportunity.","In the Edge, I believe that we have a significantly differentiated Universal Edge platform. We've got significant traction in the business edge services, great traction in residential edge services and deployed mobile net software that's moving 4G packets in live networks today. The diversity of applications in use cases has and continues to be one of the biggest selling points of the MX product family. In fact, we are now seeing more operators leveraging the MX Universal Edge to converge their Edge network by running multiple services simultaneously. As an example, we're working with a Tier 1 operator to converge residential services, business services, aggregation and video delivery services onto a single MX network.","The third area is in the access, which is a really important area and an opportunity for growth for Juniper. Our goal is quite simple: to extend the success that we've seen in the Universal Edge by pushing that concept into the access. Leading operators who have built access networks optimized for 3G and voice have recognized that 4G essentially changes everything, and a new approach to building their access network is fundamentally required. Juniper has built a cost-effective access product that provides the capacity that's necessary to converge business, residential and mobile services onto a common access infrastructure. With the ACX family that we introduced last year, we offered a system that provides leading price performance, market-leading timing technology and also some really interesting environmental hardening characteristics. In Q1 2013, we started shipping the ACX4000, which is optimized to enhance the mobile subscriber experience while significantly improving network monetization for service providers.","Another area that I want to touch on is the data center, and this is really another very interesting area for us. SDN is all about introducing agility into the network to keep pace with the rate of change in the compute world. We recognized these trends early when we introduced fabric technologies like QFabric. We are seeing that the adoption of -- for QFabric has started to go up because customers are recognizing the values and because we've introduced a new version of the QFabric catering smaller data centers and data center pods. Gartner recently recognized our innovation by positioning Juniper as a visionary in their data center network infrastructure Magic Quadrant in February 2013.","We are doing well in the campus where we saw good year-over-year wireless LAN growth, especially in Asia Pacific where we had our largest wireless LAN win ever. We continue to build our Enterprise portfolio with the launch of the EX9200 Programmable Switch shipping now. The new EX9200 is the industry's most programmable core switch, which offers the flexibility required to support current and future protocols, emerging applications and is optimized for both campus and data center environments. We also announced the JunosV wireless LAN controller, which is delivered as software within a virtual machine offering the same functionality as the appliance-based hardware wireless LAN controllers, contributing to a unified redundant platform and location-agnostic wireless control plan for the end-to-end Enterprise. And we announced Junos Space Network Director, a network management application that provides unified manageability for the campus, fixed  and wireless. And we plan to extend that to data center later this year.","So with all that said, I summarize as follows: we are not confused by the fact that innovation in this area depends on our ability to really move the needle in our silicon technology, our systems and in our software. All 3 are fundamental to managing the types of traffic, capacity increases and service increases that our customers need. I think we're well-positioned in the edge and core with our portfolio today. I think that we have an ability to really grow and expand our Universal Edge leadership position into the access layer, and finally, I do believe that we've got some great building blocks both on the Platform side and the Software side to build a truly compelling virtualized data center solution and continue our progress in the campus.","Customer feedback around our solutions and especially recent innovations has been very positive. Many of our new products are in active customer engagements across all geographies resulting in trial, design wins and live deployment. The innovations we are bringing to market are designed in collaboration with our customers and in response to their needs. And as with any new architecture, implementation is a multistage process. Again, we are pleased with the progress that we are seeing and how we're delivering against our innovation agenda.","At this point, I'm going to turn over to Robyn. Thank you very much.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflected our continued focus on disciplined operational execution. We saw broad strength in U.S. Service Provider this quarter. As anticipated, our Enterprise business showed a typical first quarter decline with additional expected weakness in federal. Our improved earnings reflect good revenue performance and cost reduction progress.","Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, book-to-bill was below 1, which is typical in the first quarter. Product backlog and product deferred revenue both increased year-over-year and are at healthy levels. And as a reminder, deferred product revenue can fluctuate based on the recognition and timing of specific project deployment.","Total revenue was $1,059,000,000, down 7% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. Overall, the sequential decline was in line with historical patterns. Sequentially and year-over-year, we saw strong performance in the Americas Service Provider sector. In the first quarter, both AT&T and Verizon each accounted for 10% of Juniper's total revenue, reflecting the momentum that we are seeing with U.S. service providers. These customers continue to be strategic to Juniper, deploying our routing, switching and security products across both the wired and wireless networks.","For the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.18. This includes the $0.05 benefit related to a tax settlement, $0.03 for the renewal of the R&D tax credit and a $0.02 litigation charge, as well as a $0.01 restructuring charge associated with our ongoing productivity and efficiency action.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.24, down $0.04 sequentially and up $0.08 year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in EPS was due to a substantial improvement in operating margin, fueled by a combination of modest revenue growth, stronger gross margins and lower operating expenses.","Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, market and business segments. Americas revenue was down 2% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. We saw continued broad-based strength in the U.S. carriers, cable and content providers, which increased 1% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Enterprise was down year-over-year by 2%, with the majority as the result of U.S. federal decline. Excluding federal, the rest of  Enterprise increased 5% compared to the third quarter of last year.","EMEA revenue was down 14% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily driven by lower Enterprise revenue. On a year-over-year basis, the decline was a result of Eastern Europe. Excluding this region, the rest of EMEA increased. We saw early indications of improving demand among some service providers across the region.","APAC revenue was down 10% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to slower spending by certain large carriers in Japan and Australia, partially offset by gains with regional service providers across the","theater.","","Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $713 million, down 4% sequentially. Revenue was up 4% on a year-over-year basis, by increased U.S. Service Provider demand. Enterprise revenue was $346 million, down 14% sequentially and flat year-over-year, with a 25% decline in U.S. federal versus the first quarter of 2012.","Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems Division revenue was $809 million, down 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Total router product revenue was down 4% sequentially to $514 million. We saw a good sequential increase in core routing and edge routing continues to be strong. Routing increased by 7% year-over-year, and we saw continued momentum from MX and PTX. As I noted last quarter, we will continue to closely manage our supply chain in response to increasing Service Provider edge routing demand.","Total switching product revenue was $132 million, down 10% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. The sequential change reflects good content Service Provider growth offset by a seasonal Enterprise decline. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to growth in the QFabric product family.","SSD revenue in the first quarter was $250 million, down 9% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $137 million, down 19% both sequentially and year-over-year. Of the $32 million year-over-year decline, $20 million was due to fluctuations in the timing of service provider deployment. Enterprise security decreased $12 million as the ScreenOS product declined more rapidly than the growth of SRX. We remain focused on stabilizing our Enterprise security share in 2013.","We continue to see positive momentum with our new products and are on track toward achieving our goal of $150 million in revenues from new products in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, revenue from these products were over $85 million. In order of magnitude, P4000, PTX and QFabric provided the bulk of the revenue. Also, we are seeing good customer interest in our ACX Universal backhaul products.","Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 64.6% compared to 65.3% last quarter, reflecting the lower volume. The 2-percentage-point improvement year-over-year demonstrates the progress we've made on supply chain cost reduction, as well as greater efficiency in our delivery of services and customer support. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 65.5% and non-GAAP services gross margins were 62.1%. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased $19 million or 4% sequentially and 1% year-over-year to $518 million. The OpEx declined as a result of the progress we've made in aligning our cost structure to our focused priority.","Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,322 employees, a sequential increase of 88 as we continue to balance our geographic personnel mix to optimize our cost structure. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 15.7%. This reflects a substantial year-over-year improvement in financial metrics, including a 3% growth in revenue, a 2% expansion of our total gross margin and a 1% decrease in operating expenses. I'm pleased with our progress this quarter towards our long-term financial model.","Turning to an explanation of our taxes this quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 19.8%, down 7 points versus the prior quarter due primarily to the $15 million one-time benefit of the 2012 R&D tax credit and the current effects of the 2013 R&D tax credit. The GAAP tax rate was a negative 18.3% for the quarter, primarily as a result of a tax settlement with the IRS.","Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of net cash and investments. For the quarter, we saw a net cash outflow from operations of $9 million due mainly to a sequential increase in the cash receivables, lower net income, annual payments for incentive compensation and the timing of payments to our supply chain. In Q2, we expect to return to our historical pattern of strong positive cash flow.","DSO was at the high end of our historical range at 45 days in the quarter, up from 35 days last quarter due primarily to shipment linearity. Capital expenditures were $72 million, down 22% from the fourth quarter as we near the completion of our Sunnyvale campus. We repurchased 6.2 million shares for $130 million. We have $438 million remaining on our current authorization and expect to calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions.","Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Our outlook for the June quarter reflects our expectation of continued weakness in the Enterprise customer spending environment. In Service Provider, we expect to see a continuation of U.S. Service Provider capital spending and some modest improvement in demand emerging in EMEA. Our new products continue to build momentum, especially in routing, and we remain focused on disciplined operational execution while driving revenue growth.","For the second quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,070,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 64% to 65%. Operating expenses are expected to be $510 million, plus or minus $5 million, and with this lower operating expense run rate, we remain on track to deliver on our cost reduction goals for the year. At the midpoint of guidance, operating margins are expected to be 17.5%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.22 and $0.26 per share, assuming a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%, which is inclusive of the R&D tax credit.","To summarize, we expect the near-term market conditions to remain uncertain, with modest growth in the markets we serve. Given that environment, we will continue to navigate with a disciplined approach, executing with agility, taking share in routing and switching and capitalizing on the market opportunities at stake. We are focused on driving year-over-year operating margin expansion, generating strong cash flows and prudently allocating capital. And we will maintain our focus on delivering innovation and revenue growth over the long term.","I would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and commitment to successfully executing our strategy. And now, let's open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just had a couple for you. I wanted to talk a little bit -- get you to talk a little bit more about the underlying trends in routing. I mean, Rami, it sounds like things are definitely starting to improve there. I wonder if you could give us any kind of regional commentary in terms of what you're expecting in Europe. And, for instance, do you expect Europe to actually grow significantly this year? Do you think it's just going to be more stable than it was last year? What kind of declines are you seeing there? And also on the T4000, if you could just clarify specifically what trends you're seeing there that give you guys more confidence. I wasn't sure I came away with a real clear picture of what you're saying about the T4000. And then also on routing, if you could talk a little bit about PTX trials. Can you give us any idea how many people are actually trialing the product right now and what the pipeline there looks like? And then the last thing is the EX9200 is not a QFabric switch. And I just wondered, Kevin, if maybe you could talk about the strategy in switching. Are you guys hedging your bets a little bit? Do you have now a two-pronged approach, one that's QFabric-oriented but also one that's going to be more on QFabric, SDN switching oriented?","Kathleen Nemeth","Rod, it's Kathleen. Do want to prioritize the top 2 of those?","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Why don't you talk about T4000 ramp and what's going on there, and then the switching strategy would be great.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay, fantastic.","Kevin R. Johnson","Okay, let me -- so let me start. First of all, maybe just a couple of comments on some of the segments and how we characterize our routing business. I'd say that we were pleased with the balanced approach and the -- actually the success that we saw from the standpoint of the very segments that brought our routing products. So we saw good growth in cable operator space with traditional telcos and also in content providers. And each of these very different segments bought for different reasons. Clearly, cable operators are dealing with massive growth of video traffic, so this plays right to our strength from the standpoint of offering high-performance systems. The telcos, a lot of consolidation convergence, again, followed by the Universal Edge. The supercore product plays to that sort of trend that's happening in the industry. And last thing on the content providers, also known as Web 2.0, it's about peering and data centers and data center interconnect, again, all sort of trends that benefit from the high performance that we offer in many of our products and solutions. On the T4000, certainly what we saw, as Robyn mentioned, is that we saw sequential strength in our core overall. I will say that part of that strength came from the T4000 itself in the Q1 timeframe. I will say that still today, operators are more focused on the drivers in the edge of the network. So there is a greater demand, if you will, for keeping up with the capacity, the services and the connectivity at the edge of the network today. But sequentially, we're pleased with the trends that we saw in the core. You asked about the multichassis. We did announce and started to offer new multichassis products for the T4000. This is part of the natural evolution of the T series. We offered a multichassis solution for the T640, we did it again for the T1600, and now we're doing it for the T4000. It's not the global sort of customer base for the T series that are interested in this product, but clearly, this is a massively scalable solution that's very appealing to our largest customers that we're engaged with a number of Tier 1 operators around the world for that solution. The last thing I'll just mention on the switching side, there is no change in strategy here. In fact, we've always embarked on a two-pronged strategy for our switching solutions, both in the data center and in the campus. And the data center in particular, we know that there are -- is a subset of customers that want to go down a tiered approach so we have a 2-tier solution that consists of the EX product line. We've just strengthened the EX product line with the introduction of the EX9200, which preserves that architectural message of a 2-tier solution but brings in a level of programmability that I think is really going to help us, especially in this day and age where protocols are evolving, SDN is coming into play and our customers are trying to figure what that means for them from a solution standpoint. The other dimension to our strategy remains very consistent, which is that of the QFabric, a single-tier architecture. The QFabric, as you know, is our flagship data center product. And we did see again a bit more momentum there because of the fact that we introduced the MicroFabric, as well as some additional features that have been waiting -- that some of our customers have been waiting for.","Operator","The next question is from Kevin Dennean of Citi.","Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, Robyn, quick one for you. Previously, you discussed about $150 million in cost savings split between cost of sales and OpEx. How should we think about the pace of those cost reductions through the year? You're guiding, I think, at the midpoint $510 million for the next quarter, which is a modest reduction year-over-year. But if you could talk a little bit about the trajectory and what we should expect in second half OpEx.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, so in terms of the cost targets that we put out there, $150 million between COGS and OpEx, and about 75%, 80% in the OpEx area. We are making very good progress against that. You saw the sequential decline from Q4 to Q1, where typically we see an increase in the Q1 spending given the factors that influence Q1 around salaries and that type of thing. So we've actually -- we believe we've made good progress in terms of the cost reductions. As I mentioned on the Q4 earning call, many of the reduction in force or the workforce sort of reductions have actually happened in terms of the Q4 timeframe. We are continuing to work on supply chain reductions, as well as the overall infrastructure in the company, facilities and that type of thing, and that will be ongoing throughout Q2 and Q3 especially. So my view is we're on track to meet the targets that we set out, and I'm pleased with the progress that we've made.","Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So, Kathleen, just following up on that, should we expect the bulk of the remaining cost savings, particularly in OpEx, to be concentrated in the fourth quarter? Or do you expect it to be somewhat even between the third and fourth quarters?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, I would -- at this point, I think that we'll see it evenly between third and fourth quarter in terms of the reduction.","Operator","The next question is from Mark McKechnie of Evercore Partners.","Mark McKechnie - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So my question is about the new products. So they were about $85 million this quarter towards your goal of $150 million. Maybe, Robyn, could you give us a sense for the margin profile of these new products relative to your corporate margins here?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, thanks, Mark. In terms of the new products, we're making good progress against the goal that we set for Q4 of 2013 of achieving a quarterly run rate of $150 million. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that's largely coming from the routing products and QFabric. So that's actually the bulk of the over $85 million in the first quarter that we saw. In terms of margin profile, if you go back to my SAM presentation, we actually put what was at or above the corporate average in terms of product gross margins. And clearly, the routing products are above the corporate average. ACX, the access product, which is in the 5 products in terms of the new product target, not a material revenue at this point but is in that number, they were below the corporate average. And switching and -- is sort of in the middle of that. So our view is we're well on track for the 150 for the fourth quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Kevin, I was wondering if you could shed some more light on your expectations for Asia Pac. It looks like that region continues to struggle. And then I had a follow-up for Robyn. Just in terms of your buyback capacity, if you could just remind us what's left in the program?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, Amitabh, thanks for the question. On Asia Pacific, when you look at the Service Provider business in Asia Pacific, you almost have to look at it country by country. It's not necessarily a homogenous region. So as Robyn commented, we'd saw some slowdowns in Japan and Australia. I think India, given the way that spectrum has been allocated and some of the unique challenges those service providers face, I think that's a unique market and yet it's one that I think has opportunity but not one on the Service Provider side that we've seen significant uptick in. We continue to compete well in certain opportunities in China and some of the partnership work that we've done there. So it really does vary on the Service Provider side. And then I think on the enterprise side, globally, certainly our largest verticals that we focus on in the Enterprise side would be financial services and federal, specifically U.S. federal. But I think relative to some of the work that we see or happening in the Enterprise side, I think Asia Pacific has had their share of challenges as well. But overall, I think you'd kind of have to look at it country by country. And it's mixed, and I think there's certain countries that I think we see opportunity or doing well and others that have been a little bit of a slowdown. Robyn?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, in terms of the buyback, in -- we have $438 million remaining on the current authorization of the buyback.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.","Stephen Patel - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is Stephen Patel for Brian. You've mentioned Service Provider starting to sound a little better, especially in the U.S. and even a little bit in EMEA as well. Can you talk more about what those customers are telling you and what kind of visibility you have on their plans for the rest of the year?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, I'll kick off the answer, Stephen, and then I'll let Rami add to it. Yes, I think we -- 2 quarters ago, I think started indicating that we saw some positive trends in terms of an uptick in North America Service Provider demand, and that was really driven by visibility to specific projects that we're involved in and that were unfolding. And now, we're starting to see those projects come to fruition and into implementation. I think this is a quarter, last couple of quarters, where we also now started to see a few of those types of projects start to emerge in Europe, with service providers in Europe. In addition, in the U.S., we saw specific strength in the content Service Providers, the Web 2.0 types of companies, as well as cable. And so that's a positive indicator. So, much of what we look for is, when we win a specific project, there's a certain amount of planning and configuration and architecture work that goes into it, and then you start into the deployment phases. And so when we just look at the portfolio of projects that are in progress that we've won and we're in progress and looked at sort of how the capital expenditures will then follow as they're aligned with those projects, we feel like we've got some positive trends in the U.S. and some good signals for some positive trends beginning to emerge in Europe. And, Rami, I'll let you comment further.","Rami Rahim","Yes, I think Kevin covered most of it. I'll just add a couple of things. In our discussions with customers around the world, it's clear that traffic is continuing to grow. And this forms, of course, the foundation of much of our business. So it just comes down now to how much of a risk operators want to take or how hot they want to run their network before they want to invest. Clearly, as long as that traffic continues to increase, which we see it increasing everywhere, that investment cycle, especially in cost centers like the core, will come eventually. It's just a matter of trying to predict when, and it's very difficult to do so. The other element of the discussion is around service generation, which is all around things like the Universal Edge, our SDN strategy, our service chaining approach and so forth. This discussion and these engagements are really happening everywhere. But as Kevin mentioned, the pickup that we're seeing, the early signs we're seeing, are most -- are mostly prominent in the U.S. and certain parts of EMEA.","Operator","The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think you just reported about 20% mix to the CapEx plan for the quarter. And on the other hand, you have strength with AT&T, specifically, you mentioned 10% customer. Can you discuss the nature of Service Provider revenues in this quarter? Are these related to specific projects that there is concentration in 1 or 2 projects or is it more broad-based? It's just that your commentary specifically is so different than what they said on CapEx, so I'm trying to understand the disconnect.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, Tal, this is Kevin. Thanks for the question. I'm going to stay away from commenting on specifics about any one individual customer, but I think that the broad answer is that clearly in our relationships with customers, we work to diversify not only the set of projects that we're working on but the depth of work that we're doing in each of those projects. And I think in some customer situations, it's new design wins, it's adding new projects, and in other customer situations, it's a balance of several projects. I think generally in the U.S. what we're seeing is a wider range of projects that we're getting involved in, and that's strategically what we've been driving to do with the Universal Edge. And I'll let Rami comment more. But the Universal Edge and the MX product family has really become a real workhorse for us and for our customers. And the fact that we're seeing the convergence of -- if it's just the consumer plus the business services and in a BNG type of implementation, that's creating opportunity for our customers to consolidate networks and get the economic benefits of doing that and leverage their investment in the MX to do that. So that's an example of one of the drivers that we've seen consistently around the world and customers in all 3 theaters. But I think the general answer is that in the U.S., it's probably a range of projects that we're involved in and certainly in a range of customers. And I think as we commented in Europe, what we're seeing now is the size of new projects being kicked off and launched in Europe, which is a signal that they're now starting to ramp with some new work. And, Rami, why don't I let you comment further on your perspective.","Rami Rahim","Yes, sure. I'll just  say that it's not unusual, especially with our largest customers that we're engaging on a number of projects simultaneously. And as Kevin mentioned, even with a single platform like the MX, you can be participating in projects to solve various different challenges that our customers have with that platform being used in different applications. So that continues to happen. Increasingly, for example, we're not just having a conversation about wireline, but we're also talking about wireless projects and sort of solutions that our customers demand as they move their network from 2G, 3G to 4G. We mentioned, for example, in the last part of 2012, we introduced ACX. This is all about at bookend to solutions that takes many of our existing products and pushes them into the wireless side of the sort of the solutions base for our customers, we're having a lot of those discussions and they're happening in parallel to many other sort of discussions as well with a variety of different products.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, and Tal, just a final point on the comments that Rami and I made, we talked a lot about the Edge and what's happening on access. But in many of these cases, we're also doing work in the core. I mean, we saw a good uptake of PTX, as well as sequential increase in T series. So I mean that just sort of supports the fact, I think, and certainly in our North American service providers, it's a range of projects, it's a variety of projects, that's contributing.","Operator","The next question is from George Notter of Jefferies.","George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask first for more commentary on your federal business. Obviously, it was weak this quarter. But I guess I'm trying to understand exactly what's driving that. Certainly, I would imagine the sequester is a big piece of the story here. But are you seeing smaller deal sizes? Are you seeing deal pushouts? Is the business just being canceled? I mean, any kind of flavor you could give us there would be great. And then also, I'd love to understand what you got baked into expectations for the federal business for Q2.","Kevin R. Johnson","I'll take the first part of your question, George, and I'll let Robyn comment on the Q2 guide. I think the answers in federal is all of the above. When they're trying to find ways to conserve capital and reduce investment or reduce cost, they're going to look every place they can. That's not to say there haven't been some orders and some projects that we've been engaged in, but in that, I think, is there's some areas that spending has been curtailed, others where projects have been cut back and yet some areas where projects are still going forward. And so the -- our federal team has worked very hard to navigate sort of the challenges that we know our federal customers is trying to deal with to make sure that we're focused in the right area. And I think Robyn commented on the decline that we saw year-on-year in our federal revenue. Do you want to comment on the guidance, Robyn?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. So, George, in terms of the second quarter, what I did say in terms of the guidance is we expect the same sort of trends in the second quarter. So we're expecting Enterprise to be soft in the second quarter given the ongoing challenges in the budget environment with Federal.","Operator","The next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Morgan Stanley.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, Rami, if you can just touch on some of the claims that Alcatel-Lucent has been making with the new 7950 they claim and going aggressive out there and taking share specifically from you guys. So can you just give a brief overview of what you are or not seeing from ALU in the market on routing? Then on security, it was down 20% last quarter. I think you said that branch SRX orders were up 17% and high-end SRX is off 19%. I didn't hear similar quarters -- at revenue, actually you spoke to those, I didn't hear similar numbers this quarter. So Robyn, if you can give some just color around what the 2 different types of SRX did in terms of revenue this quarter to get  to the down 20%, give us some color there, and what you're expecting in guidance, that will be helpful. On switching, I was surprised it's down as much as it was down 10%, 11%, and orders, you said last quarter, were up 19% in switching. So I just want to make sure I'm comparing apples-to-apples, and it would be good to understand why the orders didn't necessarily translate into higher switching revenue, and how QFabric plays into that, because Kevin had sounded like QFabric got stronger again. Can you give us color on QFabric and then with customers and how that played into that? It's a lot of questions.","Kevin R. Johnson","Okay, let's -- Rami, I'll let you take the first one on ALU.","Rami Rahim","Okay. Yes, certainly. So what I'd say this is that first, I don't underestimate any of our competitors. So a lot of respect for all of our competitors. But that said, building the massively scalable ultra-large core systems that our customers demand is not an easy thing to do, and this is part of Juniper's strength and our DNA. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I think that we have a three-pronged innovation strategy that, quite frankly, whether you talk about Alcatel or any other competitor, it's going to be difficult for them to match. Everything from the investment protection story that we offer with the T Series to the PTX, which is really a new breed of core transport supercore router that really nobody else has from the standpoint of efficiency, power efficiency, transport capability, optical integration. We just strengthened that with the announcement of the PTX3000. And last but not least, is the MX2020, which, again, we've just introduced along with denser line cards for the customer that wants to do more of a service-rich core. So the combination of these 3 products gives me confidence that I think we're going to do very well against incumbent competitors, as well as newer competitors that are trying to get into this space.","Kevin R. Johnson","Okay. Then on the question on security, maybe Robyn, why don't you start with the numbers and then I'll let Bob comment on sort of the focus that we have on the security business.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, so in terms of the security business, I talked about year-over-year that there was a $32 million decline year-over-year and $20 million of it was in the SP space. And that SP space is high-end SRX. On the Enterprise side, SRX did increase year-over-year. But the NetScreen OS products are declining at a faster rate than the rate of increase in SRX. And as you know, Ehud, that's what we've been focused on, if you like, turning the business around. And so Bob, do you want to comment on the Enterprise security?","Robert L. Muglia","Sure. Let me make a comment on both sectors, if I would. On the Service Provider, as you mentioned, we always see this revenue to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. And right now, we're also in the middle of a product transition as we're bringing out a next generation of service play that increases our per session capacity to 100 million sessions and provides our Service Provider customers with the continued leading performance that they've come to expect out of the SRX. So that's one of the factors that we expect has had some implication of Service Provider space, although the deals just come in at different quarters and that has been true for some time. In the Enterprise -- in the data center space, which really is for both the Service Provider and the Enterprise, we have seen some increased interest certainly from our customers, and we have some confidence that this will lead to long-term strength in the business as we've introduced new products in this space, such as WebApp Secure and our recent introduction of Spotlight, which fingerprints hackers using technology that is unavailable from anyone else in the industry. And we've got some very, very strong positive conversations with leading CSOs of major Enterprise and Service Provider customers over the past quarter in this space. And we see the data center as an area where we are once again return to a very competitive position, and in fact, have some leading-edge technology. The other area where we have been -- have had more challenge, and this is consistent with the conversations we've been having for a year, is in the campus and branch space, which is really in the Enterprise. And there are still some areas of product deficiency that we're working to correct. We have introduced and have had -- and I've talked about in previous quarters, Security Director in the marketplace. We're seeing good acceptance of Security Director with customers such as Revlon, Ecopetrol in Colombia, a major Colombian oil and gas company, as well as Meyer, a Midwestern retailer, are 3 examples of reference customers who have successfully adopted Security Director and then using it to manage their systems. We have new buildings we need to do in that space still, particularly in the reporting area. But we are continuing to focus on all 3 areas of security and have a long-term confidence in the business.","Kevin R. Johnson","So then that third question, Ehud, was in the area of switching. And overall, the switching business grew 6% year-on-year, and certainly that even accounted for the declines that we saw in federal and other parts of Enterprise. And I think much of that was driven by -- part of that was driven by QFabric that continues to grow. And QFabric, a little color behind that, I think we -- that product is really oriented in many ways to large data center types of feeds. We saw, in this particular quarter, deployment of one of our large customers in a large data center that contributed to that. And in terms of the bridge between the orders in Q4, and do you want, Robyn, to make a comment?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. So -- and so in Q4, Ehud, we actually said that it was Service Provider demand that was in backlog if you like, and we did see that coming through in the results this quarter. We talked about switching being up in the Service Provider space in the quarter, even though we did see declines in the Enterprise space in the quarter.","Operator","The last question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan of The Juda Group.","Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division","My question was to follow up on security. I wanted to see if you could talk about if you feel like you're reaching a bottom in security, given the new product transitions you're seeing, as well as some of the new capabilities in the campus data center or if you expect to see that at some point, just given the quarterly revenue run rate, is that a kind of a multi-year low for the quarterly revenues?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, so let me sort of kick off and just reiterate a way that I think it's important for you to think about this, and then I'll let Bob comment. What Bob talked about is 3 different areas of our security business. The first one being Service Provider, and we feel we're in a very good position with Service Providers. The revenue is lumpy. This is a quarter that it was low, but we feel like with the R&D we've done and the ability to take the SRX to handle 100 million concurrent sessions, that value proposition for Service Providers as they're securing LTE traffic in the mobile Internet is and continues to be a strong value proposition. So that part of our security business, we feel very good about. Yes, revenue is lumpy, but we've got new design wins. Our largest customers are continuing to deploy. We've got new innovation that addresses their need of scale. Service Provider is in good shape in securing mobile Internet. The second bucket is data center, and I think -- as Bob highlighted, I think the new innovation that we delivered at data center combined with our SRX and SSL VPN technology, we feel good about our data center offerings. We've got good customer interest. We've got to work, make sure we'd convert that to revenue, so I think data center, we feel good about. And the area that we know we still have work to do is in that campus and branch area. So you net that out, I think -- and Robyn's comments that of the year-on-year decrease in security, $20 million of that roughly was Service Provider, and that's lumpy and we're confident that we've got the right set of solutions there. So it was $10 million that was related to Enterprise. And we think that we're -- we've got a good value proposition at data center and we've still got work to do in campus. So that's kind of the framework to think about it. So the question is we've shifted the bulk of our revenue now to the SRX, and so the older ScreenOS products will continue to decline and it's our ability to then offset that with faster growth on the SRX, and we feel stronger in Service Provider and data center than in campus and branch. I think that's kind of the net of what Bob outlined.","Robert L. Muglia","Right. That exactly right, Kevin. I think that we're in the products transition cycle and multi-quarter products transition cycle from the ScreenOS generation of products to the SRX. The SRX brings us strength in Service Provider, which we've never had before, and that is an area where, particularly as service providers do LTE buildouts, we see the ability to profit from that. Meanwhile, we need to ensure that we double down in the Enterprise segment. We feel like we've made good progress in the data center space with what we've introduced. We still have work to do in campus and branch, which is a large part of the Enterprise market, but that's an area of continued focus on the team. And this is a multi-quarter transition.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay. Thank you very much. That is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank you again.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. An interactive question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth. Thank you. You may begin.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial results, capital return program and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause the actual results to materially differ are listed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time to time.","All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update information presented on this call if facts or circumstances change after the date of the call.","Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today.","Please keep your questions to one per firm.","With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Kathleen. Good afternoon, everyone.","The results we announced today were not the results we set out to achieve for the second half of this year, so let me address that first and foremost. Juniper has always excelled at building the largest, most demanding network in the world. This is both the result of our deliberate strategy and a reflection of where our strength lies.","Over the last several years, some of the most mission-critical networks in the world have been built by Cloud providers. I'm very proud of how we have successfully pivoted our strategy to capture that tremendous opportunity and execute it against our innovation road map to grow our relevance and our business in the Cloud vertical. At the same time, having such large and agile customers can lead to significant lumpiness in our business, which we saw in Q3 and expect to continue into Q4.","Let me provide some insight on our current work with these large Cloud providers. First, as you know, we have built substantial footprint with these companies over the past few years. This has been the result of our innovative products and also our close surround and support of these customers as they've grown. As their growth continues, it is clear that their architectures need to evolve, and we are leading the charge to more modern, cost-efficient, scalable networks.","In Q3 and Q4, we are seeing a spending delay as our largest customers prepare to go through this architectural shift. This is not uncommon in our industry, and Juniper has benefited before in leading architectural shift such as with the Converged Supercore and data center fabrics.","What's most important is that we are maintaining our strong footprint as these shifts unfold. We continue to challenge the status quo, and that approach is only making us more relevant with our most important customers, even if it sometimes has a short-term disruptive impact.","While we're disappointed with our revenue and earnings performance in Q3, we're confident that we've made significant progress in establishing a strong footprint developing the right products and executing on an innovative product pipeline.","Now I'd like to summarize the performance across Switching, Routing and Security. In Switching, we're disappointed with our overall revenue decline in Q3. Normalized for lumpiness from our large hyper-scale customers due to the spending delay I mentioned, our QFX product line continued to grow at double-digit rates, both sequentially and year-over-year. It continues to grow across public and private Cloud segments driven by 100-gig adoption, our innovation and automation in telemetry, our leadership in network protocols like EVPN, as well as our Fusion fabric solution that simplifies data center operation. We remain confident in the competitiveness of our QFX product line across all verticals, including Cloud and hyper-scalers.","In Routing, our business grew sequentially and declined year-over-year in a dynamic environment. Our PTX product line continued to gain traction, and in fact, achieved a record revenue quarter in Q3 as our customers have embraced its unique attributes for core build-out. The success of the PTX product line is evident in the most recent IHS Markit share report that for the first time ever showed Juniper in first place position in North America core Routing market share over the last 12 months. Additionally, we saw Routing growth in APAC, both sequentially and year over year.","In Security, our business grew sequentially driven by momentum in the data center, service provider and next-gen firewall sales. We believe more customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection and enforcement against cyber threats. Our Software-Defined Secure Network solution is gaining traction, and we've added many new customers in Q3 that are leveraging its benefits.","During the quarter, we also closed the acquisition of Cyphort, a leader in automated malware analysis and detection. In the quarter, we continued to see momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins, including Strategic Enterprise customers in APAC and a Canadian service provider, as well as recurring revenues from renewal of existing annual subscription.","We also unveiled Contrail Security, an important addition to Juniper's Security portfolio. We believe we are executing on an extremely compelling product road map for Contrail that should result in an expansion of its used cases across a broader set of customers.","Additionally, AppFormix's customer base has steadily expanded across SaaS, enterprises, and telecom operators. AppFormix and Contrail have been integrated for seamless operations management and advanced analytics of Juniper's hardware and software products in several customer use cases.","In Services, we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services resulting in year-over-year growth.","We remain committed to all of our strategic verticals, especially the Cloud and believe that we are more relevant than ever to our customers and the industry. We are innovating in ways that truly matter to all network builders and operators that are embracing Cloud architectures to drive greater levels of operating efficiency and service agility.","I'm also delighted to have on board our new CTO, Bikash Koley, who has firsthand knowledge and experience in building and operating large-scale Cloud networks and is now helping us further refine our strategy and sharpen our execution across our entire innovation pipeline. I'm very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us.","In summary, while we're not satisfied with our second half expected performance, we are confident that we have the right strategy and the right products and solutions portfolio. I'd like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders.","I will now turn over the call to Ken, who will discuss quarterly financial results in more detail.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone.","The financial results for the September quarter were disappointing, with revenue and non-GAAP EPS falling below our expectations. The lower than expected revenue result was primarily due to the timing of certain large switching deployments within the Cloud vertical related to architectural shifts.","Total revenue for the third quarter was $1.258 billion, down 4% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. Our technologies posted mixed results for the quarter. Routing grew sequentially, but declined year-over-year due to Telecom and Cable deployments.","Switching declined both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to the delay of certain large Cloud customer deployments. And Security grew sequentially for the second consecutive quarter.","Service revenue continued to be solid, growing 9% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were Cloud, four were Telecom or Cable, and one was a Strategic Enterprise. Of these customers, one was located outside of the United States.","Product deferred revenue was $324 million, up $26 million or 9% year-over-year and sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP operating expenses declined 2% year-over-year and sequentially and were 38.5% of revenue. This reflects our continued focus on managing expenses through increased efficiencies and a focus on operational excellence.","Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.55, down $0.02 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the lower revenue, partially offset by lower operating and other expenses. Cash flow from operations were $202 million for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to slightly more than $1 billion.","We continued to return capital to shareholders. And during the third quarter, we repurchased $140 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends.","Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our website. As we have discussed in the past, elements of our addressable market are dynamic; and particularly within the Cloud vertical, change can occur rapidly.","Our Q4 revenue outlook reflects continued large deployment delays. As we expect, our largest Cloud customers will continue their architectural transition. Despite this outlook, we remain confident in our competitive position and strong relationships with these strategic customers.","Gross margins are expected to remain at current levels.","We expect to continue managing operating expenses prudently and to drive increased operational efficiencies.","Today, we initiated a realignment of our workforce as we continue to prioritize our investments in the most critical areas of our business. We are committed to returning approximately 50% of our free cash flow and expect to be opportunistic with our share repurchases.","Despite the disappointing full year outlook, we are confident in our strategy and remain committed to our long-term financial principles of driving revenue growth, earnings expansion, and an optimized capital structure.","In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper.","Now I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Brian White from Drexel. Please go ahead.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah, Rami, how do we know this is an architectural shift here at customers rather than increased competition, number one? And if this is some type of delay, do you expect to get this revenue back in 2018? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. Well, how you know, I mean, what I'm seeing through the discussions, the engagements that I'm having through our customers, I'll tell you that \u2013 especially our Cloud customers is all around a transition that's happening in switching from 10 and 40-gig to 100-gig. And in wide area networking from what has traditionally been scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures or something that we have called lean core architectures. We're very close to our customer base, especially our Cloud customer base.","We've developed many of the products that are in the market today, in particular, the PTX product line with a keen understanding of what \u2013 how these architectural evolutions are going to happen. And honestly, I think the competitiveness of that product is very strong, as you've seen from the results in Q3 with a record revenue quarter for the PTX.","I also mentioned in my prepared remarks the fact that we've gained now number one market share in core Routing in North America, and that's primarily because it's been helped by the Cloud provider customers.","So I firmly believe that this is a transition where we will emerge on the other side of it. We, in fact, have been leading the charge with the transition. And I think from a competitive standpoint, there's no doubt this is a competitive industry. But because of the products we have and the tight relationships we have with this customer base, I'm very confident.","As far as timing, I think that the Switching transition, especially with hyper-scalers, is one that will play out through the rest of this year. And the first part of next year, we should start to see a resumption of more normal spending patterns, especially for the new 100-gig base switching architectures.","In Routing, I think it's going to be a bit of a multi-quarter type of transition that's going to happen towards the PTX, towards scale-out architectures. And I think that's all up for next year, Routing is probably going to be a flattish type of business for us. I think that, considering the dynamics that are happening in the market would be a pretty decent result.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my question. I want to see if, first of all, you could clarify whether or not the customer that slowed down is the same customer that was a 10% customer in the June quarter, and if this could simply be an issue where there was too much inventory built up in June and it takes some time to absorb it. Is that a possible scenario for what's played out here?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So we believe that it's a positive for the transition as Rami mentioned. From a customer perspective, I mean, we are pretty heavily engaged with the Telco vertical as well as the Cloud vertical. And there is a pretty high level of concentration in both of those verticals. For us to have these types of results, I think it's pretty evident that it's going to be one of our larger customers and a pretty large deployment that was impacted, and I'll leave it at that.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just in terms of the trending, your Cloud, if I did the math correctly, was still 27% of overall sales, so it's still significant. If we want to look past the lumpiness and just think about how you see your business evolving, let's say, over roughly a two-year window, where do you see these vertical mixes coming in terms of maybe \u2013 roughly a two-year outlook? Would you expect that that Cloud vertical turns into a third of revenue, 35% to 40%? What's realistic for how you expect your mix evolve? Thank you.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So the Cloud vertical has been clearly our growth vertical for the last couple of years, and it's very evident that we believe we're on the right side of change as it relates to that vertical, and we've seen the strong results because of that. Through this transition period, I think we're going to see a little bit of lumpiness as we transition.","But as we come out the other side, as Rami mentioned, it's important to note that we believe we are on both sides of this transition. So the pause in the middle is really the most troubling part from a financial perspective. As they start to ramp up with the new architectures, we believe we will be able to grow in the Cloud vertical going forward.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Let me just double-click a little bit on that, and I'll do it from the standpoint of Routing and Switching. In Routing, we've always enjoyed pretty substantial market share in the Cloud vertical. And I fully expect based on the competitiveness of our products, based on the full understanding that the transitions that are happening right now are going towards architectures that we are enabling ourselves. So to the extent that our \u2013 the Cloud customers themselves are successful and continues to see traffic growth in their wide area network, I think we'll benefit from that.","On the Switching side, where we have seen really good traction in Switching has been in Tier 2, Tier 3 Cloud providers. This has been a deliberate part of our strategy. We knew that this would be sort of the lower hanging fruit for us as we introduce the full extent of our Switching portfolio into the marketplace.","And then Tier 1 Cloud providers, we do have some meaningful deployments there, but it largely remains an opportunity for us. This is where I believe the opportunity for us over the next couple of years is really going to be strong.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Just two if I could. First, just, Ken, if you could talk a little bit about the gross margins in the quarter. I think you said it was as expected, but my sense is that might have been before the shortfall. We had Switching weakness and Cloud weakness. So why was it only flat?","And then secondly, a lot of talk about the Cloud vertical weakness, it looks like the Strategic Enterprise was down pretty meaningful as well. Is that the Cloud portion of the Strategic Enterprise, or maybe if you could just talk to us a little bit about what's going on in the Enterprise business, which also seemed pretty weak?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So from a gross margin perspective, I did mention that we came in in line with our expectations at 62%. And you're right, from a mix perspective that provided us a bit of an advantage because we did see some softness in Switching, which is our lower margin product, but that was offset by the volume. The revenue being down traditionally has an impact to gross margin in a negative way, so we effectively offset the lower revenue volume with a better product mix.","From a customer perspective, as we've mentioned in the past, we don't see a significant impact to margin based on vertical. But the more important impact is customer mix within vertical or customer mix overall. So again, to summarize, this quarter was in line. However, we got there a little differently. It was lower revenue, which hurts margin, but higher product mix, because Switching was the revenue miss.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","And on the Enterprise side, so we saw some sequential declines but year-over-year slight increase. I think if you break it apart in the broad enterprise market was where the weakness was from a sequential standpoint, but for Strategic Enterprises, for example, banking would be in that sector or government, we actually saw a bit of a recovery.","I think the catalyst for Enterprise going forward is going to be around our ability to leverage new architectural approaches, take for example, SD-WAN deployment. The strength that we have and the relationships we have with our Telco customers to reach our broader Enterprise, we have a few wins now that we have established this year that I'm hopeful will start to contribute to Enterprise revenue throughout next year.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Please go ahead. I'm sorry, Mark, your line is live. Might be on mute by accident.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Let's go to the next question, and then we'll come back to Mark.","Operator","Okay. We'll go to next question. It's from Pierre Ferragu from AllianceBernstein. Please go ahead.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you for taking my question. Rami, thanks a lot for your clarification around this architectural shift at your large Cloud clients. I had a further question with \u2013 on that \u2013 between Switching and Routing, do you see some kind of changes in architecture as well where in places at the higher level of aggregation, for instance, where we had a lot of Routing or in data center interconnect, do you see a shift of that market toward Switching as well? And is that part of the architectural discussions and debate and changes that are happening at your clients?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes, Pierre. So it's a great question, in fact. And yes, there is a shift that is happening. It's one that we have predicted and developed products and solutions around.","And really, I have been talking about this blurring of the lines that is happening between Routing and Switching. If you look at what's happening to data centers, Cloud data centers in particular, they're getting more distributed. And the interconnect between them is essentially becoming an extension of the fabric that's in the data center. So, we actually saw this happening and understood that there is an opportunity for us to go and capture with a product like the PTX. The PTX, as you think about it is sort of this perfect cocktail of Routing capability from a control plane standpoint, but Switching capability from a data plane and cost efficiency of IP transport. And that has now been adopted by the Cloud providers, and I think will continue to be adopted by the Cloud providers at a pace that quite honestly exceeded our expectation.","And this at least partly explains what we're seeing in terms of the Q4 guidance that we're providing. It's that transition from what I described as scale-up to more of a scale-out approach, which speaks to this blurring of switching and routing across Cloud architectures.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. And then maybe a very quick follow-up. So what we definitely learned these days is that your Cloud segment is made of very large clients, and it's a lumpy business like your Telecom service provider business.","Now if I take a step back, your Telecom and Cable business is down 4% this quarter. Does that mean that growth \u2013 we should expect growth to come mostly from your Cloud division, and we need to see growth coming back from there, or do you still see growth trend and like the business coming back at some point, so many, many quarter of weak business in the Telecom segment as well?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Well, I do think that there is a good opportunity to see growth in Cloud all up as we emerged to the other end of this transitions that we are talking about. Telco remains a challenged market environment, right, where we're seeing more of the same in terms of them running their networks hotter, Cloud transformations that are happening in their own networks, consolidation, M&A are all headwinds that we're facing in the Telco space.","The catalyst, I believe, for Telco spending will be around preparation for 5G, Metro build-outs that I think are going to start to happen over the next couple of years, new approaches to delivering value to the Enterprise that are more virtualized and software nature like SD-WAN. And we've really architected our SD-WAN strategy around enabling the telcos to go after that opportunity.","So for the foreseeable future, we're not counting on any sort of meaningful rebound in Telco, but I think a little bit more longer term, there are going to be some catalysts that I think will help us.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. It's Jim Suva from Citi. You both mentioned Security grew quarter-over-quarter for the second quarter in a row, which is good. But looking back, it looks like that's the normal trend. So my question to you is, are you trying to signal or let us know that you expect this trend to continue quarter-over-quarter, because year-over-year, the results look quite challenged?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Jim. So yes, I do expect that the sequential momentum is going to increase. And there are a few things around the Security business that give me some confidence right now. And we're not out of the woods. We're still working very hard to turn this part of our business around, but there is a sequential performance that we've seen through this year. There is the feedback and the wins that we have from our customers. And we're starting to see some pretty meaningful wins that are building some bookings performance that are encouraging.","There is a diversity of use cases that we're now satisfying. So we've traditionally been strong in the service provider space. The portfolio for the service provider space has quite frankly suffered over the last year or so. It's now coming back to a much more competitive state, but we also are starting to see traction with next-gen firewall and data center.","And then last but not least, I think there is the software attach, the license attached to Security is actually starting to pick up, and that is a pretty good sign. So we remain optimistic around the fact that we can make this sort of the worst year, and we can recover from here going forward.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, just to clarify that, I mean, our definition of success is sustained year-on-year growth. We have not yet achieved that. We're not yet trying to signal that we're happy with sequential growth, and that's all you could expect. We are absolutely turning this business around and expect to get to year-on-year Security growth here in the near future.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sounds great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. I have two questions. The first one is on Switching. I'm trying to understand how much of this is also \u2013 maybe there's an aspect of competitiveness. Did you notice, with the same customer, maybe another vendor gaining share at the same time? Is the challenges you're talking about architecture? Does it cause \u2013 does it drive someone else to gain share in the interim? Or were things put on hold?","Also, does it have anything to do with your product readiness for what the customer is trying to do? Is there anything on your side you need to do to make things work? Or is it simply just the customer?","And the second question I have is, in general, why don't you grow your margins more than where you are? The industry is challenging. Routing is under pressure for many years. Security, you do have some issues, but you're working on it. In times like that of challenges, why don't you work on reducing your expenses to deliver higher margins to investors and maybe compensate for the lower growth rate? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay, so let me start with the question on Switching. There is no doubt that the Switching environment is a very competitive environment. Having said that, where we have footprint, I believe, we're well entrenched. We're very close to our customers. We understand their requirements very well, and there are barriers to entry. And this is in no means trying to project overconfidence because I sort of subscribe to the notion that only the paranoid survive. But I will say that I'm very confident that we're going to maintain our Switching footprint in our large franchises, and we will be on the other side of this transition as they move towards (30:18) architectures.","From a product standpoint, we know what's required. We know what performance levels are needed, the telemetry capabilities that are required, the features that are needed. And I'm bullish about our Switching business all up in the future.","On operating margins, I will let Ken jump in here, but I will say the following. I mean, we have streamlined our organization. We're running far more efficiently than we have in the past. We're enabling a greater level of leveraging of products across different product lines: Routing, and Switching, Routing and Security as an example of that. We're taking out unnecessary costs when we see that there is an opportunity to do so.","So in fact, this is part of the reason why we missed in Q3, but still managed to achieve the low end of our earnings range. And we'll continue to operate in that way. I think this is an important part of delivering shareholder value. Ken?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So we actually are quite pleased with our Q3 OpEx results that came in at the low end of our range, actually below our range. We continue to be laser focused. I think you've seen that in the last few quarters, laser-focused on cost discipline and making sure we look to optimize our structure in our operations.","Today, we initiated a realignment of our workforce, and we're making sure that we're doing that prudently; make sure that we still focus in the right investment areas to drive longer term growth. And you can count on us continuing to focus on earnings, right? We have a stated commitment that we're going to drive earnings faster than revenue.","We're going to grow OpEx lower than revenue. I believe we're going to accomplish the OpEx goal of slower than revenue this year despite the fact that the revenue headwinds hit us harder than we expected, we're still being very prudent with OpEx. And for the full year, we will actually be down in OpEx at the midpoint of our guidance. So I do think we are managing the bottom line quite effectively, and we'll continue to do so going forward.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Meta standing in for James. A couple of questions; first, you mentioned a kind of Switching disruption for the next couple of quarters. Would you expect kind of a Routing disruption on the back of that with certain Cloud customers as they change architecture? Or should we not kind of expect any tail to that beyond Switching?","And then the second question is just if you could give a sense of \u2013 in your Cloud vertical, what is kind of the general split between Tier 1 and maybe the rest of Tier 2, Tier 3? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay. So first, the Routing and Switching transitions that are happening are somewhat related. And it speaks to the color I just provided, I think, to Pierre's question that he asked earlier around sort of the blurring of lines in these architectures. And in Q4, in fact, our guidance that we provided really has sort of a balance of both transitions that are happening, Switching moving to 100-gig, Routing moving to lean core scale-out type architectures, they in some sense do go hand in hand. As far as providing any additional color on Tier 1s and Tier 2 Cloud providers...","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So, we don't break out customer detail other than a couple of facts that you do have out there. One is five of our top 10 customers are Cloud. So that's an important number. And in addition to that, if you were just to look at the Cloud customers' size and breadth in the world, you will see it's very concentrated on the top 5, 7, 10, whatever you want to categorize it.","Our revenues are going to be largely in line with what you would expect, given kind of CapEx spends around the globe. But I don't want to over-rotate on just the hyper-scalers. I mean, obviously, that's where the majority of the spend is, and that's where you could anticipate much of our customer concentration. There is a longer tail in the industry. It's not just about the infrastructure service providers, there's also the SaaS community that we're also very focused on and a broader set of customers around the globe.","Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I'm actually going to focus a bit on the Security side, because you guys mentioned you're investing or buying some kind of security malware functionalities as well. So if I think about your balance sheet now, is that kind of the direction you guys are going to go in, if you go down the M&A front to kind of get differentiated growth outside kind of QFX?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks for the question. So I do think that we've got a healthy balance sheet. And I do view that leveraging that balance sheet in order to buy technology businesses that are very complementary to our strategy very much around Cloud, Cloud Security is an option for us and something that I continue to seriously consider.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then just one small one. When should the 100-gig number start to show up? Is that a 2018 story, or is that going to show up at the back half of Q4?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","No, I \u2013 so a lot of the work to get ready for the transition, the certifications, the architectural work, the qualification work with our customers is happening right now. So I do believe in the first part of next year, we'll start to get to more normal Switching spending patterns with our largest Cloud providers.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal from Instinet. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC","Yes. I would like to delve into the margin structure a bit, if we could. Could you update us on a couple of the other variables on gross margin that we might see some improvement over the next few quarters? And particularly, Ken, you've talked about memory pricing. And then, of course, you've talked a lot about some APAC wins as well.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So the dynamics overall in margin haven't really changed much. I mean, we still see the primary drivers to be kind of customer mix. We've talked about insertion opportunities. In Q3, we had some follow-up from the activity that we talked about in the first half, but we didn't have any new large insertion deals that were actually margin negative in Q3. It was just really completing some of the deals that we entered into in the first half. So there wasn't a big factor in Q3.","The memory pricing is still a headwind. It's an industry phenomenon. It's impacting us, and that's something that's in line with our expectations. As far as when does it come back, I don't see it coming back in Q4. We're not providing guidance on FY 2018, but I would think it's reasonable to assume sometime in 2018, we'll start to see a little bit of relief on the memory price.","And then the product mix is also the dynamic that we experienced a lot. And as Switching continues to be a growth driver for us that will result in a natural kind of headwind to margin.","That being said, we're very focused internally on some value engineering efforts. But we think we have a lot of opportunity within our cost and supply chain to really design our products in a way that really provides the most customer value at the right price point and at the right cost structure.","So I believe we have some of that within our control, and we'll continue to manage margins, despite some natural headwinds with product mix.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC","You talked a little bit about insertion point, and I'm just \u2013 and we hear from others that 100G is indeed an insertion point for their products in existing \u2013 or in new accounts. It seems though you are talking about 100-gig as a pause rather than a potential insertion point. And so I'm a little surprised by the disparity there. I would have thought that that was an opportunity for a customer to start with a new set of vendors.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","So, this is Jeff, I believe, right?","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC","Yes.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","So let me say this. There are certainly accounts \u2013 large Cloud accounts that we're in that where the game we're playing or the approach we're taking is one of making sure that we stay ahead of their requirements with a goal of keeping the competition out. And I think we're doing a really good job at that. We also believe that especially for the Cloud Switching space, we can play and are playing a more offensive strategy to try to insert ourselves.","Now we're not going to always be successful, but thus far, if you look at the performance of our Switching business, and you modulate out the lumpiness due to the large hyper-scaler deployments, we're still seeing double-digit growth in overall Switching. Some of that comes because of our strength in high-performance in 100-gig, in telemetry, in automation, et cetera. So there is a bit of a defensive game you have to play when you're an incumbent. But I also want you to understand, we're playing a very offensive game, especially in Switching, where I think there's still a huge amount of room for us to expand.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thank you. I just want to be absolutely clear regarding your comments about footprint. In none of these large situations where you're seeing a lumpy business, a deferral in business, are you being displaced by competitors or by white box? I just want to confirm that.","And then given this shortfall on product revenue, should we expect to see a deceleration in services growth somewhere down the line or not?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","So let me start. The answer to your first question is yes. It's not a displacement by competition. It is \u2013 if anything, we're displacing ourselves with new architectural approaches, and we're doing this ahead of our customer's requirements to avoid being disrupted or displaced by the competition. And I think in the long term, this approach, playing a challenger type of approach where you \u2013 in some cases need to challenge yourself even if it results in short-term business disruption pays off because it makes us more relevant. And I believe it ultimately helps us to grow our footprint.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, from a services perspective, I mean, we expect it to continue to remain very healthy. We've had a very good run in services the last couple of years. We've done a good job with attach and renewals. And we're also starting to do more in the way of professional services and really the solution sale.","That said, I do think it's reasonable to assume the growth rates that we've been having, which have been largely double digits, 9%, 10% just start to come down a bit. I still think that growth rates will be ahead of the product growth rates, so high single digits, if you will. But it's something that we continue to be strong for us going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, good afternoon. Yeah. I'd like to get your thoughts, Rami, on the pricing dynamics you're seeing out there. And how I mean by this is management teams often do not talk about port pricing ASPs on earnings calls. It would be helpful for us, you do have a legacy routing portfolio. You have the new stuff with 100-gig, a very similar setup in Switching. So help us understand how is pricing trending both on the lower speed legacy side and also on 100-gig both in Routing and in Switching? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. So it's a great question. And obviously, it's a tremendous area of focus for us. For any given platform, take an MX, a PTX, a QFX or just broader routing, switching, et cetera, you're going to see continuous price erosion for a given port speed. This is nothing new. This is something that we're very used to and has been a fact of life that we've had to deal within this industry since the very first product that we introduced into the market.","Now as architecture has evolved and our customers have the ability to move to different architectures that can leverage a different platform, so if you have \u2013 it traditionally builds a scale-up architecture with an MX, and now you're going to go to a scale-out that uses a PTX as an example, there is a price differential between those two platforms that one has to factor. And we are seeing some of that right now for some of the few deployments with our largest Cloud provider to have the ability to transition their architectures in that way.","Ultimately, I do believe that it pays off, because you have to assume that these large Cloud providers are going to continue to see growth in their business, are going to continue to see a lot of demand on their services. And therefore, they're going to need to buy way more ports. That's what we're counting on. That's what I believe is going to happen.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, perfect. A quick follow-on would be, any thoughts on exiting slower or underperforming product areas, such as campus switching, for example? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure. Well, I mean, as far as thoughts of exiting, we are applying a lot of very ruthless analyses to all new products, businesses, technologies where we're going to be investing in, with the goal of making sure that these investments actually do pay off. Campus, I have said this now over the last year or so, even longer than that, I believe, we're going to be focusing on our campus efforts in the large enterprises where we believe that we have some level of differentiation. And also, there is a high degree of leveraging of our development with data center switching, right?","We understand, we don't have a WiFi portfolio. So there's no point in us in going after opportunities where WiFi is tightly integrated with campus. So, yes, we are in campus, but we are really laser-focused on campus opportunities, where we believe that we really have some differentiation. And actually the way I describe this to our teams and our customers is for those enterprises that view their campus as on-ramps to the Cloud where they need high-performance network in order to access Cloud workloads and data sets.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks, Rami.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just some clarification on these Cloud customers over the last couple of quarters which \u2013 Rami, was this a communication issue, or was there sort of a last-minute change and how they viewed architecture over the next big 6- to 12-month deployments internally there? I'm just trying to figure out if we go back to spring timeframe when you were executing this vertical to now, just sort of how that played out with these accounts, as much as you can describe?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Look, it's a great question. And we're obviously disappointed in the fact that we weren't able to predict this. We're very close to our Cloud customers. We engage and talk to them on a very regular basis. We're obviously a very part of their network. What has happened here is an acceleration of plans ahead of what we had expected. So as much as we try very, very hard to predict some of these inflection points, sometimes our own customers' plans can change, which makes it obviously difficult, if not impossible for us to predict these sorts of changes. That's really what it is. I don't think it was a communication problem.","Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Dmitry Netis from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you. A couple of questions for me. On the Cloud vertical, what is the rough split between Switching and Routing? And I know you guys have said Routing probably vast majority, but can you give us a split there?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So what we've said is Routing is still the majority, but it's not the vast majority within the Cloud vertical. In fact, in the first half of this year, you saw Switching get really close to Routing. Routing was still the majority, call that greater than 50%, but it wasn't the vast majority like you would see in Telco, for example. Clearly, these Q3 results, the miss being predominantly Cloud Switching, that mix has gone back to more Routing heavy. But we are expecting over time, the Switching component in Cloud to actually outpace Routing. And eventually, we think that will be the dominant technology within that vertical.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. The next question is on the \u2013 just the impact this quarter. Did this come from just the single customer, or you really saw \u2013 I know \u2013 I get the architectural changes that are happening and how it may impact more than just one customer. But specific to Q3, was this coming from just one large customer, or were there several ones involved here on the Switching side?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","I mean, all we can say is there is a fairly high degree of concentration with hyper-scalers, especially as it pertains to switching in Juniper's business.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, and I would say, I mean, it's not one customer, but it's also not several. I mean, you asked if it's one of those two, it's neither of those.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, all right. And then lastly, my follow-up. If you guys are guiding Routing to be flat next year, given the transition you're seeing, given also the Switching that you said may get to the normal pattern, but there's still kind of a poor visibility on that I suppose at this stage. And then Security is sort of going through the ebbs and flows, it doesn't seem like you will hit your 3% to 6% CAGR target as you've outlined in the past. So shouldn't you be maybe thinking around the flat growth next year? I know you're not providing guidance, but should investor be thinking this is how 2018 is going to shake out, right, given whatever you just said?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. No, so good question. So, let me just talk about Switching for a second. We do expect Switching to grow next year. I think that's important. We've talked about the Tier 2, Tier 3 traction we're getting, which is double-digit growth. QFX all up grew year-on-year even this quarter, with these results with this large spending delay. So we expect Switching to be a growth driver for us.","As it relates to kind of FY 2018 as you mentioned, I'm not giving specific guidance. But I will say this, we are going to be very focused on growing. We think there's an opportunity to grow. That said, we're equally, if not more so, focused on earnings expansion. And that's something that we've \u2013 I believe, we've shown some steps in the last several quarters. And I think we'll continue to show steps in that regard, making sure we focused on operating excellence and taking costs out where we can, but making sure we focus the costs, the investments that we are making in the right areas to enable long-term growth.","We also have a very strong cash flow. As you know, our balance sheet is strong. We have a very sustained capital return program. So I do think we are very focused on bottom line, and we'll continue to be next year.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jayson Noland from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. Rami, you've mentioned SD-WAN a couple of times, I believe. It's a hot category. And Juniper's name doesn't come up that often, crowded market to be fair, I guess. Do you have what you need from a portfolio perspective here? And then how would SD-WAN impact your traditional router market, assuming some success?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jayson. So I'm actually not surprised by your comment that our name doesn't come up all that often, and that's pretty much because we've taken a very deliberate strategy where at least initially, we're focusing our SD-WAN solution on scalable, multitenant, very versatile like extensible architectures with security built in, that are very appealing to our service provider customers.","Service providers all want an SD-WAN strategy and recognize that they need some help with it, and this is essentially what we're doing. We've developed a solution ideally suited for their plans. And we're seeing traction there.","As far as impact to the rest of the Routing business, I know there were all sorts of predictions that this is going to have a deflationary effect on MPLS and so forth. But I have to say that thus far based on conversations with many of our Telco customers where, of course, we enjoy very strong relationships, it hasn't had that effect. I just don't expect it to have any sort of meaningful effect on the need for IP routing or MPLS capabilities in the wide area and in the foreseeable future.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. I'm sorry, Paul, your line is live.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Paul, are you there?","Operator","Well, I think he just disconnected. We'll move on to the next question.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay. We'll go on to the next.","Operator","Yeah, from Michael Genovese from MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC","Great. Thanks a lot. Just in terms of the guidance for the fourth quarter, doesn't seem to envision any type of normal seasonality in the traditional service provider market, certainly no budget flush or normal increase of given seasonality. So can you just talk about that a little bit more, and why you don't expect to see fourth quarter increase in the telco market?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So I think, I mean, we're actually almost at a new normal with Telco. I mean, the last few years, we've seen kind of a challenged market there. And we haven't had big Telco flushes of recent times. We used to have those back in the growth days in the Telco space. But at this point, we expect Telco to remain challenged. I mean that's \u2013 as we all know, a particularly lumpy business. So it's hard to predict with certainty. But I don't expect flushes at this point. In our outlook, we have not assumed an increase in Telco spend in the Q4 because that's just not what we see given the environment that they're in.","Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks for the question.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Rami, can you hear me?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes. We can hear you, Paul. Go ahead.","Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Appreciate it.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Go ahead, Paul.","(53:15)","Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","I apologize returning to the question yet again. But I just want to make sure I understand, and perhaps I'm misinterpreting some stuff you said previously. But when you say that you're disrupting yourself and that drove the issue, and then this is across a number of different, at least more than one player, more than one of the Cloud customers, I'm confused why you didn't \u2013 if you drove yourself, why wouldn't you see the issue, as opposed to the Cloud operators changing their architecture, then advising you to change and it catches you unaware. What's the reconciliation?","And then for Ken...","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, Paul...","(53:57)","Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","On the gross margin, can you remind us \u2013 I think you said in the past that your Cloud customers have the same gross margin (54:07) or corporate average, can you just remind us of that? Thanks, guys.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Paul, to your question about why we could not have predicted this, yes, we did, in fact, develop these products and the solution with an eye that the architectures are going to evolve. What we did not predict and could not have predicted because the plans change for our customers themselves is timing and the pace at which they have moved.","And honestly, I mean, it's impressive despite their size and just how nimble they can be in embracing and deploying new architectural approaches. And again, keep in mind that in the Cloud vertical and where we're seeing the bulk of the sort of the transition that's happening, it's the large Cloud vertical \u2013 the large customers is why it doesn't take all that many to make a meaningful change to our overall business.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, and I just want to clarify, what we're seeing is the pause in between \u2013 in this transition, right? So we're seeing the previous architectures, if you will, the spend slowed down there dramatically as they get ready for the new architecture ramps into the future.","On a gross margin perspective, what we've said and continue to say is the Cloud vertical by itself doesn't have a margin difference. What does drive margin more than customer vertical is technology. So because the Cloud vertical historically has had a higher switching mix than the Telco vertical as an example has a larger \u2013 has a lower margin profile, but it's really due to product not customer at this point.","Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Kind of on the competitive landscape, again, I'm just curious as we look at some of the competitors launching and pushing their Jericho II or Jericho Plus based platforms into the market, how we should think about your guys as competitive positioning as it relates to kind of product cycle cadence, particularly on the router side of the business?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Certainly. So we are keenly aware of the competitive dynamics that are happening all around us, especially in the Cloud space where \u2013 and Routing, which is I think where you really wanted to focus, in the Cloud space where we enjoyed some good footprint.","We developed the PTX from a silicon and software standpoint, as what I believe again to be this perfect blend of Routing and Switching capabilities that can evolve with our customer's architectures.","The roadmap for the PTX, I mean, we get encouraged now by the momentum of the product, and we make sure that we're going to be continuing to invest in ways that keep us ahead of our customer's requirements, and also the competition. And what I believe to be the case here is that the PTX will remain very competitive with the Cloud customer's, in particular, and we'll actually start to gain more traction in other verticals like large enterprise space and telcos over time.","Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And as a real quick follow-up. I'm curious on the realignment efforts, do you have any targeted kind of operating expense reductions? Is this truly just a reinvestment or realignment of investments, or are you expecting to take costs out of the company?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, so we have been taking head count and costs out as we continue to optimize kind of our operations. I would say that it's largely in line with our revenue expectations. We're going to manage OpEx largely in line with revenue. And as we see challenges to the revenue top side and gross margins for that matter, we are going to look to take costs out and protect the bottom line.","Going forward at the same \u2013 the challenge and what we're really focused on is doing that in a way that doesn't hurt the long-term growth of the business, making sure we are investing in the right area, so that's where it goes down to operational excellence ideas. We've done a lot in the past on consolidating and collapsing management, et cetera, and really focused on areas that do save money, but also don't come at the expense of output. So that's really what we're focused on going forward.","Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Muglia, Executive Vice President, Software Solutions division. Please remember, when listening to today's call, that statement concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions, generally or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements for service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC.","All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call.","In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion, will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP to non-GAAP results, please see today's press release.","In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.","On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a GAAP basis other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimate.","Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin R. Johnson","Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. All major financial metrics this quarter were in line or ahead of our guided ranges, and we believe we executed well in what continues to be a challenging environment. The go-forward macro outlook is mixed, but we are focused on what's in our control. We are seeing momentum building in routing, and we see continued growth from our switching portfolio. We are also making good progress on our path to improving the performance of our security business. On the cost side, we are taking steps to reduce ongoing OpEx through a series of targeted efficiency programs over the next several quarters, and Robyn will take you through this in more detail. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong cash position, and we intend to execute against our previously announced repurchase authorization of $1 billion.","I'm going to focus my comments today on our key priorities in this near-term environment and how we are executing against them. I'll provide a brief update on the traction we are seeing in the market, including with our new products, and I've asked Bob Muglia, who heads our Software Solutions division, to join the call to talk about developments in security and software. Robyn will also take you through our financial review and our outlook, and then we will take your questions.","Our second quarter showed some good performance in key areas, with routing and switching driving results. We believe we are doing well in these markets because we bring a portfolio of products and solutions that deliver outstanding value to our customers. Service providers and, increasingly, enterprises are embracing networks that are flatter, that reduce complexity and cost, while also delivering greater performance and scale. We are helping customers drive more efficient OpEx and greater productivity from their networks. The success of this approach we are taking with the customer can be seen in our expanding wireless footprint. There are 3 in the 4 areas we believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our position wireless. One is our MX Series, which provides customers with a single solution for convergence on the Edge. Second is our SRX offering in security. We have built a strong footprint in helping large service providers secure mobile Internet traffic. And third, our new routing solutions to support service providers as they drive efficiency by collapsing multiple networks in the core. Our PTX offering is off to a good start, and we're deeply engaged with Verizon and others with this solution. Our ACX Universal Access router is also shipping this quarter and is well positioned for the backhaul infrastructure necessary to carry rapidly increasing amounts of mobile traffic.","As we look after the second half of the year, we continue to monitor the macro environment closely. We feel pretty good about the U.S. Tier 1 service providers based on our level of engagement and conversations with them. We believe the data points suggest that we can anticipate a modest increase in second half spend as compared to the first half. And as a result, the overall U.S. markets should continue to be an area of strength for us in the second half of the year. This is offset, however, by uncertainty in Europe and slowing growth in some emerging markets.","On the Enterprise side, our switching portfolio, along with QFabric, drove strong performance in the Enterprise. I'm pleased to note that General Dynamics, a leading global systems integrator in the aerospace and defense industries, has deployed QFabric as part of its core network in 2 of its U.S. data centers. QFabric was chosen by General Dynamics for its ability to deliver scale, performance and flexibility needed to deliver critical applications in support of their mission. We have momentum in switching, and we believe we will continue to outgrow the market, despite the current mixed outlook for overall Enterprise spending. We believe the public sector market will be challenging in light of the austerity measures in a number of countries and budget constraints in the U.S.","In security, we are very focused on improving our market position. SRX remains a strong product for customers where scale matters, both at service providers and large enterprises. And as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we have a clear path to strengthen other elements of our portfolio. The new security designer offering is one example, and we like how the solution is coming together. Bob will fill you in more in a moment.","Looking out over the second half of the year, we are focused on execution near term, while positioning the company to deliver on its long-term growth objectives. To that end, we have 3 clear near-term priorities. First, continue to drive momentum of our new products with the right sales and marketing efforts. We're encouraged by our early progress, particularly with our routing and data center offerings. We set our revenue targets for new innovations at the Analyst Meeting, and we are very focused on those. Second, we are aligning our resources with focus on the right projects and activities that drive performance now and keep us on a path to deliver meaningful innovations to our customers. The priorities include revenue generation, customer satisfaction and the next wave of innovation at Juniper. Third, we are aligning our overall cost structure for efficiency and effectiveness. We are focused on driving operational excellence and productivity throughout the organization. We are committed to delivering against the long-term model we laid out at the Analyst Meeting. This includes ongoing initiatives across the company in areas like supply chain, procurement, systems and processes, shared services and more.","We're also taking steps with respect to our cost structure and Robyn will take you through that in more detail shortly.","So to wrap up, we had a good second quarter. We believe we have executed well in the first half of 2012 that has remained challenging. We're delivering good performance relative to the market in routing and switching, and we are on a defined path to strengthen our product set and security. Our new products are gaining traction in the market, and we will continue to ramp this year and next. As we look to the second half of the year, we are not planning for any improvement in the macro environment. To manage through this period, we've set clear priorities for how we run the business with revenue generation, resource allocation and careful cost management all top of mind.","Thanks again for your time today, and I'll now turn the floor over to Bob Muglia. Bob?","Robert L. Muglia","Great. Thanks, Kevin. It's great to be on the call with everyone today. Last month at FAM, Stefan and I shared our view of the new network architecture, how we've aligned our 2 divisions around the domain-driven approach that syncs with our customers' view of their network and how we're approaching the marketplace from both the R&D and go-to-market perspectives.","Just to recap that briefly, our business is organized around 2 divisions: Systems and Software. Within the Software Division at Juniper, our philosophy is that software complements our systems. So our 2 divisions work closely together. In each division, we target 3 businesses: routing, switching and security. And for those businesses, we focus around the 7 domains that comprise the major components of the network, whether we're talking to Service Provider or Enterprise customers. This approach, 2 customer segments, 3 businesses and 7 domains, or 2-3-7, enables Juniper to conduct business-focused conversations with our customers, leveraging our unique understanding of networking technology and innovation to help them address their most pressing business challenges.","With that as a backdrop, what I'd like to do with my time here today is zero in a little more on our strategy and progress in security and how that relates to our broader activities in software development, as well as the Riverbed relationship that we announced earlier today. I'll start with security as that has been a major area of focus for me since I arrived at Juniper last year. We continue to be pleased with our leadership position for the high-end SRX within the Service Provider community. In Q2, we saw good high-end SRX sales to SPs based largely on the growth of LTE networks and the benefit the SRX provides to the solution. We recognized that we have work to do to regain our momentum in Enterprise security, but in Q2 we did see quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth in Enterprise security for the first time in quite a while.","As we have commented recently, we are enhancing the features and capabilities of the SRX platform to meet the needs of all enterprises, from large customers to smaller deployments at the campus and branch level. In the short term, we are focused on management and the AppSecure portfolio, our application visibility and control solution.","We are also building on our success in network security to deliver a next-generation content security services, including building on our recent acquisition of Mykonos, thus enabling security intelligence across the entire security ecosystem and transforming the customer experience.","Our focus on network management starts with Security Design, which we talked about at FAM. This is an application hosted on the Junos Space platform. The interface is designed from the ground up to handle the breadth the security management challenges, including NextGen firewall, PoP firewall policy, IPS, network address translation policy and perhaps most importantly, VPN management. We've had 2 releases of the product thus far, and security design is now deployed in production within a Tier 1 service provider. We've collected a considerable amount of customer feedback from Enterprise accounts to whom we've given early access to the technology, and we are quite pleased with their response.","We have put a significant investment in terms of both R&D and customer engagement into developing Security Design, and we believe it provides us with very capable security management. Further releases later this year of Security Design will reflect the feedback we have received, and we expect to see deployments beginning in Q4 continuing through 2013.","Hopefully, you saw our press announcement today regarding our technology relationship with Riverbed. I wanted to spend a few minutes on this because it will also play into our broader software strategy, including security. This relationship recognizes the key role application acceleration plays as the network and application layers begin to converge. Both Juniper and Riverbed are focused on delivering high-performance security and scale in this environment. As a part of the Riverbed relationship, we are pleased that Riverbed has selected Junos Pulse as the mobile client for the delivery of their industry-leading application acceleration solution. A key part of the relationship is our licensing of Riverbed's Layer 7 application delivery controller technology. We plan to leverage this technology as a component in building out integrated solutions for scaling data center applications within the network. There will be multiple components to this integrated solution, existing Juniper systems and software capabilities, license technologies such as Riverbed's and new technologies that we are developing internally over time.","The relationship with Riverbed is an important one as we think about our overall strategy for software within the context of market trends. We start with the premise that software is core to our innovation strategy. It complements our systems. Today, we have licensed strategic technology for application delivery that complements our existing platform and software assets. This is important for the long term. The Juniper products that we will build using the application delivery controller technology won't ship for some time. Yet it's clear, with the evolution of the new network, that software such as this will play a bigger and bigger role across the routing, switching and security businesses we serve. We're making foundational investments today that position us well as the new network becomes more software-defined.","In summary, this is an important time for the industry and for Juniper. And software programmability will be key to the new network and -- of which software will play a major role. We have a history in this space, and we are investing today in building on our strengths, both organically and via acquisitions of key technology. We approach this opportunity that way we always approach innovation, with a strong focus on understanding the customer and their needs. Security plays a major role in these efforts and our business overall. While we have been clear about some of the challenges we have had in the Enterprise, we have made substantive progress and are positioned well for the future. We know where we need to be and how to get there. Security is a dynamic market, and it is changing rapidly, driven in particular by the impact of mobility. That creates the opportunity for us to grow in this market. With the strength of the SRX platform and the innovation underway with the Security Design, we're well positioned and focused on executing our plan.","Thanks for your time, and I'll turn it now over to Robyn.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Juniper's results in the second quarter were slightly higher than our guided ranges and reflected better operational performance. We remain focused on executing our strategy to drive revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. We believe the long-term demand fundamentals for high-performance networking are solid, yet the near-term environment continues to be uncertain and many customers remain cautious.","Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, book-to-bill was greater than 1, and product deferred revenue and product backlog increased sequentially. We saw good customer demand for our new products, including the PTX, T4000 and QFabric.","Total revenue was $1,074,000,000, a 4% sequential increase and a decline of 4% year-over-year. As anticipated, the sequential increase was due to good Enterprise and Service Provider growth in the Americas, which offset weakness in the other regions. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to Service Provider weakness in EMEA and in APAC.","In the second quarter, Verizon accounted for approximately 12% of Juniper's total revenue. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks. It also reflects initial revenue from their recently announced deployment of PTX.","For the second quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.11. This includes a $0.02 gain from equity investments. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19, up $0.03 sequentially and down $0.12 year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to improved revenue and margin.","Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the second quarter, the Americas were approximately 55% of total revenue; EMEA, 28%; and APAC, 17%. Americas revenue was up 11% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to broad-based Enterprise strength with the exception of federal and financial services. In Service Provider, we saw higher revenue from cable, content and some wireless and wireline customers. On a year-over-year basis, the growth was driven by Service Provider.","EMEA revenue was down 3% sequentially and 9% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing weakness in Service Providers. We see customers in EMEA continuing to take a cautious stance with their CapEx in response to the uncertain macro environment.","APAC revenue was down 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. In Service Provider, APAC, excluding Japan, was up 10% sequentially. We continue to capture design wins with Service Providers in the region. Year-over-year, most of the region declined as a result of lower Service Provider demand.","Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platforms Systems division revenue was $872 million, up 6% sequentially and down 5% year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $488 million, up 7% sequentially and down 16% year-over-year. We had sequential increases in both Edge and core routing. Year-over-year, we saw a modest increase in core routing, which was more than offset by a decline in Edge routing. Total router product revenue, including both PSD and SSD, increased 6% from Q1 to $506 million. We saw a good sequential increase in revenue from both T4000 and PTX.","Total switching product revenue increased 13% to $140 million. We are pleased with the momentum of EX, QFabric and wireless LAN, which all grew sequentially and year-over-year. SSD revenue in the second quarter was $202 million, down 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $159 million, down 6% sequentially and flat year-over-year. The sequential decline was the result of slower demand in Service Provider and growth in Enterprise. As expected, high-end SRX product revenue declined sequentially and grew year-over-year as customer deployment timing continues to drive fluctuations in Service Provider revenues for this product.","In the quarter, we did see a good sequential increase in Enterprise. We continue to see good customer traction with recent design wins with financial services and internet phones.","Branch SRX, which is reported as part of PSD, was up both sequentially and year-over-year.","Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $681 million, down 1% sequentially. Revenue was down 7% on a year-over-year basis as weakness in APAC and EMEA offset strength in the Americas. Enterprise revenue was $393 million, up 13% sequentially and flat year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, growth in EMEA and APAC offset a moderate decline in the Americas.","For the quarter, Service Provider was 64% of total revenue and Enterprise was 36% of total revenue.","Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter increased to 63.4% compared to 62.6% last quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins were flat with the first quarter. A favorable routing mix was offset by a higher switching mix and some cost increases in security. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 59.4%, up 2.6 points from the prior quarter. This was a result of a higher revenue due to service contract renewals and lower costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased sequentially to $520 million.","Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,373 employees, a sequential increase of 155 as we continue to hire in sales and service with the goal of driving revenue growth.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 15%. This sequential increase of 3 points was due to higher revenue and improved gross margins and slightly lower operating expenses.","Looking at segment contribution margins, PSD contribution margin was 40.3% of revenue, up sequentially on improved revenue and gross margins. For SSD, contribution margin was 36.8% of revenues, which is slightly lower sequentially due to decreased revenue and margins, partially offset by reduced operating expenses.","The GAAP tax rate was 35.5% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 30.7%, 4.9 points above the prior quarter due primarily to the geographic mix of income. As a reminder, the tax rate reflects the expiration of the R&D tax credits.","Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion of net cash and investments. Cash flow from operations was $212 million. Cash flow was up sequentially, reflecting higher earnings and good working capital performance. DSO was 34 days in the quarter, down from 39 days last quarter and in the second quarter of last year. Capital expenditures and depreciation were up slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to build out our Sunnyvale campus. We repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $94 million, an increase of -- over the prior 2 quarters.","Now I will review our outlook for the third quarter. And as a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we expect customers to remain cautious. We anticipate ongoing weakness in EMEA through the balance of the year, and that Enterprise markets globally will continue to invest carefully. We are making good progress on our new product introductions, and we remain focused on driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,040,000,000 to $1,075,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be roughly flat sequentially at the high end of the revenue range. Operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately $10 million due to annual employee merit increases. We expect operating margins to range from 13% to 14%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.18 per share, assuming a flat share count, a tax rate of 31% and no renewal of the R&D tax credits.","Before we go to Q&A, I'd also like to update you on 2 topics we discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting in June. First, we recently announced a $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. Given the current market, we intend to be more opportunistic in the near term. Obviously, we will calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time. But based on current trends, we clearly recognize the opportunity to do more. The second update is around our productivity and efficiency initiatives. As I outlined at FAM, actions are currently underway that will reduce ongoing operating expenses. In 2013, we anticipate an operating expense reduction of approximately $150 million over our estimated 2012 levels, with benefits beginning to be reflected in Q1 and the majority of the reduction occurring in the second half of 2013.","In summary, given our view of the challenging near-term market conditions, we will continue to execute with agility and flexibility, while balancing the long-term needs of the business to deliver innovation and revenue growth. I would like to thank our dedicated employees for their hard work and commitment. They continue to be key to our success in delivering the new network.","And now, I will hand it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I actually have a couple. Kevin, just a clarification. When you're talking about wireless and a lot of opportunities you're getting in wireless, you didn't mention MobileNext so I was wondering if that was kind of a -- just a slip-up or intentionally that wasn't really maybe the emphasis on MobileNext. So that was just kind of a clarification. Robyn, you're talking about the gross margin mix, and you said that routing was a positive driver of gross margin, but then was offset by a negative gross margin mix in switching. I'm wondering, is that negative gross margin based on switching mix? In switching, it's hard to say, due to the entry of QFabric into the switching mix. And if so, can you give us a sense as to how large QFabric was and what you expect that to be in the next quarter and going forward and give us a sense as to how that grows? And if it doesn't, that gross margin [indiscernible]?","Kevin R. Johnson","Thanks for your question, Ehud, I'll take the first question on MobileNext. Certainly, MobileNext, we've made a lot of progress on MobileNext from a feature capability standpoint. And the key enabler that MobileNext drives for us, this gets the MX -- it's one of the services of that can run on the MX to make the MX an established footprint on the edge of the network in the wireless side. And we've seen a lot of adoption of the MX as it's engaged with customers on the wireless side, in the addition to the wireline side. MobileNext will continue to build out new sets of features. I'll let Bob talk a little bit about the new feature capabilities. We're making slow but steady progress on MobileNext. But the key for MobileNext is to establish the MX as a footprint in the wireless, and we're pleased with the progress we're seeing in the MX, and we continue to focus on the work that we're doing with MobileNext. Bob, do you want to comment just briefly on...","Robert L. Muglia","Yes, I'll add to that. We've shipped the EPC capabilities and GGSN capabilities of MobileNext and that is in production right now and running well at Elisa. And we're getting feedback from our customers that there are a set of additional features that they're interested in seeing from us. Consistent with what we set at FAM, these include things like the enforcement capabilities and DPI capabilities. All of these things, EPC, DPI, the PCEF enforcement capabilities are all part of the Universal Edge and the set of broad services that run on our MX platform. And the unique thing about that is that it provides these broad services for both wireline and wireless customers.","Robyn M. Denholm","And so Ehud, in terms of the mix comment on the call, yes, router mix was favorable in the quarter. The other thing I mentioned on the call was that it was offset by a few costs on the security side, which has to do with our deployments of some recently -- some recent wins in terms of the security side. So that's what I mentioned that was offsetting the favorable mix on the router side.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was actually talking about QFabric. Can you give us a sense as to how large that was and has that impacted gross margin at all on the router side?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. So in terms of QFabric, we were pleased with the performance of all 3 lines of business in the switching area. Both EX, QFabric and wireless LAN were all up sequentially and year-over-year. And in terms of gross margin, that was a -- no impact on the gross margin average.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The routing was better than expected in the quarter even though you highlighted some of the weakness in EMEA at Service Providers and also even though Verizon was down sequentially. So can you just give us a bit more detail on what drove the upside there? And also just as an update on the T4000, which I know you highlighted, the revenues in that product, are they still tied to qualification or are we seeing actual deployments? And if not, then when do you think we'll see the deployment revenue for that product?","Kevin R. Johnson","Thanks for the question, Simona. I'll take the second question and then we'll let Robyn comment on the overall router revenues for expectations. The T4000 is -- as we come out with that product, keep in mind, it's a seamless upgrade to the existing T Series chassis. And what we see customers doing now, we have a number of customers who have purchased and implemented the chassis kit that allows those chassis now to be provisioned to be able to accept both the older T Series line cards, as well as the new T Series, T4000 line cards. And then consistent with the way service providers go, a number of them are going through certification testing and -- in that process. But I think we're pleased with the level of engagement that we've gotten, both with PTX and T4000 in the core. And we're going to continue to stay focused as we work with customers through the certification process and then certainly as they do line card upgrades that presents more opportunity for us.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. And in terms of the overall mix of routing, both core and Edge were up quarter-over-quarter. Core was also up year-over-year, which is obviously a favorable trend for the quarter. So we were pleased with the routing mix in the quarter.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But just as far as a little bit of additional detail, could you just highlight the source of that sequential increase? Because just by process of elimination, it sounds like it was not EMEA and it was not Verizon. So if you can just highlight a bit more, if any, incremental new wins or upgrades or what might be happening just with your other customers.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, thanks, Simona. I think -- it clearly was more U.S.-driven offset by some of the weakness in Europe. And certainty, within the U.S., our Tier 1 Service Provider business performed well in addition to that. So if you look at certain sectors of the U.S. like the cable customers that we engage with, cable did well. There was also a strong performance in U.S. cable providers and it's consistent with the value proposition and the messaging that we have overall in routing. But I'd say, net-wise, it was mainly driven by strength in the U.S. It's a combination of Tier 1, as well as our cable segment, and offset a little bit by some of the weakness in Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just one clarification for Robyn and then a question. Clarification is on the gross margins in services. Robyn, you said that one of the drivers for the better margins were costs. I just wonder if you could elaborate on that a little bit in terms of what you guys have changed with respect to costs there that helped the gross margins? And then the question is on the Riverbed deal. I think I heard you guys say that it'd be some time before you'd ship products that would incorporate that Riverbed ADC software, which makes sense. I just wonder if, in the meantime, there's any opportunity to do joint deals or any kind of partnership out in the channel to serve customer needs?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, I'll talk about the gross margin and then I'll hand it over to Bob. So in terms of services gross margin, it was good sequential increase in terms of gross margins for services, driven by revenue growth quarter-over-quarter and also by cost, as you mentioned, Rod. So on the cost side, we've been talking about increased costs in the services space for a while due to architectural personnel and increased sparing and increased services capability to do with our new product introductions. So clearly, good cost management on an ongoing basis by the team in Services also helped this quarter with our gross margins.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Did you -- Robyn, did you guys actually hold costs stable while revenues grew? Is that more what happened? Or did you actually reduced costs?","Robyn M. Denholm","We did reduce cost a little bit but also revenues increased in the quarter. So it's a combination of both, that's why I talked about both on the call.","Robert L. Muglia","So in the context of the Riverbed relationship, there are really 2 parts to the relationship. One part is working with Riverbed to incorporate their application acceleration technology into the Pulse mobile client. And we will not really be very able to do a lot of go to market work with them in that space until that technology is integrated in, but that is on its own schedule and we'll work with them to get ship dates at a little time. The second piece is really the ADC technology that we licensed from them, and we would anticipate that technology being built into Juniper products and being delivered to the market as a Juniper set of products. So we are not -- there's plans to resell the Riverbed technology in that space.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Bob, I guess what I was wondering is that it sounds like the ADC will take a while to build into products. It's not going to happen overnight. So -- but I assume that that's driven by a customer need. Customers are wanting some ADC integration. Is there any -- and there's no opportunity to work with them to do joint solutions for customers or something like that?","Robert L. Muglia","Well, there's always an opportunity and it was not -- there's nothing specific to announce at this time on that. But we definitely see that this technology is very interesting. We see there's an opportunity for software to add value on top of the systems that we build. It is particularly interesting in the data center space. This is one of the good examples of software services that are very complementary. We also see long term that, that technology is beneficial in other domains such as the Edge in the Service Provider space.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Marshall with the ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A question with respect to gross margins and then a follow-up on the financial model. But if you look at it, your revenues were up about 4% sequential in the quarter, but your gross margins were up almost roughly 100 basis points sequentially. So I think that would imply that you have an increasing richness of the revenue mix as not all that improvements came from increased volumes. I guess I'd love to hear the puts and takes there. And then also how that transitions with respect to the September quarter because I would expect that the new products will be ramping faster than the older products and some of them carry, obviously, higher gross margins associated with them. And so at the high end of the revenue guidance implies flat gross margins. I guess I would expect they would be actually a little bit higher than that, so would love some commentary there. And then a follow-up would be, can you talk a little bit about that 2% -- I'm sorry, $0.02 dilution hit at well? I apologize, I was -- actually missed the prepared remarks.","Robyn M. Denholm","So in terms of the mix in the quarter affecting gross margin, yes, routing mix was up in the quarter, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that core was up both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And as we've discussed, that does have a favorable impact in terms of gross margins. So we're pleased with the gross margin performance in the quarter and do see that, at the high end of guidance, continuing into the third quarter. In terms of the $0.02, we talked about a $0.02 favorable impact to the operating income due to a gain on investments. I think that was the question. Was that the question, Brian?","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I guess. A follow-up on the September gross margins. I mean, all things else being equal, if you're flat sequentially on the revenue side, I would anticipate that you have an increasing richness of the mix and so margins would be up. So I guess, can you talk a little bit about what the offsets are that will be pulling that down, if that would be the case?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. So in terms of our guidance for the third quarter, in terms of the trends that we see, we obviously see a continuing weakness in EMEA in Service Provider through the end of the year. Kevin mentioned that and so did I. We also see continued positive momentum with the U.S. Service Providers. And obviously, we also see some opportunities to increase revenue in terms of Enterprise. So in terms of mix, we're really calling it to be roughly flat going forward between Service Provider and Enterprise growth there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a clarification. Just -- the Riverbed on the ADC side, does that mean your Radware partnership ends? And then the question is, with the assumption of a better second half, what sort of seasonality should we expect later in the year? Should we think of similar sequential growth levels from last year, or should we think of normal teen sequential growth rates? I ask since U.S. service providers are improving but the environment is still tough. And the European carriers, it's been so long since they've upgraded their networks. It seems like they are due for a big upgrade. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how you feel about the -- how we finish the balance of the year.","Robert L. Muglia","I'll take the regular question first. No, it does not mean that our Radware partnership ends. In fact, we continue to work closely with Radware and delivery of their technology on top of the MX platform to a variety of customers particularly focused on the service provider edge. And we'll be pleased, even after we have product in the market that does application -- that does ADC technology on our own. We'll be pleased to continue to work with Riverbed and service customers that want to use their technology.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes. And Mark, I'll take the second part of your question on seasonality. What we see with U.S. Tier 1 service providers, seasonality first half versus second half is returning to sort of the more expected pattern that we saw with the exception of last year. We think second half spending by the Tier 1 service providers in the U.S. will be higher than first half. If you just look at their guided CapEx, something like 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half is what you look at. But if you just take the Tier 1 service providers, they only represent about 25% of the total CapEx globally, and I think the uptick in U.S., I think, is offset by the weakness that we see in Europe and other parts of Asia-Pacific. So the net is I think we're taking a cautious position given the macro environment in Europe and continue to play to our strength with our business in the U.S.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, just a quick thought. The networks -- a lot of the networks in Europe seem to be running above service-level agreements, which implies that they have to upgrade. What's the kind of feedback? Is it just still their -- the macro for them, their balance sheets or their CapEx? And do you think that we'll get to a point where they have to upgrade?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, it's a good question, Mark, and I think we've seen this pattern before. The long-term demand fundamentals of growth in network traffic continue. There's more devices, there's more video, there's more users, there's more data centers, there's just more traffic. So as traffic continues to grow and if there's a slowdown or pause in some of the capital expenditures for routing in the service provider sector, certainly that implies that customers are running their network hotter, and that will be consistent with our view and our engagement with customers. The question will be at what point do they either hit the point where they're running so hot that they need to make the investments, or at what point do the economic conditions for those customers hit the situation where they start to do upgrades and build more capacity in their networks? But the important point, I think, is the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact. Traffic continues to grow, and every customer situation is different. In certain cases, it may be a function of their revenue. In some cases, it's a function of their balance sheet. In some cases, they're being cautious given the economic situation in the country that they reside. But what we're doing is we're being very focused and very connected on -- with those customers to ensure that we're working proactively with them so that when they do start to spend and upgrade and launch new projects, that Juniper is there with a great value proposition and prepared to help them do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Robyn, a question for you on the OpEx. The numbers that you're providing are for a full year comparison of 2012 to 2013? And then the second part of that is, why would it take so long for the reductions to filter into the financials?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. So in terms of what I talked about in the prepared remarks, the $150 million reduction in OpEx for 2013 is the full year-over-full year impact. What we're expecting to see is that impact really starts to come in, in Q1 of next year and increase over the full year. And so as I said in my prepared remarks, the second half of the year is where we see the majority of the reduction happening.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Why not get started on that process a little sooner? And then furthermore, are there specific areas that we should be watching for the reductions?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, yes. As I outlined in FAM, I mean, we're working on productivity and efficiency initiatives across the company. So it's quite surgical. There are the things that we're actually targeting in terms of sort of long-standing cost reduction activity rather than just one set of being in one area. It's across the board, whether it's in streamlining things in the back-office function, as well as in the R&D area, as well as in sales and marketing as well.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, I'll just add, Jeff, we're not waiting for some of that. We're working on this, and we will get these -- the cost structure in place as soon as practical, and we're trying to be very thoughtful about how we do that, so that we maintain a focus on the priorities we have, which are driving the revenue, top-line revenue, continue to drive the wave of innovation. But gaining these efficiencies, a lot of what Robyn described is through efficiency gains which has to do with process change and  underlying systems that get aligned with them. But we aren't waiting. We're moving, and we will get these as soon as practical.","James Kelleher - Argus Research Company","Okay. Kevin, can I just ask you, observations on VMware's move into the space with Nicira, what are your takeaways on that deal?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, thanks for the question, Jeff. I think at the Analyst Meeting in early June, Pradeep, Stefan and Bob, I think, shared our view of software-defined networks and our focus on this. We certainly are aligned with the goals and where software-defined network are going. We, I think, at the Analyst Meeting, outlined how we described that 3 years ago with our launch of the concept of the new network. We certainly have been very engaged with the industry and the community as it relates to software-defined networks, and we will continue to stay very engaged in it. I think if you look at the comments that Pradeep made, we're going to continue to be very thoughtful and balanced in terms of what we're doing on the R&D agenda to make sure that we're delivering the best possible solutions to our customers. And certainly, the work we're doing in our switching and fabric business as it relates to data centers is very applicable and very relevant to Nicira and very applicable and relevant to what VMware is doing. That said, we're going to continue to focus on how we can innovate and deliver the best possible solutions to customers in a world of software-defined networks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies.","George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just expanding on that thought. I guess I'm wondering when Juniper might be able to deliver a product in the SDN area. Is there a set of timelines or dates that you guys have in mind? And then also on QFabric, I guess I was just hoping to get an update on customer count there and any more comments or tangible data points you have on traction with QFabric could be helpful.","Robert L. Muglia","Let me take the first question of when we'll be delivering products in the SDN space. We already have today a number of products that have many attributes of SDN, and I'll first point out that when the industry talks about SDN, there's a great deal of similarity to the programmable network, which we've been talking about for several years. SDN is really all about how applications in the infrastructure that support them can drive the network and get the network to do what it wants. And that's really precisely the same goal we outlined several years ago when we talked about the programmable network. So the work we've done to date in building the Junos SDK is really industry-leading work that is completely consistent with SDN. In specific areas of SDN, things like OpenFlow, we have today some open-source capabilities for people to build on top of our platforms, and we're in the process of building production capable OpenFlow technology across a wide variety of Juniper products going into 2013. So you're seeing -- what I would say is we have products today, and we're going to continue to enhance and expand those products, and we'll work very closely across the industry, including with partners like VMware, to ensure that Juniper Networks, the platforms and the software that we provide is the best complement to the software that they deliver.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, George, I'll give you sort of a quick update on QFabric. I think at the end of our last quarter call, we had mentioned, I think, we had 150 customers running QFabric nodes. In this quarter, in second quarter, we surpassed the 200 customer mark running QFabric nodes. And so we continue to see very good uptake of customers running QFabric nodes, and certainly, we're seeing a growing number of those customers also now purchase and either go through certification or deployment of the full QFabric systems. We announced the -- a new interconnect system called the QFX3000-M and this is important in a relevant point because it is a fixed interconnect that provides QFabric for up to 16 nodes. And so it provides a lower entry point for those customers who have purchased and deployed nodes who now want to try the full QFabric system. They can deploy the QFX3000-M, and it lowers the entry point and provides them flexibility in terms of how they want to deploy that in a fixed interconnect node. So we've got -- we've surpassed 200 customers in the quarter, continued to see good progress on the QFX3500 with the top-of-rack and the nodes and certainly, a subset of those customers purchasing continue to deploy the full QFabric system.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse.","Paul Silverstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of quick ones. First off, Kevin or Robyn, can you comment on linearity in the quarter as well as closed rates? Secondly, with respect to absolute run [ph] optimization, curious, Kevin, have you gone back and looked at -- what's different this time around relative to back in '05 when you purchased Redline and Peribit, which if I remember correctly, Peribit was the leader at the time it went up. Redline was a pretty decent private company as well. What's different about this initiative relative to that last go-around in terms of driving revenue and bottom line? And finally, Robyn, curious, the $150 million number for the OpEx savings for next year, it doesn't sound like you have a staff reduction target. This isn't coming from headcount reduction, maybe I misunderstood. If that's the case, how did you come up with $150 million?","Robyn M. Denholm","So Paul, let me tackle the first question and the last one. In terms of linearity, nothing unusual to comment on in terms of linearity for the quarter. You can see with the DSO that we had that it was a relatively linear quarter. So nothing unusual to comment there. In terms of the cost reductions, let me start by saying where our strategy is around driving revenue growth. We talked about that in the -- at the Analyst Day. We're very focused on doing that. We're also focused on driving operational execution across the board, whether it is to drive that revenue growth or reduce our percentage of OpEx to revenue. And as I outlined at FAM, we are targeted at 39% to 42% of revenue as our OpEx over the next 3 years. So these -- what I've announced today is that we've now -- at FAM I talked about -- we had identified opportunities in that range, now we've identified those cost savings, and we're in the process of implementing those as we speak. So we will talk more about those as we start to show the amounts in the P&L. But we're very focused on delivering both, both revenue growth and operating expense efficiencies.","Robert L. Muglia","So -- and with regards to the question about the previous acquisitions that Juniper did quite some time ago relative to the work that we'll be doing around, particularly the ADC space, I can't say too much about what happened a long time ago.  I certainly wasn't here then. But I will say that today, as we sit here, we have a great deal of clarity across the 2 customer segments that we're targeting, the Service Provider and the Enterprise, the 3 businesses we're in, switching, security and routing, and then the 7 domains. And in particular, with the domains, it provides us a deep context of understanding of customers' business needs, and we see this technology as being critical to fulfill those needs, and that's why we've done the -- we've created the relationship that we have, and we think it's a good, sound financial decision, and we think it's a good business opportunity for us going forward.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes. And Paul, this is Kevin. I'll just add to Bob's comments. I think we are in the switching fabric business in the data center today. We were not back then. And so there's clearly, in our opinion, a technology synergy related to the ADC and the systems. The fact that we built Layer 2, Layer 3, load balancing into our underlying systems and then complement that now with Layer 7 ADC in systems like MXs, SRX and QFabric allows us to bring this technology in form of a line card that now is tightly integrated into the systems. I think that's the fundamental difference in both footprint, technology capabilities and synergies in terms of how we go to market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First is on the security part. Bob, you spoke about grade investments in security but revenues this quarter were down 6% sequentially. How do you -- or when do you see the new efforts contributing to revenues? And how do you see the rest of the year playing out in security? How are you -- if you can repeat a little bit, I think you highlighted how you're going to innovate -- differentiate versus competition? The second question is clarification about what you said on ADC. I don't understand why you're going to have 2 different pieces of software, one from Radware, one from Riverbed, and invest in both and try to integrate and try to educate the salespeople on both, and how does it work with your desire to lower costs, so where is the rationale in keeping both?","Robert L. Muglia","Okay. Let me take those one at a time. Thanks a lot for the question. The first one with regards to security, in terms of the quarter-to-quarter overall decline. I mean, what you're seeing there is somewhat the cyclic nature of Service Provider buying. As we mentioned, we saw growth, both quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, in Enterprise, which tends to have a more consistent curve attached to it. In terms of when the time frames for when we see ourselves being able to have more consistent growth, we will see as the new products and technologies come out later this year and we see customer adoption. We do feel that going into 2013, our security business will be seeing very consistent recovery, and we've made a wide variety of steps within the security business to really address the challenges we have, including putting effectively an entirely new management team in place, which is well established now and has -- and is now executing very effectively on the initiatives in front of them. So I feel good about the steps that have been taken and the progress that we're making. I feel good about the feedback that we are seeing from customers and where we're heading with that business. With regards to the question about ADC and the 2 different packages, recognize that our relationship with Radware is one where they do development on top of the SDK that we provide and then we work together to deliver our solutions to particular customers. We do that quite a bit with a wide variety of different partners in the industry, and it's actually in our benefit to have an open ecosystem to allow others to build on top of our platforms. And so it makes sense for us to continue to do that. In terms of our R&D investment, it will be focused on the Riverbed technology. That's where we'll be putting our own investment. And in terms of bringing Juniper-based products to market, it will be based on that technology. But as I mentioned, that is still some time away, still a little while before we'll have the product to market.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you. That is all the time we have today.

[Operator Instructions]  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here on the call are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; Bob Muglia, Executive Vice President, Software Solutions Division; and Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Platform Systems division.","Before we continue, I would like to highlight some planned changes to our earnings release format that will be implemented next quarter. Starting with our first quarter 2013 earnings, we will no longer be including certain financial tables within our earnings press release, but we will continue to make them available for download in Excel format on the Investor Relations section of Juniper's website. The financial tables are noted in the appendix of today's fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings press release and include segment operating results, share-based compensation by category, share-based compensation related to tax by category and reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results related to the tables I just referenced. We believe this change will simplify and streamline the earnings press release format while continuing to make valuable information available to our shareholders.","Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry; changes in overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and major customers; the network capacity requirements of service providers; the timing of orders and shipments; manufacturing and supply chain constraints; variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products; rapid technological and market change; litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call.","In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.","On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimate.","Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour, and please limit your questions to 1 per firm. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin R. Johnson","Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Juniper finished the year on a good note, exceeding our Q4 guidance. Robyn will review the financial results shortly. Certainly, 2012 was a challenging year given the global macroenvironment, and we have focused on controlling the things that are within our control and improving execution.","I think we've made solid progress in a number of key areas. First, we strengthened our product portfolio and introduced breakthrough technologies over the past year. We are gaining traction in the marketplace as we execute against a multiyear strategy that will help us embrace the ongoing transition in the networking industry towards flatter, more scalable network architectures. This is evident in the new products we have brought to market in routing, switching and security.","In addition, we've also made important improvements to many of our existing products with new features, enhanced performance capabilities and quality improvements. This includes our security portfolio, where we have made and continue to make key advancements to strengthen our offerings and narrow competitive gaps.","In addition, we have clearly stated a path for Juniper to leverage our assets and embrace the concept of software-defined networks. Bob Muglia will share some more details on security and SDN in a few moments.","The second area of progress in 2012 was excellence in execution, focusing on our innovation strategy and on the things we can control. Last fall, we announced a set of restructuring efforts designed to sharpen our focus, drive efficiencies and enable agility throughout the organization. We're also well along the path where we've improved our sales pipeline and forecasting execution, R&D execution to deliver innovation and product quality, and customer service and support execution. We also strengthened our capabilities and business processes and key internal management systems, which will further improve our ability to execute. There's always more to do to drive continuous improvement, and this will continue to be a focus in 2013. From my perspective, Juniper is already executing at a higher level, and this adds to my confidence as we enter the new year.","Third area of focus is around capital allocation. Juniper consistently delivers strong operating cash flows, and we're being very thoughtful about how we allocate these dollars across investment priorities that drive growth and opportunities to enhance shareholder returns. We will continue to be thoughtful in our capital allocation throughout 2013.","The progress in each of these areas lays the foundation for improving performance in 2013. But before I get into our business outlook, I want to touch on the announcement we made last week around software-defined networking at our annual Global Partners Conference. I want to highlight a couple of points. There's been a lot of talk, and in many cases, a lot of hype around SDN. We were relatively quiet on the topic in 2012, but in the background, we were hard at work on our strategy and plans. We recognize this is an inflection point in the industry, and we share the view that SDN will play a transformational role in networking. Juniper has played a critical role in prior transformational moments in networking, and we see this as the next big transition.","A couple of things are clear today. One, it's early. That's evident in the variety of approaches beginning to emerge in the industry. Two, the vision and strategy we laid out last week defines a comprehensive path that we believe leverages our heritage, is the innovation leader in high-performance networking and puts us in a good position to execute and create value, both for our customers and our shareholders. Bob will comment on this further in a minute.","I'd like to focus the remainder of my remarks on how Juniper is positioning itself for 2013. The macro and spending environments remain mixed with the beginning signs of increased project activity in service providers, offset somewhat by weakness in U.S. federal and other parts of the enterprise. Macroenvironment in Europe remains challenging. That said, we are playing offense and we're focused on making solid progress against the targets in our long-term financial model. We enter the year in a good position. As I've discussed, we're stronger operationally. We're more focused and more agile. The company is well prepared for growth.","In routing, innovative new products like PTX and ACX are gaining traction. This is evident in the fourth quarter. The flagship MX family of routers continues to gain widespread adoption, and we plan to take share in routing.","In switching, we are continuing to take share in the market overall, and we continue to add customers for our data center switching offerings. We introduced the smaller version of the QFabric Interconnect, the QFX3000-M, in Q3. And this contributed to the addition of over 130 net new customers in Q4 and an acceleration in full fabric deployments. We continue to enhance the features and capabilities of our data center solutions.","And finally in security, we continue to have good traction with service providers, while we have reenergized enterprise security strategy, and we are beginning to show results.  This will be a big area of focus in 2013, and Bob will share more on this topic with you.","Of course, for Juniper to generate good growth, we also need to see a healthy spending environment. We will continue to watch the macroenvironment carefully, and we think the steps we've taken to improve our execution will enable us to manage the business prudently and with agility. We continue to believe that the underlying trends driving network investment around the cloud and mobility are intact and remain strong. U.S. Tier 1 service provider spending in 2012 was healthy, and we think signs in our business point to some improved momentum in routing in 2013 from U.S. and European service providers. Enterprise continues to be challenging and difficult to predict, particularly in key sectors like federal, where the U.S. budget situation has clouded visibility and continues to weigh on the sector. But bigger picture, we are steadily improving our position in the data center, and we are making important strides toward restoring growth in security. We believe the long-term demand for high-performance networking continues to be positive as mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets proliferate and service providers increasingly rely on high-performance networks to support the demand for data.","Wrapping up, we generated solid financial results in 2012 in a challenging macroenvironment. We focused on those things that we could control, and in the process, we strengthened our product offerings, improved our execution and allocated our capital thoughtfully. Looking ahead, Juniper is entering 2013 in a strong position with good opportunities to take share in routing and switching, and we expect to continue to make progress in security. We will play offense as we pursue our 3-year financial targets, and we will do this by staying true to our strategy, delivering great products, focusing on operational excellence and managing our costs carefully.","Thanks again for joining us today, and now, I'll hand it over to Bob to share more details on software-defined networks and our activities in security. Bob?","Robert L. Muglia","Thank you, Kevin, and it's great to be joining the call with all of you today. Kevin has asked me to update you on a couple of items. The first of those is our strategy and vision for software-defined networking. We unveiled this as a part of our Global Partners Conference last week to an enthusiastic response. And today, I'll put some more context on why this announcement is important.","The second item is our progress in security. We refined our security strategy, improved our products and delivered significant new capabilities over the past year. You'll be hearing more details on what we're up to over the coming weeks at events like RSA and Mobile World Congress, and I will offer a bit of a preview today.","So let's start with our SDN announcement. I think we all appreciate that SDN is likely to represent a significant shift in networking. Yet for all the hype, the industry conversation has been pretty narrowly focused. We actually view SDN as a much broader opportunity than what's been defined to date by industry players and analysts. Although we've been fairly quiet up until now, we've been working hard behind the scenes for some time. And what we articulated last week is a clear vision for the industry, as well as a pathway for our customers, service providers, enterprise and cloud providers, to begin thinking about how they will embrace SDN in their networks.","We intend to lead the shift to SDN. We started that conversation last week by defining 6 principles for SDN and providing customers with a 4-step road map, steps that will help enterprise and networks operators achieve the real promise of SDN, making their networks more agile and lowering their OpEx. We strongly believe that Juniper is ideally positioned to take this leadership role in SDN. The factors that are driving the SDN opportunity uniquely align with Juniper's strengths and track record of disruptive innovation. Our technology vision for SDN will embrace Juniper's focus on silicon systems and software. But the business model is just as important. Leveraging proven business software industry practices, we believe that the licensing model we introduced last week, Juniper Software Advantage, will deliver great value to our customers while driving incremental revenue growth for Juniper in the years ahead. So we think we're in an excellent position to succeed with our SDN strategy in business.","Depending on where you sit in networking industry, SDN can be an opportunity or a threat. For Juniper, it's an incredible opportunity. We look forward to keeping you updated.","Let's now turn to security. The SRX continues to gain traction with service providers, and we see more opportunity ahead as the international mobile market moves to LTE. We expect this to continue as SPs expand from large cell towers to small cells within shopping malls, stadiums and other high-traffic areas to provide better service and more effectively utilize their licensed spectrum. The combination of leading performance, together with well-established customer adoption, uniquely positions the SRX to capture these deployments.","We are still turning the corner on enterprise security sales, but in Q4, we made major strides with our delivery of great security products that meet the needs of enterprise customers. As we committed earlier this year, in Q4, we released the production version of our integrated security management product, Security Director [ph]. This product has been in trial with 100-plus beta customers and has already been deployed by over 25 customers, cutting across enterprise vertical segments including financial services, healthcare and retail, as well as service providers.","In addition, over the past 6 months, we engaged in many strategic security conversations with enterprise CSOs. Mykonos, Juniper's thought leadership intrusion deception technology, has garnered both significant interest, as well as new sales in the enterprise, and has provided us with a vehicle to discuss our overall security portfolio. At the upcoming RSA event in San Francisco, you'll be hearing more about our new security product offerings. We will also have some exciting news to share at Mobile World Congress around our security offerings in the 4G LTE environment.","We're pretty excited about what's on tap at security in 2013. We've accomplished a lot in the past year from stabilizing the business to charting a strategy for resumed growth and now, the fun stuff, executing on that strategy and showing customers what we can do. As we've said many times, security is a growth market, and for Juniper, it's a core area. Despite our recent challenges, we have a double-digit share of this market. We are committed to growing that share and we are putting the pieces in place to do just that. And now, here's Robyn.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. In the fourth quarter, Juniper improved operational execution and delivered good results. I'm pleased with our quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth and our operating margin expansion. Looking at the year overall, in a challenging macro and market environment, we continued to make progress in 3 main areas: first, operational excellence, where we aligned our cost structure to sharpen our focus, enable agility and drive efficiencies; second, focus on innovation, where we strengthened our portfolio with disruptive new products and key enhancements to existing products, especially in the enterprise security and data center; and third, prudent capital allocation, where we are adding complementary technology through acquisition and increased our share buybacks. We have largely completed our announced headcount action. We've also made significant progress on the facility and other action. These are all intended to bring our cost structure more in line with our long-term model.","As expected, these restructuring-related actions resulted in pretax charges for the fourth quarter of $11 million associated with severance, facilities and other restructuring costs. We also completed the acquisition of Contrail Systems for a total of $176 million of cash and equity. The total net cash outlay was $49 million, and the remainder of the consideration was in the form of equity awards.","Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, book to bill remained greater than 1. Product backlog increased sequentially for the third quarter in a row, reaching $410 million, up 17% sequentially and 37% from a year ago. As anticipated, product deferred revenue decreased sequentially and increased year-over-year. The sequential decrease was due to delivery of certain software features in the quarter. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,141,000,000, an increase of 2% both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential increase was due primarily to growth in Americas service provider revenues and modest improvement in EMEA. The year-over-year increase is due to growth in U.S. service providers.","Revenue for the full year was $4,365,000,000, down 2% year-over-year. During 2012, we strengthened our product portfolio with the rollout of new products and product enhancements. We also had good year-over-year growth in existing products. Compared to 2011, SRX grew 17%, EX grew 8% and MX grew 7%. Verizon accounted for over 10% of Juniper's total revenue, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Verizon continues to be a strategic customer and deploys many of our routing, switching and security products across both their wired and wireless networks.","For the fourth quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19. This includes the impact of the restructuring charges I noted earlier, which totaled $0.02 per share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.28, up $0.06 sequentially and flat with the fourth quarter of last year. The sequential increase reflected the combination of revenue growth, good gross margins and lower operating expenses.","For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.35 compared to $0.79 for the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.85 versus $1.19 a year ago.","Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. Americas revenue was up 8% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year increase was due to U.S. service provider growth. This was partially offset by a decrease in U.S. enterprise as a result of weakness in federal. EMEA revenue was up 5% sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. While EMEA remains challenged, we continue to see modest improvement in the demand environment, particularly in Western and Southern Europe. APAC revenue was down 18% sequentially due to a significant decline in China service provider.","Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems division revenue for the fourth quarter was $930 million, up 4% both sequentially and year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $514 million, up 5% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by record revenue for MX and good growth in PTX. Year-over-year, we saw significant growth in the MX product family driven by U.S. service provider and the Edge. This growth more than offset the anticipated decline in older M and E Series products. We will continue to closely manage our supply chain in response to increasing service provider Edge routing demand.","Total router product revenue, including both PSD and SSD, increased 3% sequentially to $531 million. Total switching product revenue was $146 million, flat sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. It's important to note that orders grew 19% sequentially, and given the timing of these orders, we ended the quarter with a strong backlog. SSD revenue in the fourth quarter was $211 million, down 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $170 million, down 4% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. The 8% year-over-year reduction in total security product revenue reflects the continued decline in our ScreenOS enterprise firewall business. And as Bob outlined, we have been taking steps to address this with enhanced functionality and management features.","Consistent with the trend we have seen over the last year, service provider accounts for approximately 35% of our total security product revenue. High-end SRX product revenue declined 19%. We expect revenue for this product to continue to fluctuate based on the timing of service provider deployments. Branch SRX was up 17% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, demonstrating the early signs of progress we are seeing with our enterprise customers.","I'd also like to provide some insight into demand for our new products. At SAM, we said we expected the combined revenue from ACX, QFabric, PTX, T4000 and MobileNext, that we would exit the fourth quarter of 2013 with a quarterly revenue run rate of $150 million. We have seen healthy bookings for the new products, and we believe that we are on track to achieve this level of revenue. For Q4 2012, we are pleased with our progress. The combined bookings in these 5 products are approximately 50% of our total 2013 year-end goal.","Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was $740 million, up 5% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year increases were attributable to broad strength in Americas service provider, where we've seen good breadth of demand across all verticals, carriers, both wireless and wireline, cable and content service providers. We've also benefited from modest improvement in demand in EMEA. Enterprise revenue was $401 million, down 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflects weakness in the Americas, primarily federal, which was offset by an increase in EMEA. The year-over-year decrease was also attributable to America's enterprise, with both federal and financial services declining compared to a strong Q4 2011. Our enterprise business in APAC has performed well this year. For 2012, our total revenues in the U.S. federal area accounted for approximately 4% of full year total revenue.","Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the fourth quarter was 65.3% compared to 65.6% last quarter. This was slightly better than we expected due to favorable mix and a strong services margin performance. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 66% compared to 66.8% in the third quarter, and non-GAAP services gross margins were 63.2%, up 1 point from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were better than expected, decreasing 1% sequentially to $537 million as a result of cost reduction activities.","Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,234 employees, down 350 from the third quarter. This headcount includes the employees from the Contrail acquisition. We are pleased with our activities on the cost structure and we are committed to achieving our targeted cost reductions.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 18.2%. I'm pleased with this result, which was due to a combination of higher revenue, higher gross margins and lower operating expenses.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 26.8%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter tax rate does not reflect the renewal of the R&D tax credit, which came into effect in early 2013.","Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.8 billion of net cash and investments. Cash flow from operations was $155 million, down sequentially as a result of an increase in working capital. DSO was 35 days in the quarter. Capital expenditures and depreciation were both up slightly from the prior quarter. We repurchased 14.5 million shares for $250 million at an average price of $17.24. We have $568 million remaining on our current authorization. And we expect to continue to calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time.","As we have done in the past, we kick off the year with an updated set of operating principles, which provide insight on how we are managing the business. For 2013, our 5 principles are: We expect the macroeconomic environment to remain uncertain. We expect overall modest growth in the markets we serve. We expect to take share in routing and switching and stabilize our share in enterprise security. We expect to expand 2013 operating margins over 2012. And we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows and prudently allocate capital.","Now I will review our outlook for the first quarter. And as a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Our outlook for the March quarter reflects our expectation of a typical seasonal decline, especially in the enterprise sector. This decline is consistent with the cautious approach our customers are taking to capital deployment. In service provider, we see a continuation of U.S. service provider capital spending and some signs of improvement emerging in EMEA.","With that backdrop, for the first quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,050,000,000 to $1,070,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 64% plus or minus 0.5 point. Operating expenses are expected to be $515 million, plus or minus $5 million. We expect operating margins to range from 14% to 16%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.18 and $0.22 per share. This assumes flat share count and a tax rate of 29%, which does reflect the Q1 impact of the R&D tax credit. Given the timing of the renewal of the tax credit and its retroactive application to 2012, we expect an additional benefit to the Tier 1 tax rate of approximately $15 million. This is not reflected in the 29% rate that I just mentioned.","In summary, throughout 2012, we have focused on improved operational execution, continued innovation and prudent capital allocation. We finished the year with a good quarter. In 2013, we will navigate with the same disciplined approach, driving growth by taking share in routing and switching while stabilizing security. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and ongoing commitment to executing our strategy for driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. Now I will hand it back to the operator to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Kvaal of Barclays.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have a question, Kevin, for you and one for you, Robyn, as well. Kevin, you had spent some time during the quarter talking about the routing cycle and how you felt there was time for a recovery. Can you give us a bit of insight into how you are thinking about what that means for your 2013 growth rate? You talked about growth in your present press release as well. If you could give us some more thought behind that, that'd be wonderful.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes. Go ahead with the second question you had for Robyn, Jeff?","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. Robyn, I wanted to know on the OpEx side of things, if you could tell us, is that $515 million guidance for the March quarter, is that effectively where we should think about your OpEx plan as bringing the OpEx? Or is there another leg to go after that?","Kevin R. Johnson","Thanks for the question, Jeff. I'll take the first one then hand over to Robyn. 2012 year-to-date through Q3, the addressable -- total addressable market for routing had actually declined by about 3 percentage points. Yet at the same time, traffic continues to grow. And we had a service provider customer event in early December and just confirmed with our customers that certainly, traffic was continuing to grow through that period. And what that means then is overall, the service providers are running their networks hotter. And so it's a matter of time when they cycle through and say, \"Okay, now it's time to make new capital investments in routing infrastructure either to, a, modernize those networks or, b, add capacity to them.\" And I think based on the set of projects that we're engaged in and have been awarded, combined with the uptick we saw in Q3 on service provider routing spending, I think that's an indicator that I think we're about to enter a better cycle for routing spend, which leads to our view that we think this is an opportunity for growth in 2013. I'll remind you, it's still early and it still varies by geography, but we had a very strong quarter with our U.S. Tier 1 service providers and we've got a good base of wins in both Europe and Asia Pacific. So we'll see how things play out. But I think if history repeats itself, it looks like we're on that kind of cycle. Let me ask Rami if he wants to add anything to that as well.","Rami Rahim","Sure. Yes, I would agree with that, Kevin. If you -- in talking to many of our customers throughout the quarter, I would say that a lot of the usual trends that we've been seeing are going to start to impact them in 2013 around just dealing with capacity, the results from video traffic, as well as convergence. I mean our operators are looking for ways to simplify their networks, to collapse networks and just reduce the OpEx of running those networks. And I do think that some of those investment cycles that Kevin talked about throughout 2013 are going to play out.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, and just let me talk about OpEx. So as I guided in the prepared remarks, OpEx is $515 million plus or minus $5 million for the Q1 period of time. I want to remind you that Q1 is where we see an increase typically in OpEx around FICO and variable compensation for employees. I also said in my prepared remarks that we are largely complete with our employee actions, but we are continuing in terms of facilities and the other actions that we have around cost structure. So my view is we're well on track to achieve the cost targets that we've talked about previously.","Operator","The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 questions, the first one is on switching. Switching was down, as you said, about 6.5% year-over-year, I think, and flat sequentially. But you also said that the orders were up 19%. And I'm wondering what causes in switching, what causes the orders -- and I assume it's enterprise switching. So the question is what causes in switching the orders to go into the deferred and not into recognition? Is it just timing or there is more of a long-term contract, et cetera? So that's one question. The second question is about OpEx again. And the question is how much of your announced cost cuts was already implemented in the fourth quarter, third quarter, et cetera? You gave us very good guidance before about the amount and how it falls in the -- where it falls in the P&L. And I'm wondering if you can update us on what it was done already and what's going to be done in the next few quarters.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, thanks for your questions, Tal. I'll -- Rami and I will take the first one, and we'll hand over to Robyn for the second one. On your question on switching, in the quarter, enterprise switching grew sequentially. And the place that we had bookings that we're going to ship in Q1 was on the service provider side. And the way I interpret that is when I look at the spending patterns of service providers and the orders they place, they prioritize the CapEx around shipping the routing infrastructure and placed orders for some switching that's going to ship in Q1. So actually, our enterprise switching grew and the bookings that are shipping in Q1 were service providers. So it's not unusual for service providers to place orders for routing, switching, security and book those and say, \"Okay, we want this to ship in Q1.\" And that's mainly the way that each one of them is prioritizing where they're putting their CapEx. Rami, do you want to add anything to that?","Rami Rahim","Sure. Yes, I mean that's essentially right. The service provider component of switching tends to be lumpy because it depends on fewer number of orders from fewer customers. So that's what we saw happening in Q4. The other thing that's just worthwhile reiterating is simply that we've been introducing new functionality to our QFabric product. In fact, we introduced a new version of our QFabric, which is the -- what we call the micro fabric, the smaller version which we've seen hit the sweet spot in the market. And as a result of that, we've seen an increase in the number of customers and greater adoption of that product in the switching market.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, and in terms of OpEx, Tal, I did talk about the overall targets that we have for the full year in terms of taking out OpEx. Those percentages still apply. I talked about 75%, 80% in OpEx and the rest of it in cost of goods sold. And I'll reiterate. You can see that the headcount is down net about 350 at the end of the year. That -- we did previously talk about notifying about 500 heads. So there are still some that were onboard at the end of December, so some will come out in the third quarter. But largely, the headcount action has been taken. Obviously, not all the cost savings are in there that's reflected in the $515 million guidance that I've given you for the first quarter. Things that we will see that actually will reduce OpEx as we move forward are some of the facilities and other related cost actions, some of which are in the COGS areas I've mentioned before around supply chain activities, that type of thing. But overall, we're very comfortable with actions we've taken. They're the right actions. They do help us with our agility, our focus and our state as a company, as well as taking out costs and aligning the cost structure to our long-term model.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Robyn, the -- is there a specific number how much cost cuts is left to be done?","Robyn M. Denholm","We -- I haven't called out that number in terms of what's left to be done. You can see by the guidance that there's a significant reduction. Typically, what we see in the first quarter is an increase in expenditure to do with variable comp and the FICO, et cetera. So you can expect some additional decline from the 15 -- $515 million number.","Operator","Our next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Morgan Stanley.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all, Robyn, thanks for that switching order number, 19%. Can you give us a sense as to what the routing orders looked like in the quarter to give us some kind of handle on what that looked like? And I think, Kevin, you talked -- you spoke about, I think 130 or 133. I didn't -- must not have got it correctly wrote down, new customers in Q4. I believe that was for, you said, data center switching. But if you can say that again or clarify, if that, in fact, was QFabric or that was all of switching. And how that compares to last quarter, when I don't think we had a number for that. Then I have a follow-up on tax rate.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, I'll take the second question and hand over to Robyn. What I said, Ehud, was we had over 130 net new QFabric customers in Q4. And that was a result of, I think in many ways, the release or introduction of the micro fabric. And Robyn, you want to take the other question?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. So in terms of...","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Kevin, can I just ask -- clarify that? Is that for the top-of-rack the way it used to be in previous quarters or were those -- some of those taking the full solutions?","Kevin R. Johnson","Absolutely, they're taking the full solution. We also had -- I commented that we had over 130 net new incremental QFabric customers and a wave of full fabric deployments. So certainly, a portion of those were -- all of the lease were known customers and there's a wave of full fabric deployments as well.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","How many does that give us in total? Because you used to give a cumulative total.","Kevin R. Johnson","I don't have that number, Ehud. I -- we just looked at it sort of once at the release that micro fabric came out, what was the impact on that. So I apologize, I don't have that number in front of me.","Robyn M. Denholm","So in terms of the backlog, as I mentioned, the backlog was up again sequentially. That's the third quarter in a row it reached $410 million for the quarter, so it's up nicely at 17% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. And clearly, in any quarter, a significant proportion of our backlog is always routing. So we were happy with the bookings in the quarter. As Rami mentioned before, we talked about a very good MX quarter in terms of revenue. There are deployments happening on the Edge, and that's a good indicator for us in terms of the demand environment.","Operator","Our next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. I wanted to ask about PSD and SSD's contribution margins. Sequentially, PSD up quite a bit and then SSD down. I'm particularly interested in maybe getting more color on the PSD contribution margins, your trajectory. I think, Robyn, you said that MX and PTX were big contributors to the growth in there. Can you just talk to us a little bit about was it mostly MX driving the margin better? Or did -- if PTX maybe a little bit more than -- better margin, a lot of it's expected? And then I was curious, Robyn, why you guys didn't mention the T4000. So I just wondered if you could give a little update on what the latest status on T4000 refresh is.","Robyn M. Denholm","So in terms of the overall margin, Rod, let me talk about that. And then I'll let Rami talk about the T4000. So in terms of PSD margin and SSD, clearly, volume has a big amount to play with those overall contribution margins. We saw a surge in revenue as you saw from the numbers in terms of PSD, given that routing is up, et cetera. And obviously, with the high-end SRX decline quarter-over-quarter, which we were expecting because of the service provider deployment, that actually weighs on the overall revenue being down for SSD, and therefore, the contribution margin. So if I up-level the discussion, you talked about gross margins, the gross margins in the quarter were healthy. They were actually better than we expected, and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks. That was primarily the result of 2 factors. One was mix was better. We did see a good uptick in MX in the quarter. And then the second factor was the services gross margin. That was actually a very good gross margin for them given their execution in the quarter, and also the result of some of the cost reductions that we've been focused on in that area. So the 2 factors combined increased the gross margin from our guidance for the fourth quarter.","Rami Rahim","I can weigh in a bit on the T4000 question. We definitely saw in Q4 that there was a bias of investment by service providers towards the Edge. And this is -- if you look at the investment drivers in the Edge in the quarter, they differ somewhat. In the quarter, it's really all about capacity. So operators will tend to defer investment until they actually hit the capacity constraint. In the Edge, it's about capacity, but it's also about just connectivity, it's also about services. What we saw in Q4 that the Edge drivers were much stronger than the core driver. And for that reason, there was, in fact, a decline in T4000 upgrades overall. Now if you'll look out into 2013, we expect that because of the fact that networks are running hotter, and eventually, the constraint or the bottlenecks in the network will start to move from Edge to core, that will start to be a driver for upgrades in T4000 and also a driver for adoption of the PTX as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Considering the T4000 is probably the company's highest gross margin product family out there and you're guiding margins in March to be down about 130 basis points sequentially to 64%. Would that -- I guess that would imply that you still don't expect the T4K line cards to be deployed en masse in the March quarter? I guess that's question number one. And then second question is with respect to pre-configured systems gaining traction out there in the marketplace, and obviously, Juniper has a partnership with IBM Secure [ph], can you talk a little bit about how this is developing? And is this a focus for you? And are there, perhaps, other opportunities out there for the company to pursue from a partnership perspective?","Robyn M. Denholm","Okay. Thanks, Brian. I'll talk about gross margins. So in terms of the absolute gross margins between T and MX and routing, in particular, versus switching and security, go back to the SAM slide that I put on gross margins. We made good margins on routing and security. Obviously, switching is slightly lower, QFabric is higher. So it's not a reflection of our expected demand for T4000. We obviously, when I was talking about switching, I gave you the bookings mix versus the revenue mix. So the book, they obviously -- the overall mix of switching in the quarter for Q4 was lower than we've seen. So that had a positive impact, if you like, to mix in terms of the gross margin factors. But overall, the gross margins are healthy. We're happy with where we are in terms of our long-term model range. Obviously, we called that range out in June as well at 63% to 66%, and 2 quarters in a row, different factors, but we're in that 65% range, which we're comfortable with. In the next quarter, volume clearly plays a role in our gross margin. So given the revenues down quarter-over-quarter, you would expect to have an impact on the gross margins just related to that volume drop quarter-over-quarter.","Robert L. Muglia","And, Brian, the second question you asked was related to our partnership with IBM and some work we've done with IBM and a distribution partner, Arrow, that we both work with. Fundamentally, IBM has put together the PureFlex Systems, and we've worked with Arrow and IBM to now integrate QFabric nodes in the top-of-rack of those integrated systems. And that allows the systems to operate in a standard 2-tier Ethernet mode or in a QFabric mode. And we've gone through the testing and certification to make sure that we've got a fantastic solution for customers who look to have a fully integrated solution. I think that was announced last week in our Global Partner Conference. I mentioned, too, we continue to work very closely with a number of partners in the industry. I think we also announced in 2012, the second half of 2012, completing the interoperability testing with EMC and the EMC storage in QFabric. And so these are just examples of use cases and scenarios where we've been working with partners and we're pleased. It's early days with the IBM, Arrow work that we just announced last week, but we do feel good about the fact we've got a reconfigured, tested, certified solution from both IBM and Juniper that we can stand behind with our customers who want a fully integrated stack.","Operator","Our next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a clarification first for Robyn and then a question. When you commented, Robyn, that in the current deferred revenue decline, most of that was due to the recognition of some large software piece of revenue, can you just clarify which segment that was recognized in? Was it in routing or switching or security? And then when you highlighted a couple of the areas of weakness in Q4, namely one in a large China service provider and then also in the federal segment, for each of those, can you just comment on whether you expect those to come back either in the first quarter or in the full year 2013?","Robyn M. Denholm","So, Simona, in terms of the deferred revenue, it wasn't software that we recognized, it was actually systems. So it was in the PSD area, largely in routing. And that's -- the features that we're talking about were releases of Junos with the features that caused the deferral in the first place, if you like, in terms of commitments on those features. So thank you for the clarification. It was the systems revenue that actually the deferral came from.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, and on the second part of your question, Simona, let me address it. I think as Robyn mentioned, a large service provider in China, we had a big project that completed in Q3, and so that created a comparable from Q3, and we continue to drive opportunities in China. And service provider spending will be lumpy as it is in other customers as they start, stop projects, but the service provider sector overall, we think the trend of a more prude spending cycle will continue to unfold. In U.S. federal segment, I think that -- as U.S. federal has been a customer set that's been down in 2012, and certainly, was down in Q4. And given the situation that our U.S. government is dealing with whether it's the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling, the budget, I don't anticipate that becoming more clear anytime soon. But we will all see.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Dennean of Citigroup.","Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You clearly sound better on the service provider outlook, and you mentioned that you have plans to take share in routing in 2013. Can you discuss a little bit where you think the opportunity to take share in routing is? Is it core? Is it Edge? Is it the PTX ramping? And also maybe where you see the biggest opportunities to do that in terms of geographies.","Kevin R. Johnson","Let me just -- I'll just kick it off, but I'll let Rami add to this. I think if you just look at the Infonetics share data on routing, Q1 of 2012 was a bottom point. And sequentially, since Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've gained very modest amount of share, but we've been gaining share slightly. We'll see what the numbers play out for Q4. And Rami, I'll let you kind of share your perspective on the product side and the different areas of network that we feel we've got good strength and position to gain share.","Rami Rahim","Sure. So in routing, 2 primary areas, I would say, first is -- and both in the service provider, first in the Edge, the other one in the core. In the Edge, it's really all about execution towards our Universal Edge strategy that we have been working on for the last several years, in fact. We continually enhance the feature set of our MX product such that it delivers new and interesting offerings that satisfy our customers' requirements. So that puts it into different applications like business services, residential services and increasingly, mobile services. And as you also know in the Edge, one of the things that we did in 2012 was that we complemented our Edge offering with an end-to-end solution for mobile backhaul and Universal Access. So all of these, I think, are going to be big drivers for us in 2013. In the core as well, I would say that we have a very rich offering right now with the PTX sort of as a disruptive play for transport. T Series has a really nice investment protection play to increase the capacity of existing T Series deployments especially. And also the introduction of the MX 2020 that we are, this quarter, that will essentially give us a bit of a different approach of an all-out services approach for Edge, core and aggregation. So I think we've got a really rich set of offerings in the core as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Robyn, I wanted to dig a little bit into the switching again. Can you tell us a little bit more color on the revenue in the quarter, splitting it between QFabric, the EX and your WiFi business? And the second question regarding the order figure, I just want to make sure that we're looking at this on an apples-to-apples basis. Clearly, you have a book to bill in this segment above 1, but can you tell us what was it from -- in the third quarter? I'm just trying to understand whether this 19% quarter-over-quarter is off a low number from the third quarter or off of solid strong number in the third as well.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. Thank you, Ittai. So in terms of the second question around the order patterns and that type of things, I called out the orders for switching because obviously, that was a different pattern to revenue, so I always want to give you insight into where those patterns are different. So in the fourth quarter, we did see strong orders as I mentioned before. In terms of the third quarter, there was nothing unusual about the third quarter, otherwise I would have called that out. And so our view is it is an important data point for you to have in terms of the bookings versus the revenue in the quarter. And as we've mentioned earlier in response to another question, it is different -- was different by enterprise versus service provider. We saw good sequential increase in enterprise revenue. So that is on that question. In terms of the split between the different product families within switching, we have not broken that out on the call and it's not the right time for us to do that. At some point in the future, we may do that, but not today.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If we look at the full year and consider the likelihood of a reacceleration in revenue growth on the second half, what would they -- would that mostly be market recovery of switching and routing? Or which state would be a better uptake of some of the new products and also the new SRX products? Can you just -- and your thoughts maybe on what Juniper might do to stimulate demand? And then separately, reading into your comments on capital allocations -- for capital allocation, it sounds like you're so close to announcing a dividend. Maybe if you can highlight your comfort with future cash flows.","Kevin R. Johnson","Well, I'll let you take the second one, Robyn. Thanks for your questions, Mark. Go ahead, Robyn.","Robyn M. Denholm","So, Mark, in terms of the dividend, we're not announcing a dividend. We would tell you if we were announcing a dividend. We're not doing that at some point. Obviously, our cash flows are strong, and we've had opportunistic repurchases over the last few quarters to bring the share count down and also obviously return capital to shareholders at the right time. So our point of view in terms of -- we have a prudent capital allocation strategy that balances our growth agenda, both organic and inorganic. And our M&A strategy has not changed. We'll continue to do technology tuck-ins over time, and then also our repurchase program. So the 3 things are our capital allocation program.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, and your first question, Mark, I think I would sort of highlight 4 things that I think are important and relevant in the question of how we stimulate demand, how we go about creating opportunities for us to grow share in a market that on the service provider side, should be improving throughout the year. The first is we've got to start with great products. And I think when we look at our routing portfolio, I think we feel like not only have we introduced great new products, but we've enhanced our existing product set, enhanced them with new features that Rami made, and fundamentally, we've improved quality of those products as well. So I think when we look at everything from what we're doing in core routing to Edge routing to the access and aggregation layers of routing, we feel like we've got a very, very compelling portfolio and one that is just stronger today than it was a year ago. And you look then across our switching fabric portfolio and with continued focus on that, we continue to see growth opportunities, and certainly in the areas of security, we have a very strong service provider security business. And we've acknowledged there were some gaps, competitive gaps in our enterprise security portfolio that we've been closing. So I think in all dimensions of the product setting, we've strengthened our product sets. So it's got to start with great products. Number two, we look at our key accounts, our largest customers. We've really focused on how we execute well and deepening those relationships with those key accounts. And that's where the work that we've been doing to win a number of these projects and really align the value that we're bringing to those accounts with the strategy that they're on. We think we've deepened those relationships, and it's been shown in our customer satisfaction surveys. We just finished our customer sat survey at the end of 2012, and overall satisfaction with Juniper is up; overall satisfaction with the quality of account management, up; product quality, up; service and support, up. So we've really engaged in a deeper way, and we're seeing good results from that. The third then is our partners. We just hosted our Global Partner Conference last week in Las Vegas. We has over 1,000 people live at the event and over 2,000 attending via webcast, and continuing to educate and arm our partners with the information they need to go grow their business and do it based on Juniper technology. I think we had a very, very, very good event and a lot of very positive energy there. And so when I look at it, those are kind of 3 examples of things that we're very focused on, and all those things come down to excellence and execution and how we're focused on both the innovation agenda and the go-to-market agenda and just executing better. And that's going to help us.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you. That is all the time we have for the call today. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us. And your IR team is hosting several events during the quarter, including one at Mobile World Congress. We hope you'll be able to join us via webcast and we'll be sending out details soon.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may begin.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Here on the call are Shaygan Kheradpir, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer; and Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Juniper Development and Innovation.","Please remember when listening to today\u2019s call that statements concerning Juniper\u2019s business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally, or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, and spending by communication service providers and major customers, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, rapid technological and market change, litigation, the potential impact of activities related to the execution of Juniper\u2019s integrated operating plan, and other factors listed in our most recent 10-K and the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today.","All statements made during this call are made only as of today.

For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. We\u2019ve extended today\u2019s call to an hour and a half in order to accommodate more questions.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Shaygan.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thank you, Kathleen, and welcome to all of you who are joining us on today\u2019s conference call and webcast. I joined this iconic company, because I saw a unique opportunity to optimize the organizational\u2019s phenomenal assets, deep customer relationships, great technology, and fantastic people to address our customers\u2019 most pressing needs, high performance, agile, secure, automated, context-aware networks all delivered in an open framework.","It is also my belief that we can deliver improved results for our shareholders by working in a more efficient structure with greater customer connectedness and accountability for performance. These are the areas I\u2019m going to cover with you today.","First, a review of our quarterly results, and second, an update on our IOP and the steps we\u2019ve taken to achieve our stated target of $160 million in annualized OpEx savings.","Our quarterly financial results demonstrate that we are on our way. On a year-over-year basis, we delivered 10% revenue growth and expanded our non-GAAP earnings per share by 21%. And we achieved this while creating our integrated operating plan and kick starting an execution.","In addition, today AT&T announced that Juniper has been selected as a strategic vendor to help deliver their Domain 2.0 vision to deploy a User-Defined Network Cloud. This is an honor for our company and one I know we are all very proud of. I want to recognize our team that collaborated so well across the company in support of AT&T.","Clearly, this is an exciting and important time for us as a company and I am thrilled to be on this journey with my colleagues around the world. I am pleased with our Q1 2014 results, which reflect continued momentum in the business. Importantly, our revenue was well-diversified. We saw continue demand from our service providers across Web 2.0, cable and carriers in all geographies, as well as from the Americas Enterprise customers, reflecting significant opportunity to capture share in the meaningful, high-growth segments our Cloud-Builder and High IQ networking across the globe.","Robyn will give you more color on the quarter in a moment, but before she does so, let me share with you the progress we\u2019re making related to IOP. I am very impressed with the thoughtful and disciplined approach the team has taken to ensure the success of our IOP. We have already demonstrated our ability to execute quickly as one unified organization, or what we call one Juniper. I want to thank all of my colleagues around the world who have been responsible for implementing this plan and delivering the outstanding results this quarter.","So, here is an update on our progress across the four dimensions of IOP. First, we have sharpened our strategic focus on the highest growth opportunities in the networking as customers migrate to best-in-class cloud environments and High IQ networks. The demand for highly scaled, sophisticated, secure, automated, context-aware networks and cloud environments requires the ensemble of agent core routing, switching, security, virtualization capabilities and network intelligence and control all working seamlessly together in an open framework. That is the value proposition that Juniper alone can offer.","This strategy is focused on the continued diversification of our revenue with a deeper focus on a set of targeted customer segments that are in the build cycle for High IQ networks and cloud environments. We see four clear customer segments that fall into this category, carriers, cable, and content providers, where the network experience is fundamental to their business.","Web 2.0 companies who are also at the forefront of building advanced, secure, intelligent networks. A set of enterprise customers like financial services and national governments, who are building large-scale internal clouds, and other enterprise customers who view the network as mission-critical to their business. This strategy is clearly resonating with our customers. In addition to today\u2019s announcement with AT&T, we have secured a very important design win with a major global financial services company in transforming their network for best-in-class, cloud builder, and high IQ attributes.","Second, we have implemented a One-Juniper structure to create a more focused, connected, agile, and execution-oriented company centered around the fastest growing opportunities in the marketplace, where we see the market evolving too, and equally as important where we excel as an innovation driven company. So let me tell you what we\u2019ve done to execute towards the One-Juniper initiative.","On the go-to-market side, we have evolved our model to one that is focused on targeted industry verticals. This is the next stage in our evolution from a geography and sector-based model. We have consolidated our advanced technology teams with a focus on being true centers of excellence around cloud building and high IQ networks.","We are becoming more deliberately focused on a key set of partners who deliver these solutions and see them playing an important role in furthering our commercial business going forward. This structure allows us to be more connected to our customers than ever before to ensure we anticipate and co-create with them to meet their ever-changing needs driven by their highly dynamic end markets. I think of this as an outside-in customer imperative fused with Juniper\u2019s inside out approach to innovation.","On the R&D side of the house, you will hear more from Rami shortly about the new consolidated organization positioned to capitalize on Juniper\u2019s engineering expertise across routing, switching, and security, tightly linked with our CT organization. This new consolidated R&D structure will optimize our engineering resources across product lines and leverage our products in a more holistic and differentiated fashion.","Third, we are on schedule to eliminate $160 million in annualized structural costs from our operations with a clear glide path from second quarter 2014 to first quarter 2015. We have a detailed execution plan within each category of delayering, automation, and focused innovation that matters. These efficiencies will strengthen the company by focusing our resources on high growth areas of the market. Importantly, we have a governance model in place to ensure complete accountability.","Our newly formed cost innovation board reporting directly to me meets regularly to ensure we stay on track with execution. We continue to work with an independent consultant to provide outside expertise as needed. And our entire leadership team is unified and fully committed to appropriately managing our cost structure. Robyn will cover our cost actions in more detail during her remarks.","Fourth, in February, we introduced a new capital allocation program, which preserves flexibility for future growth while returning capital to our stockholders via buybacks and dividends. Robyn will review the progress we\u2019ve made on this program during her remarks as well.","In summary, I\u2019m very confident in our integrated operating plan. The granularity of the execution plan and the level of oversight give us the confidence to achieve the goals we committed to in our IOP. Our strategy is the right one centered on meeting our customers\u2019 most pressing needs with innovation that truly matters to them.","We are committed to executing on the goals set up in February, including reducing our cost base and significantly increasing our operating margin profile to deliver profitable growth and shareholder value. In closing, this is my commitment. We will remain relentlessly focused on disciplined execution and we\u2019ll continue to update you on a regular basis.","Thank you for your time today. Now, I\u2019ll pass the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Shaygan. I would like to first share details of our new Juniper development and innovation organization or JDI, and then provide insight into the key drivers behind our first quarter results. As Shaygan discussed, a key component of the IOP is to streamline our organization and our product portfolio combining our best-of-breed products for the world-class cross-functional innovation, and solutions to solve the most challenging and most meaningful used cases for our customers.","In the first quarter, we made a serious of related organizational changes to ensure our R&D and go-to-market functions are focused on cross-functional execution attainment of JDI strategy and business plan.","This included merging Juniper\u2019s three product marketing teams into a single integrated marketing function and creating an integrated business operations team consolidating what was once two separate teams into a single team focused on driving JDI execution. These changes are consistent with our One-Juniper approach to reduce unnecessary complexity, increased clarity ownership, and improved efficiency.","In addition, this new structure focuses our R&D resources on areas of innovation that matter most to our customers and partners high IQ networks and cloud. In short, these changes will give up the opportunity to truly focused on resources and double down on value creating technologies. For example, we have identified several pre-revenue generating project and are currently transitioning those resources and investing in technologies that matter most to our customers.","Juniper remains firmly committed to our existing security, switching, and routing businesses. As Shaygan mentioned, each plays a vital role in our high IQ network and cloud builder strategy, and they areas where we excel as a company.","Now, let me shift gears and share with you some insight into the performance drivers behind the first quarter results. Routing product revenue was up 7% year-over-year driven by strong performance in MX. Our increasing focus on customers building smarter networks, capable of generating faster return on their capital investment is paying off.","Our MX Universal Edge continues to win in the market and this quarter we enabled many new customers with these capabilities. These customers include large carriers in North America, EMEA, APAC, and Latin America. This quarter, we will begin taking orders for the world\u2019s fastest rich IP line cards with the MX2020 clocking in at over a half of terabit per second. Core was down this quarter mostly as a result of the lumpiness of build-up by large operators, but I\u2019m pleased with current pipeline for core routing. Also, industry trends continue with service provider investment in Edge and Metro are outpacing that in core. Clearly, the MX is benefiting from that. We secured a number of new PTX logo wins in the past few weeks alone and that give us confidence in the future.","In Q1, we shipped the industry\u2019s highest density packet optical solutions with new Gig-E DWDM line cards for the PTX. We had a very strong quarter in switching with product revenue up 46% year-over-year, following a 36% year-over-year growth in Q4 2013.","We\u2019re helping some of the largest clouds infrastructure providers in the world and are targeting high-growth data center switching segment, including web services, financial services, and infrastructure-as-a service provider with differentiated solution, focused execution, and high responsiveness to customers.","During the first quarter, we had wins at top tier web services companies, large content providers, global banks, including a recent win with a major global financial services company and with high growth public cloud service providers. We\u2019re encouraged by early interest and the sales ramp of the recently introduced QFX5100 top-of-rack switch in both enterprise and service provider applications.","We are making good progress in our security business. While total product security revenue was down 2% year-over-year, we are seeing continued strength in our high-end SRX business with double-digit year-over-year growth as data center consolidation and clouds drive the need for performance and scale.","We remain fully committed to our security business, focusing on what matters the most of our customers and where they are spending. It\u2019s important to note that security is a critical element of, and fully aligned with our strategy and high IQ networks and cloud.","We\u2019re seeing good traction with our 100 Gig-E SRX I\/O Card launched in the fourth quarter of last year. Juniper remains the only Firewall on the market with 100 Gig-E connectivity leading to wins in large cloud environment. For example, in the quarter, we had a win at a major Web 2.0 company, whereas 100 Gig-E was a critical differentiator.","Q1 also saw the successful introduction of new innovation to embed security in the cloud with a Firefly product suite. We closed a key win in a top financial services firm on the strength of features like high availability and better operational efficiency through automation support.","So with all that said, I summarize as follows. We\u2019re a laser focused on achieving our IOP goals and have taken concrete steps to do so. The results of these changes is an optimize One-Juniper structure, which is focused, connected, more agile, and execution-oriented, driven to deliver on our customers\u2019 imperatives, and I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ve got the talent and technology in place to deliver.","At this point, I will turn it over to Robyn. Thank you.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report that our Q1 2014 results reflect good year-over-year revenue growth and significant continued earnings expansion. Revenue grew 10% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 21%. We also continue to see strong demand signals. This sets the stage for what we expect will be continued year-over-year earnings expansion.","I\u2019m very pleased with the diversity of our revenue. We saw year-over-year growth in all three geographies with good revenue growth coming from our newer target areas within both the Service Provider and Enterprise segments. We continue to see strong demand from our Web 2.0 and cable customers. The trend that we saw in 2013 has continued in the third quarter.","In the quarter, revenue growth was driven by strength in our switching and routing products and continued growth in our SRX-based security products. Before I go into detail behind the results of the quarter. I would like to review the financial impacts related to our integrated operating plan.","On April 2, we disclosed restructuring charges related to the cost-saving initiatives that we have begun under our IOP. In Q1, we booked $122 million of restructuring and other charges. We announced a head count reduction of approximately 6% and the vast majority of the affected employees have already been notified.","In Q1, the head count related restructuring charges were $28 million. Non-cash asset write-downs of $94 million included $85 million related to the cancellation of the development of the application delivery controller technology and $8 million related to inventory. As we have stated, we are committed to achieving an annualized operating expense run rate reduction of $160 million. We are making good progress towards this target. These changes are expected to be structural.","We anticipate the mix of savings to be as follows, approximately 60% related to head count savings, 20% related to program and project reductions, with the balance coming from facilities consolidation and other savings. The fiscal 2015, we expect an expense to revenue ratio of approximately 39%.","Please refer to our chart in our supplemental slide deck posted to our website of our expected quarterly operating expense path over the next four quarters. In addition to our IOP cost reduction activities, during the quarter we announced robust and comprehensive capital allocation strategy.","I\u2019d like to walk you through the actions we have taken, which highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow potential. As part of our commitment to return a minimum of $3 billion of capital to stockholders over the next three years. We initiated $1.2 billion accelerated stock repurchase program of which $900 million worth of shares were initially delivered in Q1. We also raised $350 million of debt, allowing us to fund the ASR in a way that is consistent with our liquidity policy.","Now I would like to move into a discussion with the Q1 results. Looking at our demand metrics, we begin the second quarter with a very healthy backlog. Our book-to-bill in Q1 was slightly below one, which is typical of our Q1 trends. Product bookings were healthy with a year-over-year growth rate exceeding the revenue growth rate.","Total deferred revenue was up $174 million year-over-year and $85 million sequentially. Product deferred revenue was down $14 million sequentially, due primarily to lower channel inventory.","Total revenue was $1,170 million, up 10% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The sequential decline is in line with our typical seasonal pattern. Product revenue was up 12% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. Services revenue was $294 million, up 6% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. There were no 10% customers this quarter reflecting the continued diversity of our business. For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.22. We recorded a GAAP restructuring charge of $122 million, which resulted in $0.25 impact on GAAP earnings. This was offset by a $0.33 gain from the sale of minority equity investments.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.29, up $0.05 year-over-year and down $0.14 sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven primarily by higher revenue and operating margins. In the quarter, we had a positive impact from the reduced share count of about $0.01.","Now, let me provide color on revenue by region, market, and product area. All regions reflected year-over-year revenue growth. Overall, Americas revenue was up 15% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. Americas service provider was up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As a reminder, our service provider revenue includes carrier, cable, and Web 2.0 customers.","Americas enterprise increased 22% year-over-year and declined 15% sequentially. The strong year-on-year growth was led by federal and financial services. EMEA revenue was up 2% year-over-year and down 18% sequentially. Of note, we saw strong year-on-year performance in the German and UK market.","APAC increased 9% year-over-year and decreased 16% sequentially. These results reflect service provider growth year-over-year in both Korea and Australia. Service provider revenue for the quarter was $783 million, down 5% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year with growth across all three geographies. Enterprise revenue was $387 million, down 13% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year due to broad-based strength in the Americas and public sector spending in EMEA and APAC.","Now, let me review our revenue by product area. Routing product revenue was $550 million, down 11% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. Revenue was driven by strong performance in MX, while the new MX2000 series and the MX104 continue to gain traction and experience solid growth sequentially. This growth was offset by a decline in T-series revenues, both sequentially and year-over-year.","Total switching product revenue was $192 million, up 46% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially from a record Q4 2013. This was driven by strong sales of both EX and QFabric product families. And we are pleased with demand for both areas. Total security product revenue was $134 million, down 15% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. This is due to the continued decline of the oldest ScreenOS products and non-Junos-based products now represent less than 15% of our security revenue. The SRX products grew 13% year-over-year, led by good growth in the high-end SRX.","Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 63.5% compared to 64.2% last quarter and 64.6% a year-ago. The sequential decline was largely due to a decrease in services gross margins. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 64.8%, down one-tenth of a point from last quarter and seven-tenths of a point from a year-ago.","The sequential decrease reflects anticipated lower volume, whilst the year-over-year decrease is primarily due to mix. While the pricing environment remains competitive, we remain focused on innovation and cost improvements in our supply chain. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 59.7%, down 2.2 points sequentially and down 2.4 points year-over-year.","The declines are related to high support costs and increased spares. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $542 million, about what we anticipated due to an increase in legal costs. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 17.2% reflecting a year-over-year expansion of 1.5 points due to higher revenue offset by lower gross margins.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.6% compared to 18.8% last quarter. This change is primarily due to the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit and one-time items that were reflected in the prior quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 25.3% compared to 18% in Q4. The increases is primarily due to the net gain on the sale of minority equity investments and the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit. This is partially offset by the impact of restructuring other charges.","Looking at the balance sheet, we made substantial progress on our commitment to return capital to our stockholders. During the quarter, 33.3 million shares under the ASR program were initially delivered and retired for an aggregate purchase price of $900 million. These actions reduced the average diluted share count to 497 million, down by 9 million shares sequentially.","We ended the quarter with $2.1 billion of net cash and investments. Net cash declined by approximately $1 billion sequentially, primarily due to the ASR. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow of $126 million, down sequentially due to the seasonally lower income and annual payments for incentive comp.","Onshore cash and investments represented 29% of total growth balance. In line with recent trend, DSO was 46 days and capital expenditures were $57 million in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $46 million.","Now, let\u2019s look at our outlook for Q2 of 2014. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. As demonstrated in our recent results, we are executing well and the assets we are making to drive further execution improvements are taking hold. We see underling demand in the markets we serve is healthy and we expect to continue the year-over-year expansion in earnings. For the second quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,200 million to $1,230 million. Gross margins are expected to be 64% plus or minus 0.5%.","Operating expenses are expected to be $520 million, plus or minus $5 million, and we\u2019re well positioned to deliver on our cost reduction commitments. Operating margins are expected to be a healthy 21%, plus or minus 0.5%. And this is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.36 and $0.39 per share assuming a share count of approximately $480 million. We expect a flat tax rate versus the third quarter.","As a reminder and as previously disclosed in Q2 and throughout the rest of this year, we expect to book additional restructuring charges, the majority of which will be related to facility and other asset write-downs. To summarize, we anticipate overall demand to remain healthy, and our product portfolio continues to be strong. We are very focused on executing on our integrated operating plan and continuing to drive innovation.","Now, let\u2019s open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Brian Marshall of ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group","Hi, thanks. This is Stephen Patel calling in for Brian. Could you clarify in your OpEx guidance about 20% of the cost savings coming from actions taken to programs and projects. Have those actions already been announced and how should we think about any associated revenue growth impact from those cuts?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Yes, Stephen for Brian, thanks for the question. We have a very deterministic glide path that we shared with you, and we track these \u2013 our cost saving cuts very rigorously almost on a weekly basis. We have taken a lot of the actions, it\u2019s actually front loaded, and \u2013 but the savings of these will come \u2013 the actions are taken, but the savings will come through the second quarter and the third quarter.","Most of the head count related cuts have been already taken and we\u2019ve executed those. They will come \u2013 some of them already done, some of them will take longer, because they are in regions which just takes longer to get off payroll. And let me see if Robyn, you want to say anything else on that?","Robyn Denholm","No, I think you answered the question well. Thanks, Shaygan.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ben Reitzes of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes, good afternoon. A few if I may, Could we just parse out that legal expense and what costs would have been in the quarter without it and how much is recurring? I think that will help lend visibility to your plan and credibility behind that cadence you have on the slide. And then also Shaygan, if you could just talk about the sustainability of the switching momentum, what are you really seeing there and how sustainable is it, because obviously 46%. I think that need everybody\u2019s model for the second quarter in a row. And what you see in the competitive dynamics there? Thanks a lot.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Sure, Ben. So the first question I\u2019ll ask also Robyn determine. Most of the upward pressure we saw on the first quarter was due to legal on G&A. I will ask her to parse that I suffice it to say before I pass the Robyn. And then I\u2019ll come back on the switching. Is that we are committed and we see our way clearly to the $160 million cost cuts as laid out in that charts that we have published between now and first quarter 2015, quarter-by-quarter. So for example we would be at $520 million in second quarter and $510 million in the third quarter and less than $500 million the first quarter 2015. We are quite clearly to that we\u2019ve got most of the actions front loaded and executing. So, you shouldn\u2019t worry about the 160. And in terms of the legal. I\u2019ll pass it to Robyn and then I\u2019ll come back on switching.","Robyn Denholm","Thanks, Shaygan. In terms of the legal expenses that Shaygan mentioned they were above what we were expecting for the quarter. If you look at the G&A increase quarter-over-quarter a substantial is $7 million to $8 million. And the majority of that in fact more than that increase is due to legal in the quarter. Some of which was expected and some of which wasn\u2019t as I mean in prepared remarks. If you look year-over-year in terms of OpEx, we have been making progress and that is in pre-out recently announced actions that we have been taking. So, if you look at our OpEx is a total as a percentage of revenue is about 46.3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2014 versus 48.9% for last year. So, we have been making some progress even though the legal expenses did increase more than we were anticipating in the quarter.","Shaygan Kheradpir","And if I can, thanks Robyn. I\u2019ll take the switching. Obviously, we had, we are very pleased with the switching quarter. I can tell you and I have been engaged since I have been here with a lot of conversions with the customers of what they are doing, why they are doing and specially in regard to switching. It\u2019s actually quite fascinating. It\u2019s a lot around Cloud-Builder and is putting in place our switching with our routing and security as an ensemble and our controller and Contrail into sort of many accounts.","Now, every single one of them that I have been engaged, if you\u2019re actually sophisticated implementations and each company is doing something quite interesting. And so that is also lend itself very well to Juniper\u2019s DNA on sitting with the customers and cranking. So, they love features in Cloud-Building like in service software upgrade that\u2019s a fantastic feature do you love. They love things like micro-bursting, which gives them lot of telemetry and very fine-grained levels. They love the fact that they can write get the on some switches. And on and on and on. And they like the fact that they are open, high for scale with sort of no extra package and they can do a lot of things that each of them once they are slightly differently. And the fact they work very well with MX and SRX.","And so I think that is in cloud building which is a sophisticated build and the cloud by the way is people said is both private and public, obviously you got the Web 2.0\u2019s but on private, and under carrier on the private we mentioned we just won a large global bank around these same attributes. So the engineering transfers and it is not Barclays by the way just \u2013 that the bank of somebody else that will be announced later. And in fact as we were online I just saw the AT&T issued a press release that they have selected Juniper for their domain 2.0 user defined network based on their cloud based architecture and our modern attributes in and latest technologies. So same engineering and products is working for us in Web 2.0s in cable and content, and carriers, in large enterprises like financial services and like Rami do you want to say anything else on the switching? And expectation setting?","Rami Rahim","","Yes, I think you covered most of it, I\u2019d just say that the team has been working really hard over the last year and so when we consolidated our switching organization we streamline, simplified our portfolio and we implemented as number of capabilities from fabric technologies, IQ and a number of different things that Shaygan mentioned has made our portfolio including switching, routing and security really appealing to both enterprise and service provider.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Yes, I would just say one other thing, its Rami hit as a nail on the head where the leverage engineering between routing and switching actually quite phenomenal and why customers buy in a switching it\u2019s not your grandfathers switch and security is your grandfathers, this is a new world and all the leverage engineering we are getting from Junos really giving us a leg up and of course open net derivatives since you talk about.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay great. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Citi Group. Please go ahead.","Ehud A. Gelblum \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Hey, guys thanks I appreciate it, couple of things, so answer things are somewhat specific things, you state the one you can kind of go on, but I am curious to hear, with the AT&T win, you have been talking about AT&T for a very long time a number of products. And just understanding what is difference about I mean your way of dealing with AT&T going forward. And that what as you said before, you talk about T series as AT&T as well MXs. And so just to understand I think what is, how does that change?","Shaygan you mentioned the pre-revenue projects that you are getting rid off and of course that you are trimming the cost structure, you are finding a number of these, can you give us some example beside from the right opt for the riverbed deal, where you can give us best example and that\u2019s things you have gotten out of, so we can understand this kind of put a red basket box, whatever targets around kind of understand the different areas, that you are getting about, and identify any other areas kind of that you can that you think you still might be looking toward.","And then finally Robyn again it\u2019s been at the legal thing and again, brought up last conference call and then it\u2019s brought up here again. But can we just be specific in terms of what was the actual legal amount this quarter? what we are expecting I know there was some controversies last quarter on whether its $15 million this quarter you expecting from legal. So we assume that it was $15 million plus 7 to 8 you actually spent $23 million this quarter on legal. But you expected $15 million if you are going to just give us the Q1 legal where that goes in Q2.","So we can compare, what that looks like in Q2, and just levels that us a Q4 number as well and that\u2019s a lot, but that really it\u2019s kind of set that bar as to what\u2019s the ups and downs in legal and kind of how that is falling through those three quarters, that would be, great. Thanks.","Robyn Denholm","And Ehud I think that was like 18 questions rising there but \u2026","Ehud A. Gelblum \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","It was three main topics broken down to a category part\u2026","Shaygan Kheradpir","I know, I know I am just kidding, I am just kidding yes, yes. So on AT&T as I am sure you are familiar to have this program called domain 2.0 which is called the user defined network cloud. And essentially they are pushing their network into the next phase which is around clouds and it\u2019s around a lot of attributes of the cloud. So what are those attributes they obviously, is a carrier class nature of it which you are very good at Fort Knox security which is very, very good at.","Multi tendency and in terms of the high IQ piece of it it\u2019s a lot around automation for efficiency and effectiveness in terms of virtualization and so forth and so on. Service chaining, traffic movements a lot of STN, so a lot of the attributes that you put together to create a modern cloud based architectures they have been very clear this is what they want. And they \u2013 we are very fortunate to be sort of selected for these attributes.","And we have by the way products in all of these categories and they work and they work very well each other. So and I believe, I don\u2019t know this to be a fact but I believe that would a first re-routing and a supplier announced I don\u2019t know but that\u2019s so I think we\u2019re very pleased with that. What was the other question?","Robyn Denholm","Some of the project that we might be investing from, Rami has that.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Right. So, I\u2019ll pass it on to Rami so, and he can go more but, I would just say that with high IQ looked at our product lines are very carefully through operated charge, in terms of return on investment, in terms of the match to cloud builder on high IQ our strategy, so fact that to say we are focusing on growth and we are focusing on accretive work that matters to our customers. And based on that we have \u2013 you saw decision on ADC and as far as normal course of business we do continuous mark-to-market to evaluate our products and projects. And we are transitioning our portfolio to technologies that match our strategy and on our workforce and where can get leverage engineering Rami do you want to say a few more words on that.","Rami Rahim","I\u2019ll just add that, we on an ongoing basis are always in the process of evaluating the ROI expectations the market conditions of all of our project and making decisions based on this analysis. And the IOP was really no exception to that we did take a look across the board of all of our projects and we did identify a number of pre-revenue generating projects that we will transition resources off of and to put them on projects that are more highly aligned if you will with our strategy things like STN and NFB like many of our forward thinking customers are thinking about today and on legal Robyn.","Robyn Denholm","Yes. Let me just add on the project side, the projects we evaluate with not just R&D Rami went through some of the R&D projects. We\u2019ve also evaluated other projects that we\u2019ve been doing on the infrastructure side within the company as well and some of those will, I\u2019ve seen targeted for completion or preparation if you like as well. So it\u2019s an across-the-board review of our project, across all three of the areas. So specific to legal, I\u2019m not going to give you the dollar amount, but I will point you to the G&A line that you can see in the press release and on the various filings that we\u2019ve done. And what you can see that G&A is up significantly year-over-year, it\u2019s 39% year-over-year increase, and the legal expense increase is more or less the entire increase.","So you can say that it is \u2013 has been a large amount. Having said that as Shaygan mentioned, we are committed to achieving the $160 million of cost reductions on an annualized basis exiting Q1 of next year.","Ehud A. Gelblum \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thank you. And we are co-listing all our resources around driving profitable growth and connecting report and growth. Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay. Next question Manny?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jess Lubert \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi, guys, two questions, maybe just a follow-up on your earlier switching question, but given some of the cloud momentum and big wins you mentioned on the call, do you think Q1 is a new base off of which we should see sustainable sequential growth moving forward, or would you expect some lumpiness there?","And then I was hoping you could help us better understand some of the dynamics driving the uptick in support costs and spares that impacted service margin in the period, when you think about the likely range of service margin moving forward. Should we be thinking about numbers getting back into the 61% to 63% range, we\u2019ve seen over the last few years or should we expect service margin to remain closer to current levels? Thanks.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Sure. I will pass this question. The first one is about forward momentum on cloud building. Just suffice it to say that we \u2013 we are pleased with the momentum and the pipeline of what we see. Rami, do you want to give some more color to that?","Rami Rahim","Yes, I would be happy to, thanks, Jess. So as you know, our Switching business has an enterprise component where we are selling to enterprise, IT, private cloud and data center, machine critical campus combination, as well as service provider applications, including things like cloud data center intra-POP infrastructure connectivity, certain parts of access infrastructure.","And I have said in the past that especially the service provider components of that business can be lumpy. In Q1 we actually saw strength in both enterprise and service provider. So can you expect this level of performance going forward, I would say that\u2019s probably unrealistic. Our goal is to continue to take market share and I\u2019m very confident in our ability to do so.","Shaygan Kheradpir","And, Robyn, do you want to take that.","Robyn Denholm","Yes, so in terms of the services gross margin Jess, the gross margin in the quarter was 59.7%, it has been quite some quarter since we\u2019ve been below 60%. And the reason for that as I mentioned in my prepared remarks was that the support costs were higher in the quarter and we also had increased bearing. We normally get increasing bearing when we have our new customers or new contracts or new product introduction. And so the timing of those do vary from time to time in terms of when we get those spares on board. So we do expect the services gross margin to improve from this low level of 59.7% in the quarter.","Kathleen Nemeth","Great. Next question please Manny?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeff Kvaal \u2013 Northland Capital Markets","Hi, thank you very much and happy to be back in business. Could I ask a couple of questions, one is from a high-level? There has been some talk about our core routing refresh cycle and I think talk about some of the carriers running hot. There seems to be now, your commentary was more focused on growth from the edge than the core. If you could sit some light on that I would to be delighted. And then Robyn for you, could you clarify a little bit lower products deferred revenue outlook, the channel is that driven by seasonality is that driven by a pullback from certain areas of business what goes into that reduction in the channel? Thank you.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Okay, on the first one I\u2019ll ask Rami to comment the hedge dynamic versus the core dynamics, which is obviously different. And can you just focus on the core please.","Rami Rahim","Sure, thanks Jeff. But you\u2019re right the strength we saw on routing was primarily back in the hedge and primarily driven by our MX product line. And that\u2019s essentially a play out of the strategy that we have been developing on the MX product line around the universal edge. So, in carriers and service providers are looking to consolidate their services onto fewer networks and to provide virtualization to enable business residential in video and mobile type services, we really have a fantastic weapon to compete within the form of the MX.","On the core, you\u2019re right core was in fact down, I think the biggest things that we saw in Q1 was primarily that of lumpiness in spending and in the builder. I say that because if you take a look at Q4 of last year, the core investment was actually quite okay. And then if you look at our pipeline if you will. They\u2019re again I think what you see somewhat encouraging. There is in fact also an industry trend, which we had mentioned in the past where the bulk of the investments and routing is still happening in the edge and in the metro. And that of course is putting pressure on those parts of the network the edge and the metro, which the MX benefits from and to some extent it can elevate some of the pressure from the core. So that might push out the need for investments in the core of it. The best thing that Juniper can do in a situation like this is to execute on a high leverage R&D strategy for a product that satisfied both market segments edge and core and to be ready for the cycle irrespective of where it actually start to occur.","","Jeff Kvaal \u2013 Northland Capital Markets","Thank you, Rami and Robyn you want to talk about deferred revenue question?","Robyn Denholm","Yes, Jeff in terms of the channel inventory, it is typically the case in our Q1 that there is a seasonal reduction in the inventory. But I would also so we had a strong channel quarter as well. So a strong finish all the way through to the end of the quarter through the channel. And as Shaygan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are doing a lot of business with our channel partners in terms of particularly on the enterprise, but also on the service provider area as well. And so we have a strong focus on partnering and on the channel so. And the inventory volumes will lower as we exhibit the quarter.","","Jeff Kvaal \u2013 Northland Capital Markets","Thanks.","Kathleen Nemeth","","Okay, great. Next question please.","","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead.","","Sanjiv R. Wadhwani \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","","Thanks so much. Two questions, perhaps if you look at the router outlook right now versus a year ago. I just wondering if you guys could make a comment on sort of how things stand now versus a year ago. And as far as the cost of announced in early April. Any color on where they happened and specifically what product areas where impacted that most in those cuts? Thanks.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Sure, Sandeep. So again I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll pass them to my colleagues here. So on routing, what\u2019s going on I\u2019ll give you the top-level dynamic as I see them. First of all you\u2019ve got obviously that \u2013 well everybody knows which is the bandwidth growth, which is driven really by mobile and content concentrated by video, there is pressure there. Now that actually that pressure people usually think about it in the carrier networks spread \u2013 it splashes also into data centers and clouds and also some interesting ways. So that\u2019s an end-to-end pressure and routing is very much front and center on both ends of this.","Then you\u2019ve got Rami mentioned, the second one is convergences and convergence is in two forms, one is on the access sides, that\u2019s things like P&G and then there is now finally a good move towards wireless and wireline network convergence and when that happens and you\u2019ve got the beautiful machine called MX which is right at the front center and PTX.","And then the key part of this is more and more every month that passes, we all are getting stuff as a service that is an undeniable fact and that \u2013 to do that you need to build this giant cloud systems and High IQ networks a lot of the attributes we\u2019ve been talking about and there it\u2019s much more a layer 3 discussion and as soon as you have layer 3 discussions, you land on routing, you land on routing, you land on MX, PTX and T series and all the rich, both the rich functionality on the agents, there is so many, we can\u2019t even count and then super high scale at the core. And so all of these three things we don\u2019t see that these pressures are abating relative to last year. Rami do you want to sort of give the overview on it?","Rami Rahim","The only thing I\u2019ll add Shaygan is that if I look at service provider again with that definition of web services and telco and cable then the market in fact should be a healthy market for us in this year. So it really comes down to the competitiveness of our products and our ability to actually go and satisfy the pressures that they are seeing and that\u2019s where I\u2019d just reiterate that I\u2019m actually quite confident in product and the technology that we have in the market and what\u2019s coming up in the roadmap.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Very good, so as far as the second question was around cost cuts right? Yes, so the cost cuts I would say all of them will make our company stronger going forward because they are around taking bureaucracy out, delayering the organization, the duplicating repetitive effort and as fact, so basically all of those that aren\u2019t closed about, our customers like its grade I can go directly back to back with your best people be it on go to market and engineering. Its going sort of back to way it was in a bigger fashion, so that\u2019s good.","The biggest leverage is actually amongst all it. Its not that they have put teams together for example in engineering there is all sorts of leverage work that we can get across the board in one \u2013 one are in the organization as an example. And sharpen your focus on things that matter which is on cloud building and High IQ and things frankly that we are not going to focus on either because its not really our core competency, or its not where the market is going and we\u2019re going to focus on growth. So that really their focus and the cost cuts I\u2019m certain of it, they are going to make the company stronger going forward for the following reasons.","There is a lot of work, its not only in R&D, in go to market having focused on those verticals that are in the business of cloud building, High IQ networks and where our networks are mission critical and little deepening relationship putting our entire portfolio in play, in interesting ways to take share, more valid share out of those accounts. And then be a little bit deliberate on partners much more much deliberately partnered dependent, and then the whole organization is one Juniper focused on the strategy. So the cost cuts should really be viewed in that way that they that out there \u2013 they will actually make the company stronger. Robyn, do you want to say anything?","Robyn Denholm","","No I think you\u2019ve covered a lot. Also earlier in the Q&A Rami went through that in R&D we had cut some projects like the agency that were non-revenue generating and therefore and not aligned. So there was a thorough review done in terms of both projects that would not revenue generating and also not aligned with the cloud builder in High IQ strategy, and so the teams has done a very good job on executing and spacing those types of projects as well.","Shaygan Kheradpir","","It\u2019s not accretive and it\u2019s not aligned to the strategy and its not leverage engineering, it doesn\u2019t really survive.","Kathleen Nemeth","","Okay, great. Next question please, Manny.","Operator","Thank you. The next is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","I had a couple of questions on the cost side and on the revenue side as well. So first on the cost side I think you talked about some cuts and consolidation you did in R&D operations and marketing, or there any outflow cuts to sales?","Robyn Denholn","Yes, they were Simona, there is cuts in sales and marketing as well, in fact if you look at our slide deck, we put the glide path in there from Q4 of 2013 quarterly OpEx and we\u2019ve also put a chart that shows by area, R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A. What we expect the profile of our go forward OpEx to be and again the profile from where we are coming from which is the Q4 2013 numbers versus the Q1 2015 estimates that we have in terms of the post IOP, post 116 reduction on an annualized basis. And so there are cuts across the board, G&A, R&D, and sales and marketing.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Yes. Of course in G&A Simona there is operation. Robyn side exactly right on the sales front, we really are focusing both on service provider and enterprise those segments that we mentioned. We are gathering our forces around those segments, so they can go deeper and more focused and frankly all those customers sets they want the same things that, for example in AT&T and Verizons which is depth and with a lot of technical hands on skills.","And so that\u2019s really the sales motion and getting that focus will also gives us synergies which is in another way of what Rami is doing win, he is doing go to market, Rami is doing good to get the leverage on engineering and making sure we\u2019re focused on cloud building and high IQ network. So you should think of it more as a focus on debt and leverage rather than, sort of cuts that weaken you.","Kathleen Nemeth","And Simona, do you have a follow-up question as well. Manny, can you open the line again for Simona, I believe Simona had a follow-up.","Operator","Sorry, and just one moment.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you.","Simona Jankowski \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, thank you very much. Yes, I did have a follow-up question on the revenue side, so you talked about de-emphasizing or cutting some of the resources for three revenue project, does that imply that you are still focusing on some early revenue projects like Junos Pulse, the wireless LAN business, and the access business.","And really the bigger picture question here I\u2019m trying to get to is, you\u2019ve given us a lot of hopeful detail on the cost saving side, but as we tried to think about what is the sustainable revenue growth profile for Juniper now with this set of businesses in the next two to three years, how should we think about that and part of the missing piece is that we don\u2019t really know if you\u2019re still pursuing some of the enterprise edge on access kind of businesses that I just mentioned?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Yes, Simona, this is Shaygan again. I would just summarize that we are not providing competitive information on this call. So that sort of point number one, we are not drilling into that zone. On the cuts, the cuts are structural, they will remain with us. And in fact, this is a muscle that the organization is building, which is good, we can always get more efficient all the time and we will leave it at that. And when we have more news about anything in terms of products, we will share with you. But right now suffice it to say, we\u2019re focused on Cloud Builder and High IQ. And, Rami, do you want to say anything else there?","Rami Rahim","No, I think that summarizes it. I will just \u2013 I just want to reiterate what I 100% committed towards switching or routing and our security businesses. I think we got a great team, great technology, fantastic roadmap, and now one that is very highly aligned with our forward looking strategy with Cloud Builder and High IQ.","Robyn Denholm","Yes, and I just want to remind you as well that, the integrated operating plan is about also focusing on the top line revenue growth. It\u2019s not just about cost reductions. We\u2019re talking a lot about cost reductions today, because it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve unveiled our glide path and the detail of the cost reductions. But what \u2013 we\u2019re about is actually growing and expanding our operating margins and our earnings over time. And we know that to do that we have to invest in the right innovations and the right market that really our customers need and want. And that will actually ultimately drive our revenue growth as well, which we\u2019ve been doing very well over the last six quarters or so in terms of revenue growth.","Kathleen Nemeth","Great. Thank you. Manny, next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mark McKecknie of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Mark McKecknie \u2013 Evercore Partners","Great, thanks. Hi, Shaygan and crew, I appreciate you get me in here. So a couple of questions, one, last quarter your router orders were pretty strong up 20% quarter-on-quarter, 30% year-on-year. So looking at the near-term and the context of your guidance, it looks like about 5% sequential at the midpoint, and we heard a lot of comments on the Switching business, would you expect a little bit of growth next quarter, quarter-on-quarter for routers, what type of margin impact that might have on the mix?","And then the second question is on the AT&T award, first off congratulations on that, but I wanted to know, who you competed against their. It sound like this is more for sort of public cloud business as opposed to some of the NFP. I want to understand that and I\u2019m assuming this is QFabric in some of your Contrail on a controller. But on that front, are you going to work with someone else\u2019s controller VMware someone else or is this a full QFabric and Contrail type solution? Thanks","Shaygan Kheradpir","","Sure, first thanks for congratulating us on the AT&T. We are all very excited about that. And by the way, on the AT&T question you should reach after them about that this scope of it. Suffice it to say it\u2019s a material and it\u2019s really that Domain 2.0 kind of work that they\u2019ve been talking about. As far as routing is concerned, the pipeline, the design wins and the backlog, they are all pleased with those numbers for routing. And as both Rami and Robyn was said there is a different dynamics between edge and the core and the lumpiness of the core and they are out in the first quarter and all the activity around hedge that is happening under first quarter. But the pipeline we are pleased both from pipeline and design wins and the backlog on routing anything else Rami you want to add that.","Robyn Denholm","I\u2019ll just add for Rami, don\u2019t forget that last year in Q2. We had a sizable amount of our enterprise routing with the government customers. So just there in mind with that when you look at our result. Having said that, we are very pleased with the strength of routing particularly in the service provider space in terms of pipeline and design wins that we have as Shaygan mentioned. So, we are actually expecting Q2 on the service provider side to improve in terms of routing in the second quarter.","","Shaygan Kheradpir","I would just agree with that. I would say I\u2019d expect continue to strength in our edge portfolio and keep in mind that we are continually enhancing these product offering itself that we are starting to take orders now for new line cards that\u2019s going to give us a real good performance increase in addition to new software capabilities. On enterprise routing was actually good for us in Q1 and I see a good pipeline there.","And then finally I provided some commentary on the core, the pipeline for the core coupled with some wins that we\u2019ve had recently in our PTX, in fact it\u2019s our brand new logo for us. Are going to start to pay off now is that going to happen this quarter or the next quarter is difficult to say usually there is a certification cycle that takes a good couple of quarters, maybe even three quarters to play out. But based on all of that, all of the above I said have pretty good confidence in Q2.","Mark McKecknie \u2013 Evercore Partners","Gotcha, thanks. Shaygan nothing on the competitive front for this AT&T, when I guess will find out?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Yeah, I mean, I should really situate \u2013 I don\u2019t have average ability like that all I can say is the engagement with them has been fantastic and very forward looking across the board all the things. There was a question I think also about Contrail and I don\u2019t want to talk about anyone specific customer, but I will say that network function virtualization is a very hot topic today as many of you already know. We\u2019re engaging with the number of our customers on that topic and showing them proof-of-concepts of technology that we have that essentially couple.","Our high performance services on the edge, on the MX, for example, along with the layer 4 to layer 7 service is that virtualize on general-purpose processors. Now that solution has to be nicely coupled together and provided in a way provide seamless service experience across both physical and virtual and Contrail plays a fundamental role in that. So Contrail now in fact over just a past short period of time has gone into life deployments and we have gone to probably around 2 to 3 dozen engagements and live trials with some customers around the world.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay, great. Next question please Manny.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Hi, thank you ask couple of quick questions on your security segment. This is a segment that has been quite volatile although we are seeing year-over-year trends improve. I was wondering if this is a segment that you actually believe can grow in 2014, particularly when we are hearing greater competitive pressure from companies like a F5, particularly in the service provider community. And I also wondered on Shaygan do you requiring incremental investments in this part of the business and can you support that given all the OpEx rationalization that you\u2019re doing?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Yes, thank you for the question. So, I\u2019ll go through it. The quick version of the answer is that yes, we expect our security to grow year-over-year, now what I have to tell you is securities are paramount importance to our strategy, because you can\u2019t really as I said have a cloud be a Cloud Builder and not have security. In fact, it\u2019s much more important than before. We are pleased with our performance and growth in our SRX and Firewall both in enterprise as well as on service provider, we have as you know decline in our ScreenOS, the declines are \u2013 we had 6 ScreenOS flagship design, it was 20% of the base in that 15%, so that\u2019s diminishing.","As you said correctly it is, I would believe it is stabilizing it is too be minus 18%, minus 7%, minus 2% year-over-year and we expected to return to growth by the end of this year. Having said all that we are not satisfied of where we are and we need to execute better, we acknowledge that and now that we have security in, are coming R&D team. I think we are going to get a much better leverage engineering and with everything else we have. And as you well know security market is changing, security is moving into the core, cloud, security is virtualizing everywhere else.","Security is in desperate needs of high analytics. Because when you have a cloud and High IQ networking have a lot of valuable assets in it. And so having analytics to defend especially against things like military spider attack is very important. And of course you have to and need to have high efficacy. And we have a lot of capabilities, now we have to execute better they all under one R&D organization and that\u2019s our focus is to return back to year-over-year growth. Rami, do you want to say anything else on that?","","Rami Rahim","I will just add, we saw a great growth in the high end, that direct double digit growth and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accident that the result of a lot of really hard work had gone into improving the session scale, the performance, the efficacy of that solution something that we are proud of and I think we demonstrated what we can do, when we focused on the rest of the portfolio and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re in the process of doing right now. And it\u2019s going on the last thing as I says that there will be a high leverage approach to doing so. The work that we\u2019ve done in the high end absolutely applicable for the rest of our portfolio.","Kathleen Nemeth","","Next question please. Operator?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Rod Hall of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Rod B. Hall \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, hi guys thanks for taking my question. I just had a follow-up question on earlier question and then other one for Shaygan. So I just wanted to see if Robyn or Rami you guys would give us the order volume growth rate for routers in Q1. And then kind of related to that and that $471 million of backlog exceeding the year. And I know you don\u2019t usually get that number, except for the Q4, but it sounds like I mean your book-to-bill is such as just slightly less than one, is it right to think you\u2019re carrying pretty much as similar level of backlog on its Q2.","And then for Shaygan, I just Shaygan could you comment on, I think you made comment before about how you\u2019re reallocating technical resources for large accounts and trying to just get more effective the way you put together Juniper\u2019s product range when you talk to these big accounts or looking at architecture. I just wondered if you could comment on how far through that you are and whether you have learned anything from those changed engagement levels with some of those accounts? Thanks.","Robyn Denholm","So, Rod. I\u2019ll start on the order booking commentary. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the order booking overall for the company was higher then our revenue growth and that\u2019s very good thing for Q1 actually. And as you know typically when we are going into the next quarter a lot of the backlog is our routing products. And so, as Shaygan mentioned earlier that is one of the reasons why we are confident in our routing in a pipeline, because we have visibility to that we also have visibility to the design wins and we have a very good portfolio in terms of routing across the board as Rami mentioned. So, I think that answers your question with that our overall bookings rate was higher than our revenue growth in the quarter.","Shaygan Kheradpir","And Rod, on your second question. Yes, I have embedded deep personally with our teams in many of these accounts that\u2019s have been here across all those segments that we mentioned. And I have tell you, once your are underground and you see the action and you see all the interesting workloads and very new and non-linear workloads that our customers are trying to handle and the problems were trying to solve on the innovation side, on the quality side revenue generation, automation and like it is absolutely paramount that we have our in the best and brightest teams on go-to-market on operations on technical and engineering shoulder-to-shoulder with them.","And so this now have you heard this saying, people have heard me to say this before have been through. These cycles, when we are going through non linearity or inflection points in tech. We are absolutely going through one of this five years from now history if is a judge we normalize and then we can go normal formations and every can do there little bits and brigade can begin of delivery. This is not one of those times if you sit in with the cloud providers, Web 2.0, carriers and so forth and so on cable, financial services and the like. They are trying to solve stuff that frankly they had never seen before in terms of sophistication, complexity, scale, why is that the case is because everything is more as a service delivered to the end market continuously and that requires a different level of scale and sophistication and every company has a different starting point, every company has a different enduser market that they are trying to satisfy. Every company is trying to get an edge in this new world that they all see. And so being in force and in-depth in these companies to ensure you don\u2019t miss those nuances and we can execute on them and normalize those features in your product line is absolutely crucial.","Now the great news about Juniper is this is what Juniper is. They are a builder company by DNA, so it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for all of us in Juniper to engage and grow up our sleeves. And I have to tell you I\u2019m having a fantastic time being at the shop floor of all these accounts and it\u2019s phenomenal what\u2019s going on, on the ground.","I\u2019ve been in this business almost 30 years in networking and this reminds me of the days when I first came out of college and I saw this, it\u2019s very cool, it\u2019s very exciting, it\u2019s very sophisticated, and the world out there really desperate to meet all these innovations that we are an increasingly in place to deliver and to do that you have to have different skill and know-how and be able to take customers from one side of the river to the other side and build a bridge for them. So, yes, long answer to your question. We are super excited to Juniper about this opportunity.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay, great. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Modoff \u2013 Deutsche Bank Research","Hi, guys. I have a couple of questions if I could. First, in terms of the cutbacks in R&D, do you worry about any of those cutbacks impacting some of your next generation ASIC developments for your kind of a MX PTX products coming out next year?","Second, can you talk about kind of work here in the STN framework what your least fine strategy is, do you plan, right now is 110 gig switches, top-of-rack switches that are driving your revenues? What\u2019s your strategy on 1040, can you talk a little bit about that please? Thank you.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Sure. So let me assure you, we are not cutting any muscle out of R&D that matters to our strategy and to our customers, in fact, it\u2019s the opposite. We are focusing our forces around a set of things that we think truly matter and we\u2019re putting all the force rather than be distributed and distracted. So we should view IOP as a focus on sort of big things that matter, and obviously ASIC know that you just mentioned is one of them.","On the switching side I have Rami chime in, obviously we cannot give competitive information, where we\u2019re going. But I can tell you what the customers tell me about their switching line is that it already has a lot of capabilities like I mentioned in service software upgrade micro bursting, Virtual Chassis, which people love and so forth and so on. And in terms of its fees and feeds, Rami, do you want to take that?","Rami Rahim","Yes, sure. First, I\u2019ll just reiterate what Shaygan said about R&D from the guidance running R&D, it\u2019s pretty much most of the cuts we\u2019ve made for structural nature were a result of the decomplexifying if you will the organization streamlining things so I am not concerned our ability to compete. And in fact you mentioned silicon, I am very excited about the silicon roadmap that we had in the works right now in Juniper.","On the FDN framework in fact part of the reason why you\u2019re seeing the growth that we have right now in switching is preciously because of the fact that we are building a set of switching building blocks. These are building blocks that have a number of different applications, the data center and cloud automation being a very important used case. So, we are building directly into our switches the kinds of automation, visibility, controllability and very importantly open this there are customers absolutely like.","And that give us the ability to work with great partners like VMware, where we are going in addressing private cloud like virtualization environment for many of our customers, but also with contrail, where for example in public cloud scenarios or in network function virtualization. There is a really nice seamless if you will tie in between the controller and our switches. This is very much a 10-gig story today, but the products were offering are all 10-gig, 40-gig and there is in fact going to be this migration overtime to 40-gig. So work that well setup to take advantage of that 10-gig to 40-gig migration that\u2019s happening in the market.","Kathleen Nemeth","","Okay, great. And we do have time for couple of more questions. We\u2019re coming up on the hour so operator next question please.","","Operator","The next question is from Jason Ader of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Jason Ader \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC","Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on an earlier question around the identification of other user product lines that you might be exceeding and I know you want to give competitive information, which I totally respect. But I guess the question is have you identified other use in product lines at this point or you still in that process. And then secondly just for Robyn, can you give us the guidance for interest and other income now that you have in your debt flowing through the balance sheet?","Robyn Denholm","Rami, you would answer the question","Rami Rahim","Yeah, sure. I\u2019ll start. The question of did we actually take action already, the answer is yes, we have gone through the analysis we\u2019ve evaluated the projects that we are already undertaken and we have in fact reallocate resources of the project that all pre-revenue and that has already given us an ability to start to focus on some of the really important strategic initiatives around cloud, High Q network function virtualization FDN that\u2019s just very meaningful to our customers and I just kind of leave it that.","Robyn Denholm","Thanks, Rami. So on the interest side yes, clearly the interest rate, borrowings that we made in the quarter will add to our interest expense in the quarter, next quarter. So, we expect that we had reasonably low interest quarter for this quarter is just under $10 million. We expected to be in the $14 million to $16 million range for the next quarter.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay, great. Next question operator.","","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","","Kulbinder S. Garcha \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","","Thanks and most of my questions has been answered. I just wondered a broad one for Rami in the routing side, we\u2019ve seen historically just cycles in this business driven partly by product repurchase sometimes by macro. I am just thinking as we come to this repurchase, can you speak about how it\u2019s different and how this won\u2019t be a situation where by from now with difficult comps looking at significant deteriorated revenue line what\u2019s different of value, which is - what that top two or three things that come to mind that would help?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Okay, yes sure Kulbinder, I\u2019d say again you have to take a look at the market opportunity and the service provider spend in light of cable and in light of web services. And also telcos of course and each of these have a very different set of drivers and the cable space for example there is a huge amount of demand on the network because of the video traffic. In the web services space its things like cloud data center interconnect and peering technology. And telcos the things like consolidation of different network functions into fewer networks that are capable of providing a multitude of different services. Network function virtualization and so forth.","These are trends that have been in the market for some time and they will continue. Now there might be ebbs and flows if you will of spending in different parts of the market like in the core or on the edge and different architectural approaches that our customers take, might in fact put more pressure on certain parts of the market or network then in others. And again I will just go back to my statement that is just really important for us to make sure that we\u2019ve got the solutions and the product that can satisfy those architectural trends irrespective of the way that they in fact play out or timing of how they play out.","If you look at all that, and you look again at the broader definition of the service provider that I talked about I think that the opportunity for us to have a good revenue, its healthy growth in the TAM and a great product portfolio help that took advantage of it.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay great, and operator we have time for one more question before we close today.","Operator","Thank you and the next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Paul J. Silverstein \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","It\u2019s always great to be last you can ask unlimited number of questions. Let me start off.","Kathleen Nemeth","Hi Paul.","Paul J. Silverstein \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi Kathleen appreciate you taken the question. A couple of questions if I may first of, can you all talk about pricing trends in switching, co-routing and edge routing. In switching how much of the growth is new customers, how much is from existing customers and with the respect to existing customers how much of that growth is from a refresher or upgrades to the new 9200 relatively new 9200 platform from the older EX platforms and how much is more organic. And that on to security piece can you set some insight, I know you told us that the old NetScreen OS point products are now 15% down from 20% but with respect to the SRX.","How much of the revenue is from the enterprise SRX which you have been struggling on track and how much is from the higher end product that\u2019s been doing so well, as we try to understand going forward. One last question which is I know the legal expenses questions has been asked a lot, but my simple question is if then when legal expense comes back to normalized level is that over and above the OpEx reductions that you have projected in the IOP or is that part of the IOP projections?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Okay so we\u2019ll go one at a time quickly. We start with the IOP question, we have a very rigorous disciplined execution path 4160 we are committed to 160 \u2013 and so that\u2019s we leave it at that, so that I think it\u2019s the moving parts, we are going to hit 160 in the glide path as Robyn went through and we put on our slide back.","Robyn Denholm","What was the other question?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Okay, on pricing Robyn, do you want to take a cover?","Robyn Denholm","Yes, Paul as I mentioned in my prepared remarks it is a competitive environment overall. And what you could see now in gross margin \u2013 our product gross margin, we are actually doing quite well on that. Year-over-year we saw a slight degradation due to mix, but quarter-over-quarter actually was only one can stand, and as you can see we are moving into different categories and that type of thing and our gross margins are doing very well. And so that\u2019s because we are focused on innovation and differentiation with the product set. It\u2019s also because we are focused on reducing our costs over time as well, and as a company we\u2019ve had a huge focus on that over the past four to six quarters. Rami, do you want to add anything in terms of competitiveness.","Rami Rahim","No, that\u2019s it. We focused on the parts of the market where the discussion with the customers certainly in both pricing, but it\u2019s not purely about pricing it\u2019s about a multitude of things and capabilities in addition to pricing and that\u2019s what we do I think quite well.","Shaygan Kheradpir","And then I think that last one and maybe I\u2019ll ask Robyn and Rami as well is I mean I coupled a last sort of two questionnaires, this company the diversity revenue now across those segment it\u2019s just not that one segment, it is multiple segments and then when you overlay the dynamics of these segment with all the different types of workloads that they are trying to handle as they build their clouds in High IQ networks.","It\u2019s a \u2013 one size doesn\u2019t fit all, right and we see that sort of in switching, security and routing like your questions on switching, mostly new customers, but its frankly when you look at the, that the type of workloads it is not sort of commodity closet switches. It\u2019s actually quite interesting sort of the used cases that we handle. Rami, do you want to sort of take the switching question and I think that was also part of your question.","Rami Rahim","I don\u2019t have an exact figure in my head of what the ratio is, it\u2019s both. I mean we love selling to our customers chassis that are partly populated with lying card, whether they have been in switching, and routing or security because we are reserving self base that we can go and populate over a period of time, and there is a lot of that going on. But as we also mentioned in the prepared remarks and earlier in the Q&A, we\u2019re winning global bank, we\u2019re winning web services companies that are all leveraging our switching, routing and security products and that just adds on to our business some it\u2019s the combination.","Robyn Denholm","So on the security side I can answer that for you Paul in terms of our Junos Space firewall security product, you were right it was less than 20% a year ago and now it\u2019s less than 15% that\u2019s related to the non-Junos Space products. In terms of the SRX products they grew 13% year-over-year and in terms of the contribution to that growth the majority in this quarter was service provider, but we also had year-over-year growth in terms of enterprise as well. And as Rami mentioned before some of the focus that we\u2019ve had on the high end SRX over this last four quarters to actually improve the performance of that is equally applicable in terms of the branch SRX and those types of products and that\u2019s what the team has focused on as we move forward here.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay, great. So that is all the time that we have this afternoon. We appreciate your participation and all of your great questions, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you so much everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; and Stefan Dyckerhoff, Executive Vice President, Platform System.","Before Kevin gets started, I would like to highlight changes to our financial reporting, which are reflected in today's earnings press release. As we have discussed previously, Juniper is aligning our business segment reporting to the company's organizational structure and focus on its platform and software strategy. We believe this change will provide investors with increased financial reporting transparency and will enable better insight into the market and performance trends driving the company's business. Juniper's 2 reportable segments are now the Platforms Systems Division, which will often be referred to as PSD, and Software Solutions Division, or SSD.","Our press release provides a description of each segment including the products within each segment. There is a table included in Appendix 2, which identifies the specific products by segment within routings, switching and security.","The PSD segment aligns primarily with the Infrastructure segment under the historical reporting approach and consists of routing, switching and security products and services. Note that security products, such as the branch SRX, branch firewall and J-Series product families, which are now in PSD were historically reported as part of our SLT segment.","The SSD segment aligns primarily with the SLT segment under the historical reporting approach and consists of security and routing products and services. Note that routing products, such us routing services software, which are now in SSD were historically reported as part of our Infrastructure segment. Detailed information including 2011 and 2010 announced as they would have been reported under the new approach is included in the Appendix of today's press release and are provided in Excel tables on the Investor Relations page of our website. These include quarterly segment revenues with product detail, segment contribution margins and corporate unallocated expenses.","Please remember when listening to today's that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply-chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-K filed with the SEC.","All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event, facts or circumstances change after the date of this call.","In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.","On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier.","GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates.","Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour. [Operator Instructions]","With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin R. Johnson","Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Juniper executed well in the first quarter, delivering results that were better than forecast in a market environment that, as expected, continue to be dynamic by geography. I'll provide some detail on how we see business unfolding here in the first half of the year, including the solid traction we're seeing with our new products. I've also asked Stefan Dyckerhoff, who heads our Platforms Systems Division, to provide some further depth from the progress we are making on our innovation agenda. After Stefan's comments, Robyn will provide the financial review.","First quarter results reflect demand from our large Service Provider customers and some declines in Enterprise routing. Geographically, we saw continued headwinds in EMEA, as expected. But we saw good wins and activity across all of our theaters. We're also seeing new products contribute to results, including a solid first full quarter of revenue from our recently introduced T4000 core router. Our switching performance remains solid in light of the market environment, and we're gaining traction with our QFabric offerings.","In security, SRX posted good results in the first quarter. Customers have responded very positively to the recent update of the user interface of security configuration and device management software. We are continuing to manage prudently and carefully in this environment.","Service providers continue to be thoughtful with their spending. Our largest customers have a clear focus on maximizing efficiency as measured by capital to spend to revenue.","The focus on efficiencies supporting important architectural transitions, such as the convergence of the wireline and wireless Edge, which is a great opportunity for our MX Series of Edge routers. In fact, our recent MX capacity upgrades, coupled with the T4000 core router's powerful throughput, enables Juniper to leverage our install base on both the core and the Edge. These differentiated products are helping customers reduce their cost per bit of traffic, while driving operating efficiencies across their business.","Service Providers drive for capital spending efficiency aligns with the strategic priority of the drive our innovation agenda. We are innovating in areas that are highly relevant to our customers, both in mobility and in the cloud. We're delivering differentiated solutions that change the economics and experience of networking for our customers. We are taking an architectural approach for solutions that enable our customers to address some of the most critical challenges they face. And it's important to keep in mind that architectural changes take time and close customer collaboration. We feel good about how our customers, both existing Juniper customers and new customers, are responding to our approach and our solution.","The T4000 generated good revenue in the first quarter. We recorded our first PTX revenues and are pleased with the orders we are receiving. We continue to win new customers with QFabric, and we are enabling numerous production deployments.","Within security, we continue to strengthen our portfolio with new features and improved usability. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on execution. Our new products are a result of good execution in R&D, and we continue to expand our go-to-market capabilities.","Our innovation agenda is on track. We are confident in the value of the solutions we are delivering, and the customer traction and feedback we are seeing supports that confidence. We believe in the long-term fundamentals driving the new network. Our strategy for long-term value creation is clear, and it consists of 5 key elements.","One, we are a pure play in high-performance networking, with an addressable market opportunity for Juniper that is large and growing; two, we are an innovation-driven company, which means we will continue to invest in R&D that delivers customer value; three, we are leveraging our R&D investment across both the Service Provider and Enterprise customer base; four, we are diversifying that customer base by broadening our Service Provider business and by expanding breadth and depth in both Service Provider and Enterprise; and five, we are complementing our systems strategy with the software business centered on the one Junos platform.","Our long-term view is positive. Certainly, the near-term environment requires continued caution, and we're addressing that with a focus on execution and adherence to our operating principles.","Trends of mobile Internet and cloud have created the potential for transformational opportunity for Juniper. With great innovation and great execution, we believe we are positioned very well to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us.","With that, I'll hand off to Stefan.","Stefan Dyckerhoff","Thanks, Kevin. It's a pleasure to join the earnings call this quarter. In February, while attending the Mobile World Congress, Bob Muglia and I had the opportunity to present our strategy innovation agenda focused on systems and software. As we articulated, Juniper's strategy for the new network enables customers to improve economics and experiences of networking. We are doing this by offering a common network platform with powerful and programmable systems, on top of which, Juniper and our ecosystem partners can build software-driven solutions.","We have aligned organizational structure to our new network strategy, with the platform -- with the formation of the Platforms Systems Division and the Software Solutions Divisions, which reflect how we manage our business. We have introduced the New Network Platform Architectures, which allow us to view our products, solutions and value propositions through the customer lens, segmented by network domain.","We are an innovation-driven company, which partners closely with our customers to solve the hardest networking problems. A critical component of our strategy is our commitment to leveraging our R&D investment in order to develop solutions that span both Service Provider customers and our growing Enterprise customer base. The new products we have brought to market in the last year from QFabric to T4000 to PTX to MX upgrades and ACX were all designed and built to deliver differentiated value for both segments.","We now have the strongest and most robust portfolio in the history of the company. The architectural approach we are taking with our innovation agenda requires patience and close work with our customers. We are in the midst of that, and we feel good about the progress we are making on our new products. I'll walk through this in more detail, starting with the core.","Several customers have embraced our vision of the Converged Supercore, and we are seeing robust early demand for both of our new products, the T4000 and the PTX. We saw good initial revenue performance for T4000 in the first quarter, with recent buyers of the product including Australia-based, Telstra; and U.K.-based, Virgin Media. We have strong customer engagement for the PTX across all geographies, including orders from customers, such as the London Internet Exchange. We have been pleased with the customer reaction to the product.","We also had important product news on the Edge in early 2012. In addition to the switch fabric upgrades, we started shipping in Q4 2011, which allow our customers to double the performance of their MX installed base, we also saw great traction for our 100-gig interfaces on MX, which started shipping in the first quarter.","With the PTX, T1600 and T4000 also delivering 100-gig interfaces, we have a compelling 100-gig story from Converged Supercore to Edge. The MX product line has been the most successful product in the history of Juniper and combined with the ACX product line for access and navigation, which we will ship later this year, we see continued growth, opportunities across wireless and wireline applications.","Now let's turn to the campus and data center and talk about switching and fabric.","Our EX Series of product was our entry into the switching market. These products continue to be a key lever in our drive into the enterprise across campus and data center applications. The next step in our data center innovation agenda has been to simplify the next-generation data center networks to one layer, driving capital efficiencies and significant operational benefits for the virtual data center and emerging clouds.","We believe our QFabric sets the industry standard for performance and simplicity, and we are satisfied with the customers' response to this technology since we introduced it last year. We now have over 150 customers for the QFX product line, and are seeing them embrace the solution in a variety of different configurations, ranging from top-of-rack installations to full fabric deployments.","We are pleased to have the first full fabric deployments running in live production. Those deployments include Qihoo 360 in China and Australia-based Oracle. In Q1, we also had a QFabric win in Europe at Jan Yperman hospital in Belgium. Customer feedback overall is good, and we are encouraged with the pipeline we are building.","So overall in switching and fabric, we are pleased with the progress. We are seeing success in data center and campus, and our architectural innovation is gaining customer traction.","One of the main drivers behind the early success we are seeing has been very good execution in R&D. Our approach has always been about silicon, systems and software, and you're seeing all 3 coming together in our new products.","Our Trio chipset is powering the MX and T4000, while our Express chipset, optimized for high-capacity transport, is the reason the PTX maintains 4x the density of any competing product. We have also done a tremendous amount of work in our Junos R&D program, delivering capabilities, which are key to the customer experience with our products. We are delivering a single network operating system to more easily integrate into customer workflow and provide an open, programmable platform for rapid service innovation.","I'll conclude my comments by highlighting a few key takeaways. From silicon to systems to software, we are executing on our innovation agenda. Customer feedback around our solution has been very positive. All of our new products are in active customer engagements across all geographies, resulting in design wins, trials and live deployments. The innovations we are bringing to market are architecture-driven. They are designed in collaboration with our customers and in response to their needs. And as with any new architecture, implementation is a multistage process.","Again, we are pleased with the progress we are seeing and how we are delivering against our innovation agenda.","I will now turn the call over to Robyn.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thank you, Stefan, and good afternoon, everyone. Juniper's results in the March quarter reflect our focus on disciplined operational excellence, with revenue and earnings exceeding our guided ranges. We are pleased with the early customer demand for our new products, reflected in orders for PTX, T4000 and QFabric. While we are still in the early phases of these new product cycles, customer feedback on our disruptive innovation is highly encouraging.","We saw a sequential increase in Service Provider revenue, driven primarily by large U.S. customers. As anticipated, the orders we received in the third quarter of 2011 contributed to this quarter's strength in Service Provider revenue. This was offset by an expected decline in Enterprise as a result of typical seasonality and our strong fourth quarter performance in Federal routing.","While we believe the long-term demand fundamentals are intact, many customers continue to exercise care in the investment prioritization and project deployment. We are focused on executing our strategy, while prudently managing the near-term.","Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter. Book-to-bill was slightly below 1. Product deferred revenue was roughly flat sequentially. Total revenue was $1,032,000,000, a decline of 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Verizon continues to be a strategic customer, accounting for approximately 15% of total revenue this quarter. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks.","For the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.03. GAAP diluted earnings included $0.03 impact for charges associated with the write down of an equity investment, restructuring and other items. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.16, down $0.12 sequentially and down $0.16 from a year ago. The decline from the first quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower revenue and gross margins.","Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the first quarter, the Americas were approximately 51% of total revenue; EMEA, 30%; and APAC, 19%. Americas' revenue was up 2% sequentially and declined 9% year-over-year. The sequential growth was primarily due to the largest U.S. service providers, whilst the year-over-year decline was mainly due to regional and content service providers.","EMEA revenue was down 23% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. This sequential decline was primarily attributable to comparisons against the record Q4 and a decline in Service Provider revenue in Southern and parts of Central Europe.","APAC revenue declined 3% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. While Japan showed sequential growth due to better performance in Service Provider, it was down compared to a strong quarter last year as we completed a large Service Provider deployment. We did see a slowdown in revenue across the rest of the region.","Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platforms Systems Division revenue was $824 million, down 8% both sequentially and year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $458 million, down 4% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to a decrease in spending in Enterprise. The year-over-year decline was due to lower spending by international, U.S. regional and content service providers.","Total router revenue, including both PSD and SSD, was $479 million. Total switching product revenue was $124 million, down 21% sequentially from a record level in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, switching was up strongly at 23%, driven by EX4500 and EX2200, as well as an increase in shipments of our QFabric solution.","Software Solutions Division revenue in the first quarter was $208 million, down 9% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. High-end SRX product revenue for the quarter remained strong. We saw increases sequentially and year-over-year driven by Service Provider demand. We expect high-end SRX revenues to continue to fluctuate with the timing of customer deployments.","Enterprise security was down sequentially and year-over-year as we worked to improve the feature offering of our Enterprise security customers.","Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $685 million, up 1% sequentially due to strength in routing and security. Revenue was down 8% on a year-over-year basis due to reduced demand in routing.","Enterprise revenue was $347 million, down 22% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to lower routing business coming off a strong Q4 in Federal and seasonality in switching and security. Year-over-year, the decline was due to lower Enterprise routing and security.","For the quarter, Service Provider was 66% of total revenue and Enterprise was 34% of total revenue.","Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter was 62.6% compared to 63.3% last quarter. Product gross margins were 64.6% of product revenue, up slightly on a sequential basis. As expected, our product gross margins continue to be negatively impacted by product and geographic mix, as well as inventory-related costs.","Services gross margins were 56.8%, down nearly 4 points from the prior quarter. This was primarily the result of the reset of variable compensation and an increase in spare parts related to the new product introductions.","While the pricing environment continues to be competitive, our strategy remains consistent, to differentiate on innovation and focus on cost improvements through our supply chain.","Non-GAAP operating expenses increased sequentially as expected to $523 million, driven by typical Q1 increases in employee expenses.","Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,218 employees, a sequential increase of 89 as we continue to hire strategically to support our long-term objectives.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12% due to increased operating expenses and lower gross margins.","Looking at segment contribution margins, which reflect revenues less expenses directly attributable to the segment organization.","For PSD, the contribution margin was 37%; and for SSD, contribution margin was 39%. The sequential decline for both segments was primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses.","The GAAP tax rate was 30.1% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%, up 2.1 points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the tax rate shows a sequential and year-over-year increase due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011.","Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of total cash and investment. This was a reduction of $77 million from the prior quarter is mainly the result of the acquisitions of both Mykonos and the assets of BitGravity.","Our net cash and investment was $3.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $102 million. Cash flow was lower sequentially due to the lower income generated this quarter and was impacted by the semi-annual bond interest payment.","DSO was 39 days in the quarter, down from 46 days last quarter, but in line with 38 days in the first quarter of last year.","CapEx and depreciation were consistent with prior quarters.","We repurchased $51.6 million or 2.4 million shares at an average price of $21.75. Our policy remains consistent that over time we aim to offset the dilutive impact of our employee stock programs.","Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we will manage the business assuming the near-term environment requires continued caution. We will remain focused on executing our strategy, while maintaining a balanced approach to the near and long term.","Given this view, we are expecting revenues to range from $1,030,000,000 to $1,060,000,000. Both gross margins and operating expenses for the second quarter are expected to be roughly in line with the first quarter.","As a result, we expect operating margins for the second quarter to range from 12% to 14%. We anticipate that operating margins should improve from this level through the rest of the year. This is expected to result in a second quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.17 per share, and assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%. This tax rate assumes that there is no renewal of the R&D tax credit.","In summary, we will continue to navigate the near-term environment carefully. Our new products are gaining momentum as customers see the value of our disruptive innovations. We are focused on disciplined operational execution, driving progress on our new product trend introductions and investing in critical areas of our business.","I want to thank our fabulous employees for their dedication and hard work. Their commitment to innovation is key to our success in delivering the new network.","And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Kevin, this one might be for you. I think that we have seen a loss in the overall carrier industry, about a slowdown over the last few quarters, according to their CapEx budgets, included the first quarter. You folks, though, seemed to have been able to manage through that with a seasonally up quarter. What can you tell us about the spending patterns for the rest of the year? Should we be expecting further improvements in your Service Provider revenues through the year? Or is this sort of where we are and caution from here?","Kevin R. Johnson","I think -- first of all, I think, it's perhaps a bit too early to outline what we think will happen for carrier capital expenditures for the full year. Obviously, we look at the guidance that our large customers provide for capital expenditures. And I think there's a couple of things that we observe, one is that with our large U.S. tier-1 Service Providers. In Q1, their capital expenditures were about 21% to 22% of what they've guided for full year, which does show that there's -- it's reverting back to a more seasonal pattern that we've seen several years ago, at least with that Q1 number. There's still are significant headwinds in Europe, and I think that's, that one that we've seen service providers be very cautious in their capital expenditures. And so I think it's still a fairly dynamic environment. I think our focus is going to be clearly on execution. Now as we've got these new products in market and we're engaging with customers for the architectural designing win and the trials to get these products deployed and drive revenue, that's going to be our primary focus. But overall, I'd say it's still a bit of a mixed bag and it's too early to call.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Kevin, I appreciate the innovation agenda and the message you've made here. But as I look at the expense structure, OpEx as a percentage of sales is now north of -- slightly north of 50% of revenue, that's actually the highest in 8 years. How should we think about getting a return on those investments? And is this just kind of the bottom, and we should start to see a more rationalization of R&D expenses going forward? Just trying to understand that disconnect between this rise in OpEx that we've seen here, again 8-year high, versus getting a good return, making sure we're getting a good return on that investment.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes. I think it's a very valid question. Certainly, we're at an interesting point in the evolution of the company, in that, we've just released some very significant products. And so the R&D expenditures for those products are at the peak as we're releasing those, whether it's PTX, T4000, QFabric, as an example, and yet the revenue hasn't kicked in on those products. So as a result, we end up with an operating expense envelope that's higher as a percentage of revenue than we would like long term. So the key for us right now is drive execution on the go-to-market side and drive that top line revenue to get leverage on the R&D investment. Now clearly, the operating principles that we've stated for 2012 are clear that we view that Q1 to be the point that we're going to build some operating leverage throughout the year, and much of that's going to come from top line revenue. But clearly, it's up to us to really drive execution in market and translate the investment we've made in R&D to top line revenue and a return for shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Marshall with the ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Looking at the gross margins here, I think this is -- gross margins have been headed down 6 out of the last 7 quarters, I believe. And so I guess the trend is pretty clear. I'm wondering due to the comments with respect to operating margins coming up for the rest of the year, and you just -- commenting that, that's as far it's going to be, driven by revenue. Should we expect some margin on the gross margins side to expand as the new products ramp at higher margins than current existing product margins? Any color there will be helpful, throughout the year.","Robyn M. Denholm","In terms of the gross margins, what I said in my prepared remarks was that actually product revenue -- our product gross margins were up slightly quarter-over-quarter, and that was reflective of the slightly higher routing mix in the overall product revenue. So in terms of the headline gross margin number at 62.6%, it is a decline quarter-over-quarter, but it was mainly the result, in fact, primarily the result of the services gross margin. So what we've seen this quarter with services gross margin, they actually went to 56.8% as a result of the increase in employee expenses, typical of the first quarter but also an increase in spare parts costs because we are bringing the new products to market. So those costs were up quarter-over-quarter. So from an overall gross margin perspective, we expect them to be roughly flat in the second quarter, in line with revenue. As we improve or increase the proportion of routing revenue to total revenue for product, the gross margins will increase. And so yes, as Kevin said, we're expecting to drive leverage in the model through the top line, but we're also looking at improvements in the product gross margins as we move forward here with the new product introductions as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe I'll just get Stefan into the mix here. Stefan, we missed you last week at the Open Networking Summit, so I just wanted to ask you some questions around that. In particular, how do you see QFabric now fitting in within the trend toward software-defined networking? And also it seems like some key customers like Google and Verizon are now embracing software-defined networking-type technologies as opposed to QFabric, and some of the customer wins you've pointed to seemed to be somewhat smaller types of enterprises or hospitals and things like that. So where do you see demand at this point shaping up for QFabric? And then just lastly, on that topic, of the 150 customers you talked about, roughly what percent are deploying the full fabric versus the top-of-rack solution?","Stefan Dyckerhoff","So let me start by talking a little bit about the Open Networking Summit where actually my team was well represented. Michael Beesly, our CTO, presented together with one of our customers on the data center side to talk about how we see the use of SDN type technology in the data center and for enterprises, specifically. So when I think about SDN, I see a lot of the goals that we've outlined for the new network in terms of improved economics, experiences and unleashing innovation on top of the network reflected in the industry movement that is SDN. And certainly we have been at the forefront of that movement through opening up APIs into our operating system with the Junos SDK, through supporting all of the various technologies that are parts of SDN, whether that be OpenFlow or BD [ph], BTE or PCE. We are going to continue to focus on the programmability as one of the key aspects that we can deliver with Junos. So when you then say, \"Okay, what's the use of that technology in the data center?\" One of the key things to realize is that virtualization drives the need to reconfigure the network but also drives performance in the network. So a flat, anything in connectivity between the services is very important for an SDN-type deployment. And certainly the customers that have adopted QFabric, whether that's a Thomson Reuters or whether that's a Deutsche Boers or more recently Qihoo 360, have all seen that benefit play out in the physical infrastructure. And then on top of that, they will make sure that they have the probability to actually deploy the services on top of that infrastructure. So we don't see that there's a choice between SDN or QFabric. QFabric is part of our new network strategy, and programmability is always going to be at the forefront of that strategy and SDN share some of those goals. Now lastly, to your point around the 150 customers, so we have a mix of deployments for the customers who have adopted the QFX product line. They range from top-of-rack to full fabric. The reason they adopt the product line is because we have strategic alignment with them on the architecture that they want to deploy going forward. And so the focus for us is to give them a great experience as they adopt the key pieces of technology and there's a good number of them that actually adopt the full fabric, and as I mentioned, the first 2 in live deployment as of the first quarter. So we're very happy with the progress that we're making there, and just continue to focus on execution with the customer engagements.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of things, some you may not answer; others, hopefully you will. Robyn, any color you can give us in terms of the revenue totals in QFabric, now T4000 and PTX and\/or any kind of bogies or targets you have for the full year for any of them? Would you be helpful for us to get a sense as to how they'll grow or how they'll -- what percentage they look like right now? And then when you have a QFabric sale, a full QFabric sale, like some of the customers you mentioned, can you give us a sense as to what percentage of that is top-of-rack versus what percentage is the interconnect part, the other parts? So what I'm trying to get at is if someone is actually buying a bunch of top-of-rack switches, but hasn't fully committed yet to the interconnect, had they but 70% of the solution already? Or is it only 20 or 30%, and that's much more to go if you have the interconnect? And then finally, on the Edge securities side, you said you were working on some features, and I think a lot of third parties out there say that you've been losing some share on the Edge and the security side. If you can talk to us about that business and what you can do to restore your position on the Edge and security would be great.","Robyn M. Denholm","In terms of the T4000, PTX revenue and QFabric revenue, we haven't disclosed those, and we're not going to now. They're modest amounts of revenue. Obviously QFabric is growing a couple of quarters now revenue that is growing nicely. PTX, it was the first quarter of revenue, and we're very pleased with the revenue that we recorded in the quarter, and as Stefan mentioned, the orders that we received for that. In terms of T4000, the same thing. Obviously we started shipping late in the fourth quarter. Again, first full quarter of revenue, and we're pleased with the customer engagement that we have on that front. In terms of the ramp of those products, it's too early to call that at this point. We will talk a little bit more about that at the Analyst Meeting in a few weeks here.","Stefan Dyckerhoff","So Ehud, this is Stefan. If I can just expand on the QFabric part of your question. As we look at the QFabric product line, all of our customers, it's an architectural discussion, and we start with whatever they want to start with, whether the top-of-rack that they need to  deploy, has to deploy 10-gig service, they can leverage their investment through taking the on-ramp to the QFabric, so it's a gradual approach that they can take in order to deploy their capital more efficiently going forward. Certainly with the distributive nature of top-of-racks, you made a good step forward in adopting the full system, if you have deployed the top-of-racks, and it will make it significantly simpler. And as their businesses dictate that additional performance of a data center, they're going to go do that. But we're very happy with the kind of architectural alignment we have with the customers and the road that they're on.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes. I'll comment on the third part of your question, specifically on security. I think it was a -- this was a strong quarter for us with the SRX. I think it was roughly within $1 million of the highest quarter we've had of SRX revenue. And I mean it reflects the strength that we're seeing in the scenarios for Service Provider, and I think we've been very transparent that the work we're doing around our security designer software, which is basically software that is the user interface for configuring and managing these security devices in the enterprise, we had an initial release -- or a release of that software in Q1. We've got some further releases coming throughout the year. We've been very open with our customers. And so the focus that we have in many ways on our security agenda is to really address the opportunity to improve the user interface and user experience for enterprise customers as they configure and manage these security devices, and we're seeing good response thus far in the quarter from the work that we've done, and we've got a good road map, and I think at the Financial Analyst Meeting, we'll provide a deeper dive on the overall end-to-end security strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to -- Robyn, just to clarify your comment on operating margins just to make sure I got it. You're saying that operating margin will increase sequentially each quarter going forward, or that it will just be higher in future quarters than it is now? I just wanted to clarify that. The second thing I wanted to ask was on the APAC revenue decline. If you guys could give any color on that, I thought it was down 12% year-over-year, so just any color on what's happening there, anything specific. And then circling back to that comment on revenue proportions and so on, the T4000, I'm just curious if you could give us any kind of idea whether that -- would that be the majority of routing revenue as you exit the quarter -- or core routing revenue that is, as you exit the year I mean? Or is that more of a 2013 event when that becomes the majority of core routing revenue?","Robyn M. Denholm","Okay. So in terms of operating margin, what I said in the prepared remarks is that Q2 will be somewhere between 12% and 14%, reflective of the flat to up revenue, with similar gross margins and similar OpEx to the first quarter. Our operating principle is to expand operating margins through the year, and so we're very focused on that, as Kevin mentioned and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, in terms of continuing to drive revenue growth and continuing to drive operational efficiencies across the company as well. So in terms of APAC, what I talked about in my prepared remarks, and then maybe Kevin would like to comment as well, was that we did see year-over-year declines. The primary reason for that is Q1 of last year, which was pre-tsunami, if you remember tsunami was 03\/11. We actually had completed in the first quarter a large service provider deployment in Japan. We talked about that at the time. And so our year-over-year comparisons were very high for Q1 of last year, and so that was the year-over-year decline story in Japan. We did see a sequential increase in Service Provider demand in Japan, which we were pleased about.","Kevin R. Johnson","And I'll just add to that, I think we saw an opportunity in China that pushed out of Q1 that we're still focused on, and I think as Robyn said, we've got a very good Service Provider business in Japan and relationship in Japan. But we have an opportunity in Japan to diversify our customer base and expand beyond the set of service providers into other service providers and into more enterprise customers through our partners in Japan. And so I look at the emerging market opportunities that we have and China and India and how we continue to drive execution and diversifying the customer base in Japan.","Stefan Dyckerhoff","And let me finally comment on some of the new products. So with our newest release of Junos, we support the T4K, the MX upgrade, as well as the PTX. So as we look at customer qualifications for those, the PTX have contributed minimal revenue in the quarter, and we see a qualification time that is in the 9- to 12-month range typically for such a new system. And then from there our customers, we'll move to deployment. On the T4000, had a slightly higher revenue contribution in the quarter, and we would expect the qualification times to be in the 6- to 9-month range with that type of upgrade. And again, customers will deploy the capital prudently as they move through the year once they have the system qualified. And then last but not least on the MX, we saw good uptake on the MX upgrades in the quarter as we enable those with our new release of Junos, and we're optimistic about the traction of those upgrades as we move through the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos from UBS.","Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two quick questions. Stefan, the Service Provider router market last year grew below 10% after many years of growing stronger double digits. Do you think we're in a new secular growth rate in routing? Or do you think we can recover back to that double-digit -- strong double-digit growth rate? And then, Kevin, a question for you. The company goals had been 20% revenue growth, 25% operating margin. Do you see those goals as still achievable? Obviously this year wouldn't be the case, but do you still see those as targets? Or do you feel new targets need to be established for the company?","Stefan Dyckerhoff","So on router growth, I think what we saw -- what we are seeing overall is that certainly IP technology is a bigger, bigger portion of what drives the business for Service Provider. However, as Kevin mentioned, we think service are going -- service providers are going to continue to be cautious with their CapEx, and that applies to all areas of the business. So I think it's a little bit too early to call the market growth for the rest of the year. Certainly as we work with our Service Provider customers, and we see their plans for deployment of capital towards the markets we address, I think we're in a very good position. But the overall environment for our Service Provider CapEx is something that will remain somewhat uncertain throughout the rest of the year as we stated.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes. Nikos, I'll take your second question and refer back to the operating principles that we've stated for 2012, and I think -- your first question on what will addressable market do in growth, is a relevant question, because one of the operating principles we have is we got to drive to grow faster than the market. And so when markets expand faster, that gives us more opportunity to grow and when they expand slower. We do think we're in a growth market, but frankly the focus is going to be as the operating principle states, which is growing faster than the market. And then the second part of your question is the way to drive operating leverage on the op margin is to drive the top line revenue by monetizing this great set of new products that we've just released in the marketplace. And we've been working hard for a number of years on these products, the silicon that goes into these products, the systems and the software, put together with an architectural approach. And now that we have these products in market, it's up to us to really drive execution and monetize that investment that we've made in R&D. And so the operating principle that states growing and expanding the operating margin from Q1, combined with the operating principle about growing faster than the market, would be sort of the guiding principle. So, Robyn, anything else you want to add.","Robyn M. Denholm","No, I think that's good. In terms of absolute numbers and that type of thing in terms of the model, we're obviously not putting out a new model at this point. We're talking about the operating principles and growing faster than the market in this environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, can you share your observations of the Service Provider orders on a month-to-month basis? And I ask since Verizon was one of the first carriers to fall off and is now one of the first to return. Does your order flow point to a return to a cycle? I recognized that some Europeans are still weak, if their deterioration or just caution, which implies that time frame for a return. And then, Robyn, just a quick question. Routers, if we do -- return to a cycle, can we still get to 68% gross margins? I understand a lot of that is mix related, but do you feel that there's a structural drop in margins for the router market?","Kevin R. Johnson","I'll take the first one and then hand it over to Robyn. Look, in the Service Provider marketplace, the observation that I would have is there's -- certainly in Europe, there's a geographic commonality that's sort of impacted by the macro situation in Europe that creates a certain pattern of cautiousness on those service providers. Then on other service providers, it's on a case-by-case basis. It sort of depends on where they are in the project cycle and how they prioritize things. In some cases, as they're growing their mobile Internet business, they may have one set of priorities and then shift to other priorities. So there's not a common pattern that you see across all of them. But the one thing that is common is certainly they've built their business around delivering value to their customers in the form of networks, and those networks are transitioning to IP packet-switched network, which creates opportunity for us. So that is the one commonality that I see in Service Providers. But there's not some common pattern -- your question was kind of month-to-month. There wasn't some common pattern that I would say fit all service providers. There's some geographic and then it's kind of case-by-case, depending on the customer's situation.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. Mark, in terms of the gross margins, I mean in the near-term, as I said before, we do expect the gross margins to stay in this range. So for Q2, we believe that they'll be roughly flat with the first quarter, reflective of some modest increase at the high end and in terms of revenue, but the gross margins will be roughly the same. In terms of competition and pricing and that type of thing in the marketplace, we obviously are in a competitive market. We have been for a long period of time. Our strategy is very clear though. We deliver innovation to the market, which drives tremendous efficiencies in CapEx and also in OpEx for our customers. And so that is our main focus in terms of delivering the innovation to market. And we will continue to work on the gross margin structure both in terms of the cost side but also as the mix of products increases, particularly with the new products. We'll see gross margins increase as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse.","Paul Silverstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions, if I may. Robyn, can you comment on pricing environment relative to what you've seen in the past? And secondly, in terms of your guidance, we're looking flat to up $30 million depending upon if you were to come in within the range, Kevin or Robyn, can you comment on what the different drivers of that guidance in terms of ramping the new products? And I recognize -- we're talking about very small base business at this point for those new products, but if you could comment, your expectations of the existing business in terms of growth or decline versus the growth in the new products to get you that guidance, that will be appreciated.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. In terms of the revenue guidance for the second quarter, we are looking at flat to slightly up in terms of revenue overall. And in terms of the sectors, what we're anticipating is obviously flat to slightly up from a Service Provider perspective and also from an Enterprise perspective, just given the current environment. In terms of the overall gross margins, I think you talked about -- I'm sorry, it was pricing, I miswrote that. So the pricing environment, as I mentioned, in the last question on gross margins, it's obviously a competitive environment. It has been, for quite some time, in terms of the market dynamics. But it hasn't changed our philosophy in terms of delivering innovation to the market and total cost of ownership for our customers. I mean clearly, as Kevin has mentioned before on the earnings call, we will compete on price to win new customers on a selective basis. And so we will continue to do that on a selective basis, particularly as it relates to extending our reach into certain customers and certain markets and geographies. But overall, the market environment is pretty consistent with what it's been over the last number of quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions, first is just a clarification on gross margin. If revenues go back to date, this quarter then would have been back at their historical levels, let's say, of last quarter -- last year's first quarter. Would margins be in the same level? Or is there an impact of pricing and the aggressiveness of competitors, I just couldn't understand this part. So that's the first question.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, if the mix of product with similar to the mix of product of Q1 of last year, the gross margins would have been similar to what they were a year ago. There wouldn't be that big a difference in terms of the line items of gross margins on the individual products are pretty consistent with were they were a year ago. So that's why in terms of my discussion on the call, it is still mainly the result of product mix with our routing proportion of revenue being relatively low compared to historical averages.","Operator","We have time for one last question, and it comes from the line of Tim Long with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a question on visibility, if we could. Maybe if we just go back to the March quarter, pretty meaningful beat there, and I know, Robyn, it's a tough environment and also you mentioned the orders from Q3 hitting. Could you just kind of give us a sense as to how much of that -- whether it was $50 million, $60 million of revenue beat was due to previous orders and how much of that was in the quarter? And then secondly, when you look into the second quarter, has the visibility improved or not? And is there any deals that had been previously signed that will continue to contribute into the second quarter like they did in the first quarter?","Robyn M. Denholm","In terms of Q1, Q1 pretty much unfolded as we were expecting. Obviously slightly better with our U.S. -- largely with Service Provider customers. So slightly better. But basically the quarter unfolded as we expected it to unfold. In terms of our visibility as we go into Q2, it's about the same. We have obviously -- our product book-to-bill for Q1 was just under 1. We exit Q1 with slightly less backlog then we entered the quarter, but that's typical of the first quarter. And actually we are pretty pleased with the backlogs that we have going into the second quarter. Our deferred revenue from a product perspective is essentially flat sequentially, so we've got visibility to the balance sheet as well. And we also, obviously, continue our dialogues with customers not just about the new product but existing products and design wins that we work with them on and other customer opportunities. So in terms of visibility, it's about the same as it was coming into the first quarter. No better, no worse than 90 days ago.","Operator","I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, operator.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. Thank you. You may begin.","Jess Lubert - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results might differ materially as a result of various risk factors, including those described in our most recent 10-K, the press release, and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Our Q1 2018 results and forward-looking guidance are provided under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis.","Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We performed well compared to our expectations during the March quarter. Total revenue of $1,083 million slightly exceeded the high end of our guidance as better than expected results in our cloud vertical along with continued success in our enterprise business more than offset weaker than expected service provider sales.","Non-GAAP earnings per share also came in at the high end of our guidance at $0.28 due to the higher revenue and margin in line with our forecast. While our results were better than our guidance, we are far from satisfied and are working hard to not only return the business to growth, but drive profitability back toward normalized levels.","We continue to believe we have the right products and strategy to win across our core vertical and we are continuing to innovate with the goal of disrupting our markets and gaining share.","While we believe our greatest near-term opportunity remains in the cloud, we were also playing to win in our enterprise and service provider market. Based on our current product pipeline and recent customer conversation, I remain confident that Juniper controls its own destiny and its position to drive a return to growth and improve profitability by the end of the year.","Now for a few highlights of the quarter. I'm pleased with the progress we are making in our cloud vertical where several of our largest customers are transitioning from our MX to our PTX platforms. While this process is creating ASP pressure in our cloud routing business that is likely to persist over the next few quarters, we believe we are making progress with this transition, which should become less of a headwind through the course of the year.","As proof of our progress, I'd like to highlight that several of our cloud projects that were previously on hold have started to move forward and we expect these deployments to ramp through the remainder of this year and next.","Our cloud routing business experienced sequential growth during the March quarter, a trend we anticipate will continue through the rest of the year.","Our PTX products accounted for more than 80% of the cloud routing ports we shipped on a 10 gig equivalent basis during Q1 compared to less than 40% one year ago. Our cloud routing ASPs began to stabilize sequentially a trend we think is likely to continue as mix headwinds subside through the year. It's also worth mentioning that our cloud switching business exceeded our own expectations in the period.","Based on our results and customer engagements, we remain confident that we are holding our cloud routing footprint and positioning the business to capitalize on this customer sets' rising network requirement. We will continue to innovate, challenge the status quo and deliver new levels of performance, programmability and telemetry to further strengthen our relevance to these important customers.","The enterprise vertical was also a bright spot in the period with revenues growing 4% year-over-year due to strengthened financial services and healthy trends across all technologies. We believe we have a compelling portfolio of enterprise switching, security and orchestration solutions. We continue to strengthen our enterprise offering and view Contrail Enterprise Multicloud as a validation of these efforts, which should bring engineering simplicity to enterprise datacenter environments and establish Juniper as the leader in the field of intent based networking systems.","Service provider revenue was soft in the quarter, declining 16% year-over-year due to seasonality and customer lumpiness. We expect service provider spending to remain sluggish in 2018, but expect to see improved spending levels beyond the March quarter. Despite a slow start to the year, we believe we continue to gain mindshare with our largest service provider customers who are recognizing the value of our nodes slicing feature, software disaggregation, and integrated optical capabilities to meet their core and edge networking requirements.","We believe our efforts should position Juniper to gain share as service providers move forward with metro initiative and 5G build out which could present tailwinds for our business over the next few years.","Now I would like to summarize our performance across routing, switching and security. In routing, our business declined sequentially and year-over-year. While this weakness was seen across product lines, new PTX footprint opportunities within the cloud and MX requirements in the telecom and cable verticals, where service creation remains mission critical, continues to give us confidence in the longer term trajectory for routing portfolio.","In switching, our business declined 1% quarter-over-quarter and 5% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven by seasonality across our key verticals. While our enterprise switching business grew year-over-year, this was offset by lower levels of spending at a few cloud customers, which we had expected.","Based on our pipeline and customer feedback, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our QFX and EX product lines, which we believe remain highly competitive and well positioned to compete across industry verticals, including cloud and hyperscale accounts.","In security, our business declined 17% quarter-over-quarter but grew 11% year-over-year, representing the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We believe more customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection and enforcement against cyber threats. Our Software-Defined Secure Network solution is gaining traction and we've added many new customers in Q1 that are leveraging its benefits. Based on our current pipeline, we remain optimistic that our security business will see year-over-year growth for the full year 2018.","We are making progress with our efforts to capture more software revenue, which has more than doubled over the last three years. We are seeing momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins in the quarter, including a U.S. SaaS provider, and a global strategic enterprise account. We believe we are executing on an extremely compelling product roadmap for Contrail, as highlighted by the recent release of our enhanced enterprise multicloud capabilities, which bring end to end policy and control capabilities for any workload running in physical and virtual environments any cloud and across multi-vendor environments.","These are capabilities that are truly unique in the industry. Additionally, AppFormix continues to gain traction across a widening set of customers with new wins in the service provider and enterprise verticals.","We plan to introduce new software innovations to the portfolio through the course of the year that drive customer efficiencies, enhance the value of our existing hardware platforms and result in more recurring software revenue which should prove accretive to growth and margins.","While the impact of ASC 606 caused our Services business to decline year-over-year, we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services. If not for ASC 606 accounting change, our Service business would have experienced growth year-over-year.","We remain committed to all of our strategic verticals, especially the cloud and believe that we are more relevant than ever to our customers and the industry. We are innovating in ways that truly matter to all network builders and operators that are embracing cloud architecture to drive greater levels of operating efficiency and service agility. I'm very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us.","In summary, while we continued to believe 2018 is likely to be a transition year for Juniper, we are confident that we have the right strategy and solution portfolio needed to win in the market and drive the return to growth by the end of the year. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders.","I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the first quarter were in line with our expectations and were above the midpoint of our guidance for revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP EPS.","The change to the new accounting standard ASC 606 did not materially impact the overall first quarter financial results, and therefore the discussion of our first quarter results will reflect the adoption of ASC 606.","Total first quarter revenue was $1,083 million, non-GAAP gross margin was 58.2% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.28. As we expected, the architectural shifts in the cloud vertical continued, however, cloud revenues were up slightly sequentially and ahead of our expectations.","The service provider vertical was challenged due to the timing of customer deployments, resulting in decreases both year-over-year and sequentially. Enterprise increased 4% year-over-year, due to strengths in all technologies.","Routing and switching both declined year-over-year. However, we continue to see positive momentum in security where we saw a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were cloud, four were service providers and two were enterprises. Of these customers, four were located outside of the United States.","Product and service deferred revenue declined both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of ASC 606, product deferred revenue would have been up approximately 19% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Service deferred revenue would have been up 4% year-over-year and sequentially.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.2%. The result on a year-over-year and sequential basis was largely due to lower revenue, customer and product mix and higher service costs, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. On a year-over-year basis, memory component costs were also a factor.","Non GAAP operating expense was $497 million, a decrease of 2% year-over-year, but an increase of 4% sequentially. The sequential increase reflects the annual reset of variable compensation as well as targeted investments in R&D and sales and marketing, designed to strengthen products and market opportunities that we believe will drive differentiation and create future shareholder value.","Our strong cash flow generation continued, with cash flow from operations of $271 million for the quarter. As we mentioned during our January call, during the first quarter, we initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase program and paid $62 million in dividends. Our total cash, cash equivalents and investment balance at the end of the March quarter was $3.4 billion and we repatriated $2.5 billion during the quarter.","Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our Q2 revenue outlook reflects a return to normal seasonality. While customer spending remains dynamic and difficult to predict, we continue to expect sequential growth through the remainder of the year, with a return to year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter.","For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to improve sequentially due to increased volume and improvements in our cost structure. While we believe better volumes and cost structure efficiency should drive further non-GAAP gross margin improvement during the second half of the year, the pace of this improvement could be offset by mix and other factors. Based on our expected spending levels through the first half of the year, we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat for the full year 2018.","In closing, I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you very much. Before I ask my question, just a quick clarification. I did hear a comment that you expected security to grow for the year. I don't know if you made a similar comment on switching, so just wanted to clarify that.","And let me ask the broader question is, we understand the transition to PTX replacing MX in the cloud vertical. I get a lot of questions about the same transition happening in service providers. And I know some operators like Verizon deployed PTX many years ago. But could you help us understand why we should or should not expect a similar product transition in your service provider vertical? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Simon, thanks for the question. Let me start with the first one around our expectation for security and switching for the year. The indications that we're getting in terms of customer conversations, the strength of the technology, we just had a great RSA conference showing a few weeks ago. The pipeline is looking good, so I do expect security to be a growth driver for us in 2018 all up.","Similar set of commentary around switching. Switching has a degree of customer concentration. And we have talked about the fact that this transition, the cloud does have an impact on switching. But I also mentioned in my opening commentary that we're progressing quite nicely in that transition. And as a result of that I do expect switching to be a growth engine for us in 2018 all up. So security and switching I think will be growth technologies for us in 2018.","As far as the PTX transition, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're making really good progress with now over 80% of the capacity that's being provided to the cloud vertical being PTX oriented. A much smaller number is in the service provider space and that's primarily because of the fact that the use cases and the applications in the service provider space are just not as conducive to a PTX type of architecture. The feature flexibility, the service delivery models and so forth are much more oriented towards the kind of flexibility that the MX provides.","Additionally, we continue to invest in the MX. You can expect that there will be product refresh cycles happening in the MX that will improve the economics of the MX over time and provide telcos with the combination of flexibility, services capability that they need at more and more compelling price points. So for that reason there is going to be some shifting but nowhere near what it is for the cloud vertical in the next couple of years.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead.","Tejas Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. This is Tejas on for Steve. Also on cloud, what was the reason cloud surprised? Is the transition happening faster than you previously expected?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes, it was a little bit faster than what we expected. I mean, we were at the high end of our range all up. So it's not like it was a huge surprise for us, but it's fair to say that we're pleased with the pace of that transition, right? The new architectures are well understood at this point. The certification for the products and the solution is well underway. In some cases, the new deployments have actually already started.","And again as a proof points of that we provided the capacity mix between PTX and the MX. So I think we're just very pleased right now that we are making progress. And the more progress we make, the more confidence we have that we're going to get through this transition throughout the remainder of the year and get back to a year-over-year growth in cloud routing next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Let me just move to the cloud switching part here. Rami, you did mention that it was down in the quarter but it did exceed your expectation. So if you can give us a little color on why cloud switching did a little bit better. Was it 100 gig? Was it new customers? And then the second part of that one, can you talk a little bit about the next transition to 400 gig? When do you see that happening? Do you see that as an opportunity, maybe an insertion point to get better in with the cloud? When could we hear more about that? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Certainly Tim. So switching does have a fair degree of concentration especially in the hyperscale cloud providers where we still have a lot more room to grow over time. And I think the 400 gig transition is one that we're very excited about as an opportunity to go into capture share. We expect that to happen sometime next year. We're very much getting ready for it from the standpoint of the systems that are on our road map, the silicon technology that we have chosen, the optics components that will be required to achieve that 400 gig cycle.","So all up, I actually am quite excited about 400 gig sometime next year as an opportunity for Juniper to take share. And as far as the switching trends in \u2013 that are happening in Q1 and in the next couple of quarters because of the fact that there is a fair degree of customer concentration in switching and because of the fact that this scale up to scale out transition that we've talked a lot about does have a switching element, we're seeing some cyclicality in the business.","I do think that over the next few quarters we should see good solid growth in switching. And all up for 2018, I expect that switching will be up year-over-year. Very confident in the technology across software, silicon and optics that we have in the road map now for our switching product. So this is why I'm actually quite optimistic about switching in 2018.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Hi, guys. I'd like to dig into the gross margin, if I may, if you can quantify the impact, specifically of ASC 606 on gross margin versus other items number one. And number two, the word competition or price pressure isn't mentioned anywhere in the release or your prepared comments. Was that not a factor? Is the pricing environment relatively stable? And how do I think about the potential, what is steady state for you after you get back to volume on gross margins under ASC 606? I'm trying to understand what's the ceiling there.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Let me start actually with the second question around the pricing dynamics, and then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk about the gross margins and any impact with ASC 606. The biggest factor that has impacted pricing has actually been this cloud routing transition from MX to PTX. And as you all know, the PTX price per port is meaningfully lower than that of the MX. As we get through more and more of that transition then I expect there to be more normalization of the ASP compression on a year-over-year basis. I don't think from a competitive standpoint there's anything that's meaningfully different in Q1 versus what we saw last year. As this transition from MX to PTX plays out, I do expect that that headwind associated with price compression will start to alleviate.","And now I'll pass it on to Ken to talk about gross margins.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure. So we are pleased with our gross margin result in Q1, slightly ahead of our midpoint of our guidance. That said, clearly it was down year-on-year and Q-on-Q as we expected it to be. The primary drivers for the decline sequentially would be lower revenue volume, which we talked about a lot last quarter as well as some of the mix issues, both technology mix, routing versus switching as an example, as well as just within routing as we go through this transition.","We talked about the PTX product doesn't quite have the same margin level as MX, still a very good margin product above the Juniper average, but not as margin rich as MX. So those are the primary factors that caused this decline Q-on-Q. Going forward, we expect margin to increase with volume. You can see the Q2 guidance is 59%, so that's up sequentially off of Q1. I do expect it to increase throughout the rest of the year with volume.","That said, the pace of the improvement could vary as mix will definitely be an impact going forward. So I don't expect the mix factor to normalize throughout the rest of the year. Just really the volume factor would be how I'd model that. From a ASC 606 perspective, there's really no change. I mean we had 58.2% in both ASC 605 and ASC 606. So the margin is the same in total. What is different is product versus service. So although revenue was largely unchanged there's just a $2 million difference between old rules and new rules, you did see approximately $29 million more product revenue and $27 million less service revenue. The cost of goods sold for products and cost of goods sold for service were largely the same. So that shift in revenues resulting in more margin for product, less margin for service, but overall not much of an impact.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Good luck guys.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC","Thanks guys. A couple of clarifications and then a question. I'll start with a question. Rami, if I heard you correctly, I forget what you said whether you're expecting weak or a decline in your service provider revenue. I'm just wondering what are the underlying drivers of the disconnect between the calendar 2018 outlook versus service provider CapEx, especially wireline in your expectations. What's driving that?","And then Ken, I was hoping for a clarification in terms of -- on the previous question. Is it too early to talk about what you could return to in terms of peak operating, peak gross margin once you get by -- once you get fully by this architectural transition issue? And finally, do you all still -- I think previously you all had indicated that you expect to win a hyperscale cloud customer related to switching by the end of calendar 2018. Is that still the expectation? Thanks guys.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Paul, thanks for the questions. So let me start with the service provider question. The factors that are affecting service provider have largely remained consistent over the last several quarters. Service providers are experiencing top line pressure. There is consolidation in this space. They are really thinking hard about how it is that they're going to move towards cloud-oriented architectures. And Q1 I think was especially challenging for Juniper because we had a couple of large telco customers, especially in North America, that just didn't spend as much as they have historically done.","I do expect based on timing of projects, conversations we're having with them that we should see a recovery throughout this year. But it will remain a challenged environment I think for the next year or two. There are some potential catalysts that come our way for service providers. One of them is the conversations now especially on the heels of Mobile World Congress that took place earlier this year around 5G are really increasing. And that's going to require an investment in metro infrastructure to carry the increased capacity level that 5G will drive.","It's also very much a cloud-native technology. So we are starting to see, and I would say, especially now in EMEA, an increased number of level of projects oriented around telco cloud that, I think, we are well set up to capture with our Contrail solutions.","On the last question about hyperscale, I don't think we talked about any specific timing. In fact, we knew as we entered into the switching space that it would be easier for us to go after the Tier 2 cloud providers, the SaaS providers and the enterprise. And we've seen really solid momentum there that resulted in 25% year-over-year growth for the QFX last year.","Hyperscalers are just going to take a little bit more time. We already have some presence in the hyperscalers switching use cases and opportunities, but there's a lot more for us to do. I do think 400-gig presents us with the next big opportunity that we're gearing up for.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. On the gross margin question, we continue to focus on innovation and value engineering as well as optimizing our supply chain, pricing discipline and increasing our software mix as well. So there's a lot of company initiatives to drive gross margin up.","Quite honestly, at this point it is too early to call 2019. We are looking to have an Analyst Day or Investor Day later in the year where we'll provide more long term color and update, our long term model. But right now the focus on growing gross margin sequentially as volume grows throughout FY 2018.","And to that point, I wouldn't \u2013 we're not going to provide full year guidance. But I would encourage you to maintain your revenue and EPS assumptions for the second half that you currently have in your models and that would apply to gross margin as well.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC","Hey, Rami, can I just clarify something? I'm not challenging your characterization of the carrier environment. But when you look at carriers' plans for spend this year, it actually is the best year in quite some time in the last eight or nine years, especially wireline.","You're looking at a 5-plus-percent growth outlook. And I'm just wondering is there anything \u2013 in terms of the product market itself, I would think routing would do that much better. But is there anything going on? Are you just being appropriately conservative? Or is there something else underlying the disconnect in the guidance with that particular routing customers?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Paul, we see the same CapEx reports that you see. And they don't \u2013 carriers, they're not always that clear about how they're going to be investing the CapEx dollars that they talk about as part of their plans. So, again, I would say, we're being cautious and prudent in terms of their spend levels, but we are very much viewing this as an extremely important vertical for us.","And we're going to be ready to capture any routing opportunities or telco cloud opportunities with the innovations that we're putting into the market with our carriers. I will say, again, coming out of Mobile World Congress in Q1 of this year, I think, the relationships that we have with our major telco customers worldwide have never been stronger.","Operator","Our next question is from Tal Liani from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Hi, guys. I want to go back to the question about carrier routing. Number one is, what do you make of AT&T use of 60,000 white box routers? How does that impact your position in the space? Why don't we see them taking more branded solutions versus white boxes? And is this something that we've seen on the switching side with Arista and they managed to play still in the white box market through software? How are you planning to participate? And is there a room for you to play and participate in the white box market? So that's number one.","The second thing is about the hyperscale LAN opportunity not the WAN opportunity. So far you've been mostly presence \u2013 you had presence in the kind of WAN side. And the question is what about the LAN side? Any of your technical progress, any of your new products that address this opportunity better than before? Or what needs to happen for you to participate there? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks for the questions. So on white box, I believe very strongly that we are innovating in ways that set us up to be very relevant to those that are moving towards white box type solutions. I do also believe that there aren't that many white box type opportunities, especially in the wide area. But to the extent that these become more of a factor, I do think that we are quite frankly leaders in this space.","We were the first truly established network technology vendor that disaggregated our operating system. I think many of our customers whether they be telecom operators or cloud providers that are looking at white box are looking to achieve levels of flexibility, new levels of flexibility, programmability and telemetry. And in all of these areas we have disaggregated with a view on solving the specific requirements from our customers.","So I don't want to comment about any one customer, but I will say that we're well equipped and well-positioned to participate in the disaggregation capabilities that some of our customers are currently seeking and asking from us.","On hyperscale LAN and you're, I'm assuming you're talking about hyperscale datacenter, you're absolutely right that our market share in cloud routing is meaningfully ahead of our market share in cloud, and especially hyperscale cloud switching. We have already made some progress in switching opportunities inside of the hyperscale cloud providers but there is a lot more that we can do.","We've learned a significant amount from the introduction of our QFX product line over the last year or two. And now have, yes, a product and solution and technology plan in place across routing, across silicon technology and across optics that I think only increase our ability to penetrate the hyperscale datacenter in the incoming years.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Hey, good afternoon. Yeah, hi, Rami, Ken.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Hello.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. My question, I was just reflecting on your prepared comments the \u2013 some of the service provider routing opportunities is kind of delayed by some timing. I'm just curious from a customer point of view, when you talk to some of your bigger telco, cable customers, for example, what's holding them back? What's the timing? Is it some architectural transition? Is it 5G? I want to better understand the timing comment on the prepared comments. Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. I mean, it really is just a matter of projects typically go through their typical cycles where there is a period of time where they are doing the solution development and the design, the engineering, and then there is a period of time where they're deploying. And Q1 at least for a couple of our largest telco customers, ended up being a bit more of a pause for them. So I don't think there's anything sort of macro level beyond the factors that I've already talked about earlier, it's just really a matter of the timing of where they are with these projects. And it's specific to a few customers.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, I would just add. I mean, Q1 is seasonally a weak quarter for us, from a telco perspective. And what, as Rami mentioned, in this particular quarter, we did see some of our larger customers not deploy. And as you know, we have a fairly high customer concentration in the telco and we have a deployment based revenue model. So it does have impacts to our 90 day results more pronounced than other verticals, and that's what happened in this quarter. It's not something that's really macro related. It's really more Juniper specific.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Certainly, and a quick follow-up for you Ken is OpEx as a percentage of revenue, I mean obviously lots of things are happening here in the horizon 5G etcetera. How should we think about OpEx as a percentage of revenues in the next few quarters? Thanks.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So we're going to remain prudent on OpEx. That said, we're also going to make sure we invest in right areas to grow long term revenue growth and expand profits. You can see the guide of OpEx for Q2 is the $490 million level, so down off of Q1 levels.","I also mentioned in my commentary that I expect OpEx for the full year to be approximately flat. So we believe a flat OpEx for us would be enough for us to invest in the right areas to make sure we focus on long term growth and long term profit.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead. I am sorry, Jim, your line is live. Perhaps you could be on mute by accident. And we'll move on, our next is from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Balaji on behalf of Rod. Two questions, if I could. In the cloud routing opportunities that you're talking about right now, the ASPs are clearly coming down significantly. So what sort of growth are you targeting to be able to offset that?","I recognize that it's expected to grow by the end of the year. But do you think that you can get revenues back into the neighborhood of where you were in the last couple of years? And then a follow-on question on service provider, if you could comment specifically on pricing within that vertical that would be helpful? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks for the questions. So on the cloud transition, as I mentioned, we are on or ahead of where we expect to be right now on that transition. A lot of that transition is behind us. There's still more to go as we go through the rest of this year. The more of the transition is in the rearview mirror, with respect to MX and PTX, the more normalization we'll see in ASP compression, right, because the bulk of the ASP pressure comes from the transition from an MX with a certain price per port down to a PTX with a lower price per port.","The math starts to work in our favor next year, assuming nothing is different next year for the kinds of port growth that cloud providers are seeing this year and have seen historically.","As you know, many of the cloud providers have reported their numbers. They're not seeing any slowdown in their business. Their need to support their customers, from a service delivery experience, is it remains very important. So I truly do believe that this remains a very important and a growth vertical for us that we'll be very much focused on.","Pricing in the service provider space, I don't think there's anything out of the normal. It's honestly business as usual. We talked about some of the macro factors around transition to cloud architectures and consolidation and the customer concentration. But from a pricing dynamics it's business as usual.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","It remains a challenging environment, but really no change from previous quarters.","Operator","Our next question is from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. One clarification and one question. First, in your cloud segment, you said it's up 4% sequentially, mostly because of routing. But at the same time you're also saying that PTX is down sequentially. So I'm just trying to reconcile that. Is the growth still coming from MX? And if so, how sustainable that is?","And then Rami, you talked a little bit about the enterprise and financial verticals being relatively healthy on the switching side. If you could give us a bit more color as to what's driving that? Is that an upgrade cycle, or is it just the environment being a little bit healthier? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, let me start with your question around enterprise, and then I'll ask Ken to comment on your first question. What we saw in enterprise is strength in our federal vertical, financial services. Certain geos as well like Australia was actually a good market for us in the Q1 timeframe. I think we're leading with a software oriented cloud based solution. And that's leading to a good ability for us to position our switching, our routing, and our security. And the fact is, as you saw, the security actually was a good performer for us in the Q1 timeframe.","We announced just a few weeks ago, a solution that helps enterprises solve the problem that is top of mind for most CIOs that I talk to, which is the ability to move to a multicloud environment with ease and with peace of mind on security, and that's exactly what Contrail Enterprise Multicloud seeks to solve for our customers.","We've also complemented the solutions and the technology with a go to market motion where we are specifically targeting new logos and especially large enterprise logos. And I think all of this effort is coming to bear in some good results that we've seen now over the last couple of quarters. And I expect \u2013 I'm quite optimistic about enterprise for the rest of the year as a result.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, and on the first question, so the cloud vertical was up sequentially. PTX was up year-over-year but down sequentially. The difference is the PTX was up within the cloud but it was down with the service provider space. So if you look at PTX, we still sell a fair amount to both service provider and cloud. The cloud vertical was up for PTX sequentially and the service provider vertical was down sequentially for PTX.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I just want to follow-up on the security question firstly. Can you talk a little bit \u2013 it seems like you're getting good combination of results of targeting new customers and with your new portfolio. Can you talk a little bit about what (00:42:39) most of those new customers, is it specifically the opportunity or abilities around multicloud, or just elaborate that a little bit?","And then my second question is related to M&A. You've mentioned a couple of times that you're looking at places to invest, et cetera. How should we think about (00:43:00) may factor into your investment plans? Thank you very much.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","I appreciate the question. In security, what I liked about our results is that they were fairly broad based in nature across our technologies and our use cases. So we've now refreshed our mid range portfolio and started to see momentum there. We've refreshed our brands portfolio and seeing good momentum there. We also saw good high-end momentum, primarily as a result of cloud customers. We're seeing also a nice diversity of use case between data centers and next generation firewall. And the million dollar plus opportunities that we track are growing nicely. And the last thing, I'd say about security is we're seeing good software attach. The layer four to seven software attach, which we track closely, which is, I think, a good sign of the value that we're offering to our customers is growing now on a year-over-year basis. I do expect based on the pipeline that we're seeing that we should see full year growth for security.","On the M&A side, we primarily look for an organic approach to our innovation but at the same time we have good healthy balance sheet. We're generating cash and we would look for opportunities to accelerate our strategy, especially around the cloud, around the enterprise cloud and so on. So there is an opportunity for value enhancing strategy accelerating M&A. We view that as fair game to consider.","Operator","Our next question is from James Fish from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, guys. Thanks for the question and good quarter. Just curious as to what you're seeing related to SD-WAN today and how we should think about the impact throughout the year and kind of moving forward. And then secondly just kind of making sure we're dotting our i's and crossing our t's, was there any pull forward of the switching business this quarter?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Let me address the first question about SD-WAN. So we view the SD-WAN opportunity as a fantastic opportunity. But we actually look at SD-WAN a little bit different than most of our peers out in the industry. We look at SD-WAN as a very important feature or element of a broader solution around cloud CPE, where we're offering not just an easy managed solution for connectivity but also one that offers security embedded and the ability to leverage third-party virtual network function.","We are initially targeting our service provider customers as a way of enabling them to go after the SD-WAN market opportunity. That way we get to leverage the great relationships we have with our service providers. We also can leverage their go-to-market muscle that can complement our own in going after the enterprise end users.","This year is really around wins and deployments. And we have, I believe, I mentioned in the last earnings call now three major telco wins. And we are in the process of deploying the solutions, so that we can take it to market by the end of the year and start seeing some revenue growth next year. I think it's early days in terms of SD-WAN. I know it gets a lot of press and attention, but it's still in the beginning stages of the total opportunity and we're excited about it. I think we start to see some revenue from it in a meaningful way next year.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. On your second question, we don't believe there's any pull into Q1 from a switching perspective. In fact, I do believe switching will grow sequentially from Q1 levels throughout the year and return to full year growth in the second half of FY 2018. And again it should be a full year growth FY 2018 over FY 2017. So we see the switching momentum only improving throughout the rest of the year.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Dmitry Netis from William Blair. Please go ahead. I'm sorry. Dmitry, your line is live. Perhaps, you could be muted.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, I apologize for that. Can you hear me okay now?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking this question, Rami and Ken, appreciate it. So a multipart question, if I may, here. First on the sales transition or the Head of Sales transition, can you give us an update where you are on that search and whether or not there's some key sales departures that you've been witnessing in the process or not? That would be sort of one topic I wanted to touch on.","Secondly, you mentioned you repatriated $2.5 billion in cash out of the $3.4 billion. So how much cash is still sitting overseas, and whether there was any urgency in this repatriation as you kind of look into the M&A spectrum? Or is this you're just being opportunistic?","And then lastly, if I may, kind of beating the dead horse again on price pressure. I know you noted there's no significant change from prior quarter. It's always been tough, et cetera, in the service provider market. But I wanted to ask the question specifically as it relates to CommScope, which reported earlier this morning, and had noted some commodity price increases and specific price pressure from North American carriers across mobility and connectivity businesses, and whether you could see anything incremental from that standpoint as it relates to your business? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Hey, thanks Dmitry for the questions. First on your question around Head of Sales, I think we're in the middle of the process right now. There's not much I can really say about it other than the fact that we have a great set of sales executives, fantastic bench strength. Our existing Head of Sales, Vince Molinaro is seeing -- is making sure to see that there is an orderly transition. So I'm quite pleased with the progress that we're making and expect it to be a smooth transition to a new Head of Sales when we identify that individual.","And as part of your second question around pricing pressure, stand by what we said already. There is nothing out of the ordinary from a service provider standpoint in terms of the pricing dynamics. In the cloud space, the biggest factor is just the mix as we go from MX to PTX. And that subsides as we go through the rest of the transition that we see ahead for us. But in the ASP space again no new news there.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes, on the tax question, we did repatriate $2.5 billion in Q1. We still have 35% of our cash offshore, so roughly $1.2 billion is offshore. We expect to repatriate another $500 million or so late this year or early next. From an urgency perspective I wouldn't call it urgent. I think it's just good business practice to bring it back onshore. We did pay the full tax liability for all of our offshore cash in Q4 last year, so from a tax perspective that's behind us on the expense side. And just bringing it onshore just gives us more flexibility, but I wouldn't categorize it as urgent for any sort of pending M&A or anything. It's really just more good hygiene.","Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks for all your questions. That concludes today's call. Excellent!

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lubert, you may begin.","Jess Lubert","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-K, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.","Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company\u2019s financial results is included in today\u2019s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. The June quarter came in largely as we had expected. Total revenue of $1,102 million were towards the midpoint of our guidance and in line with normal seasonal trends for the June quarter. We experienced sequential growth across all verticals and technologies with a notable sequential improvement in our cloud vertical, which stabilized on a year-over-year basis.","Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 came in a $0.01 above the midpoint of our forecast, as strong cost controls more than offset the impact from the recent increase in China tariffs and a higher non-GAAP tax rate in the period.","The first-half of 2019 played out largely as we expected and we are seeing healthy momentum in several areas of our business, which is providing confidence in our ability to not only deliver sequential revenue growth through the remainder of the year, but also a return to year-over-year revenue growth during the December quarter.","Now I\u2019d like to walk you through some of the highlights of the quarter and some of the items driving our confidence for the rest of the year. We experienced improved trends within our cloud business during the June quarter, due to an acceleration of some wide area deployments, which had previously been proceeding at a slower rate.","While our cloud business is likely to remain lumpy on a go-forward basis and maybe down sequentially during the September quarter, current momentum is healthy and we feel good about the outlook of this business, especially now that the MX to PTX transition is largely behind us.","We continue to believe we are holding our footprints in our cloud customers wide area networks and our position to grow with their capacity requirements in the segments. While cloud wide area spending trends should present growth opportunities for us over the next few years, we are very much focused on leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture new use cases in the hyperscale market, particularly in the data center interconnect and spine-and-leaf Switching segments.","On this last point, we have not only begun shipping our first merchant and custom silicon-based 400-gig capable product, but also introduced a cloud optimized version of Junos that we believe offers superior programmability, modularity and open API support needed to win the footprint we are targeting.","We plan to introduce additional 400-gig capable products through the course of this year and next, and we believe we will further strengthen our ability to win new hyperscale use cases, or even a modest level of success to present material tailwind for our business in the years to come.","We are continuing to see very healthy trends in the enterprise business. While our Q2 enterprise revenue declined 6% year-over-year, this is largely a function of timing as our enterprise bookings increased double-digit sequentially and 12% year-over-year, with sequential and year-over-year growth across all technologies, and we were able to build backlog on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis.","We believe we have the right product and strategy to win in the enterprise market and remain confident this vertical will grow for the year. This confidence is being fueled by the strength of our data center and campus offering, which we believe are differentiated and positioned to win in the market.","In the data center, we believe the combination of Contrail Enterprise Multi-cloud and our QFX switches offer a compelling value proposition for customers looking to move from single-vendor private cloud environments to a multi-vendor multi-cloud state. These trends are beginning to play out in the market now and should accelerate in the years to come.","The value of our data center strategy is resonating in the market and Gartner for a second year in a row named Juniper as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networking. We are also confident that we are very well-positioned in the enterprise campus and branch market.","With the acquisition of Mist Systems, we are now one of only two industry players that can offer a full portfolio of enterprise Wi-Fi switching, routing, security and SD-WAN solution.","We believe our AI for enterprise capabilities are truly differentiated and that we are well-positioned to benefit as the industry transitions to Wi-Fi 6 over the next several years. The Mist acquisition is proceeding well with strong field engagement and early wins providing optimism for our acquisition.","In addition to maintaining a comprehensive campus and branch portfolio that brings differentiated AI, cloud management and security capabilities, I also want to highlight that we maintain a large established channel, a dedicated enterprise sales force where we are investing and more than 15,000 established enterprise customers, many of which we believe can be further monetized with these new solutions like SD-WAN and Mist.","We believe these attributes differentiate us from our peers and should enable us to gain share in the years to come. We are continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 17% year-over-year and accounted for more than 10% of revenue during the June quarter. This strength was driven by a combination of on-box and off-box offerings.","While our success may not be linear, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time, especially as subscription-based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market.","Finally, we are continuing to see strength in our services business, which grew 2% year-over-year and accounted for 35% of our overall revenue. Our service team continues to execute well driving strong service attach rates and renewals.","While not a surprise, our service provider business remains challenge. We believe our service provider relationships remain strong and the weakness we\u2019re seeing is tied to our customers business model pressures and the expected timing of project deployments.","Despite these challenges, we do expect our service provider business to experience better sequential trends during the second-half of the year, based on our current pipeline of known opportunity. With the availability of our new MX 5G line cards, the strength of our Contrail orchestration platform and our partnership with Ericsson, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on our service provider customers 5G and telco cloud initiative, which could begin to start playing out later this year.","I think it\u2019s worth highlighting that we have begun to shift several important new products. While these platforms will take time to work through customer qualifications, they should strengthen our competitive position across our service provider, cloud and enterprise markets.","Some of these include new MX 5G line cards that enhance our ability to capitalize on the service provider capacity requirements, new QFX switches and PTX routing platforms designed to capitalize on customer 400-gig upgrades, enhanced Contrail Enterprise Multi-cloud software capabilities that breaks down the barriers of incumbency and make moving to a multi-vendor, multi-cloud state a reality with increased simplicity and reduced cost, and new SD-WAN capabilities to enhance our ability to penetrate enterprise campus and branch opportunities.","We believe 5G, the 400-gig upgrade cycle, SD-WAN, Wi-Fi 6 and enterprise multi-cloud initiatives, each represent large multi-year opportunities, where we should be well-positioned to benefit over the next few years.","Importantly, I would like to note that I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with our sales transformation. The changes we have made are already starting to yield benefits in the form of improved sales productivity and enhanced level of confidence in the pipeline driving our forecasts.","We are now in the process of adding more quota-carrying sales headwinds to the field. While it is likely to take these new reps at least a few quarters to achieve full productivity, we do expect them to start contributing during the second-half of the year, with a further ramp in coverage and productivity that should present additional tailwind through the 2020.","Based on these dynamics, I remain confidence in our ability to deliver sequential revenue growth during the second-half of the year and a return to year-over-year revenue growth during the December quarter. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders.","I will now turn over the call to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.","Ken Miller","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. Second quarter revenue of $1,102 million was an increase of 10% sequentially and in line with our guidance. As expected, we saw sequential revenue growth across all verticals and all technologies.","Looking at our revenue by vertical, Cloud increased 28%, Enterprise increased 8% and Service Provider increased 3% sequentially. From a technology perspective, Routing increased 11%, Switching increased 22% and Security increased 20% sequentially.","On a year-over-year basis, Service Provider declined 15%, Cloud was flat and Enterprise declined 6%. Although enterprise revenue decreased year-over-year, our bookings increased double digits versus last year. As Rami mentioned, we are pleased with our momentum and success in the enterprise vertical.","Our services business continue to grow posting growth of 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due to strong renewals and attach rates of support contracts. Software revenue was a highlight growing year-over-year and was greater than 10% of total revenue.","In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Service Provider and one was an Enterprise. We had one customer from the cloud vertical that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in the second quarter.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2%, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to the increase in China tariffs from 10% to 25%. Overall, non-GAAP operating expenses were down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due to lower headcount-related cost and improving operating expense management.","Headcount was slightly down sequentially, primarily as a result of outsourcing IT services to IBM, which was partially offset by the acquisition of Mist Systems and additional hires in our go-to-market organization. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.40, a $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance.","Looking at our balance sheet. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the second quarter were $2.9 billion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the cash outflows associated with the acquisition of Mist Systems and our recent accelerated share repurchase program or ASR.","We generated cash flow from operations of $89 million for the second quarter. The primary reasons for the sequential decline despite stronger net income, where lower cash collections and timing of working capital related to supplier payments. We expect to see stronger cash generation in the second-half of 2019. As part of our ongoing capital return program, we paid $66 million in dividends and entered into a $300 million ASR.","Before we move onto Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find details in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our second-half revenue outlook reiterates the commentary we stated previously, which reflects our expectation for above normal seasonal trends and a return to growth in the fourth quarter, due to our current pipeline of opportunities, as well as the expected positive impact from our go-to-market transformation activities. I like to reiterate our confidence in the long-term financial model we outlined at our Investor Day in November last year.","Full-year non-GAAP gross margin is expected to continue to be pressured by China tariffs. I\u2019m proud of our team as we\u2019ve been able to mitigate the vast majority of potential impact of the China tariffs. Despite these ongoing mitigation efforts, the increase in tariffs from 10% to 25% is expected to have a 30 to 50 basis point impact on full-year non-GAAP gross margin.","We plan to manage our operating expenses prudently. However, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating expenses on a full-year basis to be flat to slightly up versus 2018, inclusive of the acquisition of Mist Systems.","In the second quarter of 2019, we adopted a full-year projected tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. For the remainder of 2019, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19.5%.","Due to the increased China tariffs and a higher non-GAAP tax rate, we now expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings per share to be at the low-end of the previously stated range of $1.75 per share plus or minus $0.05.","In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success.","Now I\u2019d like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Silverstein, Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Silverstein","I appreciate you for taking the question, guys. Two quick questions. One, I know it\u2019s hard to discern how much of an improvement is due to macro and how much is improved competitive stance from execution? But that said, can you take a crack and get response to that question? And then I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up.","Rami Rahim","Okay. Hey, Paul, thanks for the question. I think the improvement in cloud is very much based on the fact that we are now through the big product transition that we\u2019ve been talking about now for a year from MX to PTX. As a result of that, the blended pricing is now at a much more normalized level. And as we have been seeing, we\u2019ll see a recovery in that business based on the pace at which deployments happen in the routing space within the vertical and, in particular, in the hyperscale part of that vertical.","In the enterprise, the strong year-over-year bookings and the sequential performance in that business, I believe that the combination of robust spending in the enterprise space, which we\u2019re taking advantage of, but certainly also a very strong product portfolio that spans both the data center, as well as the campus and branch. And, in particular, in the campus and branch now where we have the combination of a really strong portfolio in the wired switching space and now with what I believe to be the best wireless LAN solution with Mist Systems. So we\u2019re certainly benefiting from that.","In the service provider space, it\u2019s really more of the same in terms of some of the market dynamics, but it\u2019s a challenging environment. We expect it to remain challenging for sometime, but there are some catalysts there over the long-term around 5G that can certainly help.","Paul Silverstein","Rami, on the \u2013 on your responses on the cloud and enterprise, first, on the cloud. The MX \u2013 the PTX transition was a while ago, and since then, you\u2019ve been commenting that the volumes haven\u2019t come in. What\u2019s changed now, especially given that when a lot of us look at the CapEx trends in cloud, obviously, they\u2019re not what they were last year, albeit there have been some crosscurrents. What do you think it\u2019s changing as it relates to your product portfolio? And then on the enterprise, when you talk about strength and in demand, is that pretty uniform across the major geos, or is it particular in the U.S. or other markets?","Rami Rahim","Yes. So on the \u2013 in the cloud space, now what we\u2019re seeing is essentially a reacceleration of some of the routing deployments among some of our largest cloud customers that we have benefited from. I expect that, we\u2019re going to see a continued recovery over the next few years in the cloud routing space, primarily because of the fact that their businesses are doing very well.","And in order to continue to support their businesses, they\u2019re going to need to invest in their network infrastructure. In order to get to even better performance in the cloud vertical, we\u2019re very focused on net new footprint and use cases, especially as it in the switching space for data center interconnect and spine-and-leaf.","In the enterprise, we saw really great strength in the government space internationally, but especially here in the U.S. And I think Europe and the U.S., in particular, were strong for us in the enterprise beyond government, right, and larger enterprise banks financials and the mid range of the market, which obviously spans many different verticals. Again, I do think that the spending environment there remains fairly robust and we\u2019re taking advantage of that. And I believe our technology roadmap and the products we have in the market are really strong.","Ken Miller","Yes. Just to add on the cloud space, I agree that the PTX transition is largely behind us and I would say that the cloud vertical has largely stabilized. That said, any given 90-day period, you\u2019re going to see some lumpiness in our quarter-to-quarter revenue, based just on customer deployments. In fact, I would expect Q3 to be down slightly off of this very positive Q2 result. I do think the second-half will be largely in line or largely stable to the first-half, but I do think sequential decline in Q3 is expected.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Leopold, Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Simon Leopold","Thank you. I wanted to see if maybe you could drill down a little bit more on your thoughts on the 400-gig Ethernet switch opportunity. I think there might be some confusion about the opportunity as it relates to timing, given the limited availability of the optics going into the switches. It sounds like that market is beginning without the optics. If you could maybe help us understand how to think about the trajectory there? And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Rami Rahim","Yes, thanks for the question, Simon. So you are right. I think, the market opportunity for the 400-gig capable product starts before the availability of 400-gig optics, primarily because many of these products are actually, in fact, capable of supporting both 100-gig denser 100-gig configurations, as well as 400-gig.","As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have our first set of platforms, a custom silicon-based platform and a merchant silicon-based platform, both of which support dense 400-gig, but even denser 100-gig configurations. Those are now being tested by our customers and we are essentially competing for net new footprint.","The ramps in terms of meaningful revenue contribution really won\u2019t start until the 400-gig optics become available. I expect that to happen in first-half to middle of next year. And then keep in mind that we do have an investment that\u2019s happening in the silicon photonics space that enables us to become masters of our own destiny in terms of providing the types of 400-gig optics, which we believe will have superior economic value propositions in order to support our 400-gig systems and software roadmap that will see light of day over the next couple of quarters.","Simon Leopold","Yes. So that was actually \u2013 my follow-up is, if you could give us an update on the silicon photonics efforts, given last quarter, you had talked about not focusing on 100, so that you could put your energy into a 400-gig product. I\u2019d appreciate just an update of the progress and timeline for availability of 400-gig optics from Juniper?","Rami Rahim","Yes, certainly. So you\u2019re right. We explained, described a change in strategy around our silicon photonics effort. We were primarily using 100-gig as a way to learn. As you know, this is a new area of of innovation for us, and there are always going to be lessons learned whenever you\u2019re sort of charting new territory.","We have diverted focus on the 400-gig. The lessons that we\u2019ve learned in the 100-gig effort have already been applied to our 400-gig effort. I remain optimistic about the opportunity and our ability to introduce into the market 400-gig optics in the first-half of next year, which will be perfectly timed with what we believe to be the ramp within our customers for 400-gig networks.","I do think that we\u2019ll have optics that will have a superior economic value proposition, superior power profile that is obviously very meaningful to all of our customers, but especially our cloud customers. There is still some risk, because again, this is a new innovation area for us. But with every passing month and the lessons that we\u2019ve learned, I believe that we have mitigated \u2013 we\u2019re mitigating more and more of the risk. So at this point, I\u2019m quite optimistic of our ability to deliver on the roadmap.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Kvaal, Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Thank you very much. I would love to dial into that 400-gig in cloud overlap a little bit more. It sounds like you are shipping some of these items, and it seems as though cloud is going well. Are you suggesting that you\u2019ve actually won some 400-gig footprint now, or are these shipments primarily going into trials for the moment?","Rami Rahim","We are primarily in the trial phase of the 400-gig cycle right now. So in some cases, those are in labs, in some cases, we\u2019ve actually seen some very early sort of limited production type of testing that is happening. And this is the time in which we engage with our customers to make sure that we\u2019re tucked and tied across the entire innovation stack from our new software capabilities and with our cloud-oriented Junos software that we\u2019ve now introduced into the market and the new systems, and it\u2019s looking good. It\u2019s still early days, but I have to say that the feedback from our customers is very encouraging.","We still got a lot of execution ahead of us. But based on what we\u2019ve seen from a competitive standpoint, the products that have been in the roadmap for sometime, the feedback that we\u2019re getting from our customers, the early testing that we\u2019re doing, I think we\u2019re in good shape to be able to take some net new footprint, which has always been the strategy.","Ken Miller","Yes, and just to clarify, the Q2 results in cloud had very little impact with 400-gig. We are starting to ship getting into trials, getting into testing labs, et cetera. But the revenue that we posted in Q2 was really more of our typical revenue pairs [ph] we have from the cloud vertical, not 400-gig-related.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Okay. That makes sense, Ken. Thank you. How long do you think it will be before some of these items actually make it out of production testing into actual shipments that you would then be able to talk about with us?","Rami Rahim","I think that the volume shipments will largely be based on the availability of 400-gig optics, which is in the first-half of next year. The activities are happening now and the awards are going to happen over the next couple of quarters. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re absolutely focused on right now is essentially proving ourselves, so that we can get a real crack at net new footprints. And as I mentioned, I think, we\u2019re in good shape to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roy, UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roy","Great, thank you. Rami, you obviously are very optimistic about the back-half. I wonder if you could give us a little more color on what of the number of things you see happening in the back-half are really giving you the confidence maybe in rank order? It\u2019d be good, if you could give us, helpful?","Rami Rahim","Certainly, John. So I think there are a number of factors. First is just the timing of build-outs among our customers, especially in the service provider space, where we have visibility into some projects that are happening in the back-half that will contribute to the momentum in that vertical. I do think if you see our performance in the enterprise, exiting the first-half of the year, where we build some good backlog, I think, that momentum is solid and will certainly contribute to the second-half.","The investments that we have been making in the sales organization where we have undertaken a fairly significant and somewhat difficult transformation, the hard work of the transformation effort is now behind us. And it really is now around investing in net new quota-carrying sales or reps that will take time to become productive. And I think by the time we get to the sort of Q4 timeframe and into next year, certainly, I do believe that they will contribute meaningfully to our momentum all up.","I will also add the innovation cycle. So we\u2019ve announced a number of new products and, in fact, introduced a number of products into the market. So the MX 5G, for example, net new line cards that triple the performance and capacity of those platforms, those are now in customer trials. They\u2019re being tested. And I think that will start to contribute in the second-half of the year. Mist, our software efforts around enterprise, multi-cloud connectivity will start to payoff increasingly near the second-half of the year.","The last thing I will mention is just about forecasting rigor, which has been a real focus of ours as a function of this sales transformation effort. We\u2019ve really added more emphasis on our ability to improve forecasting and predictability. And so all of these factors together, I think, is what\u2019s contributing to the confidence we have in the second-half of the year.","John Roy","Great. It\u2019s very helpful. And one other final question, you were talking about you\u2019re holding your share, or at least your footprint you think in the cloud. Are you seeing any other share changes in any of the other areas? Obviously, you expect share gains in the back-half, I would think. But could you give us any color on the quarter\u2019s possible share changes?","Rami Rahim","Well, you\u2019re right. We believe that the strategy that we have been embarking on of proactively taking our customers from the MX product line to the PTX product line in areas where it makes sense to do so has achieved the net goal that we were after, which is to maintain that footprint. We don\u2019t believe that we have been displaced from any of the networks where we have that strength.","I think the next opportunity for share shift will happen in the 400-gig cycle. And that just goes back to the commentary I just provided around the trial, the proof-of-concept testing that is happening right now. The words that I believe will start to happen over the next couple of quarters. And then ultimately, the deployments that will result in potential share shift from a revenue standpoint in the first-half and sort of middle of next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Yun, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Yun","Hey, guys. I just had a question on 400-gig and the optics as well, particularly as it relates to your go-to-market. So I know you highlighted sort of like the engineered partnerships with some of the large cloud \u2013 to large cloud guys and building the custom silicon. But with Cisco\u2019s kind of intent to purchase Acacia, does that change any of the competitive dynamics in 400-gig?","Rami Rahim","Yes, thanks for the question, Brian. On your question about Acacia, Acacia is a relatively small technology provider for us. So I don\u2019t expect that to impact us in anyway than there are alternative sources for the kinds of products that we were buying from Acacia.","From a 400-gig cycle and go-to-market, the first customers that will consume 400-gig, we believe will be the cloud providers and that will be followed up by the service providers. In the cloud space, we have everything we need from a go-to-market standpoint. And you\u2019re right, there is the sales effort that we put into our cloud provider vertical, but just as importantly is the engineering effort.","In fact, often our best sales people in the cloud vertical are our engineers that are developing the software, the systems, the optics that ultimately make their way into those networks. That engagement model is something that we\u2019re very comfortable with. We\u2019re very used to because of the strengths that we hold in the routing space. We\u2019re just now extending that sales model and the engineering engagements across new footprint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Rod Hall","Yes. Hi, guys, thanks for the question. I just wanted to revisit the question of second-half drivers, I guess, in the context of the service provider vertical being so weak this quarter. And then what I keep hearing you guys say, I got this service providers, kind of at the top end of the list of drivers. I think you said that last quarter as well. And so, can you just juxtapose those two things for us and let us know kind of what you\u2019re thinking in terms of visibility and is \u2013 what you\u2019re seeing this quarter kind of consistent with what you had expected to see? And then I have a follow-up?","Rami Rahim","Yes. Sure, Rod. So in the service provider vertical, I think, it\u2019s more of the same in terms of market dynamics that we have been calling out now for a number of quarters. The service \u2013 many of our service provider customers are under business model challenges. And as a result of that, there\u2019s consolidation. There are all sorts of distractions. There\u2019s also investment priorities around RAN and spectrum purchases and so forth that we have anticipated will impact this part of our business for sometime.","There are sort of catalysts and even some green shoots that I do think will play out over the next few years around 5G, around our partnership effort with Ericsson, around our telco cloud momentum that we are seeing in the market, some of the portfolio enhancements that we\u2019re making around the metro and mobile backhaul, which is very much aligned with the 5G growth.","So I \u2013 we still expect that service provider all up for 2019 is going to be down on a year-over-year basis. What we\u2019re calling out is, if I \u2013 if we take a look at the pipeline, the specific opportunities that we see in front of us, the second-half of the year will be better than the first-half of the year. That\u2019s really the extent of the commentary that we\u2019ve made around the remainder of this year.","Rod Hall","Okay. Thank you, Rami. I appreciate that. And then, Ken, I just had modeling question, the days payable jumped down a lot and I know you\u2019ve made a comment in the prepared remarks. But could you just revisit that comment and maybe go into a little bit more detail about why days payable was such a big change for the quarter?","Rami Rahim","Yes. So it really just has to do with the timing and how we\u2019ve landed in a quarter. There was nothing intentional about the timing from our payable side. It\u2019s just the way that \u2013 our invoicing from our contract manufacturers, in particular, worked out. It resulted in a little more cash went out the door than expense. I expect that to kind of recover in the future quarter \u2013 in this quarter in Q3.","Rod Hall","Is that affected by the tariffs at all, Ken, or is it just kind of a random event that\u2026","Ken Miller","No.","Rod Hall","\u2026doesn\u2019t relate to anything that we would see happening out there?","Ken Miller","Yes.","Rod Hall","Okay.","Ken Miller","I really would \u2013 I really call it a random, but then it has no impact from the tariffs.","Rod Hall","Okay, great. I appreciate that.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Fawcett, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Meta Marshall","This is Meta Marshall from \u2013 for James. Quick question. Just stepping back on tariffs, you noted the changes that you had made to kind of largely mitigate the impact, but that there would be kind of an ongoing impact in the second-half. And so can you just walk through whether production is being moved or whether there would be kind of a remaining ongoing impact that we should model unless the trade agreement is reached? And then, maybe just following-up on that. Is \u2013 what is kind of the ability to pass on a price change? And what have you found as an ability to do so? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yes. From a tariff, the primary mitigation efforts have revolved around really changing where our manufacturing is being completed as an interest into the U.S. So we have a global footprint. As you know, we manufacture within China. We manufacture in other parts of Asia, which are non-tariff and we also manufacture in parts of North America, Mexico and U.S.","So we have opportunity to move most of the production to other locations that was primarily done in China previously. And that\u2019s really resulted us mitigating the vast majority. That said, we\u2019re not able \u2013 we are not \u2013 we\u2019ve chosen not to move all production out of China, so there are still some products that we still manufacturer only in China. And as always going to the U.S., we are seeing a tariff. It\u2019s, again, it\u2019s the minority of our total tariff exposure, if you were to go back, say, a year ago before tariffs, because we\u2019ve been able to offset most of it.","That 30 to 50 basis point impact that I\u2019m talking about is really a difference between a 10% and a 25% tariff. So there is \u2013 we still expect to be a tariff in the second-half. In addition to the actual cost of tariff, we know some of the mitigation efforts by moving manufacturing from location to different locations has resulted in overall slight uptick in our cost of goods sold really as part of the mitigation. So there is some costs associated with that as well.","We are passing along some of that tariff increase to our customers. We\u2019ve been fairly successful of doing that. But there have been some situations where we haven\u2019t been able to pass all the cost through, which is why we are seeing some impact to our gross margin.","Meta Marshall","Got it. And so would you kind of \u2013 if there were a trade agreement reach tomorrow, would that go away, because you would move that production back, or like how should we just consider the timing of how long the 30 to 50 basis point impact would kind of impact margins?","Rami Rahim","Yes, I think we would get a benefit of hover an agreement tomorrow to eliminate the tariff. I don\u2019t think we would get back to our previous cost of goods sold, because I do not believe we would move manufacturing back into China. We would likely keep it where it currently is, which is \u2013 has a slight impact, but much less than the actual cost of the tariff. So we would see a benefit if the tariff would be eliminated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off with a question on the Wi-Fi upgrades, the cycle that you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times in the prepared remarks. As you\u2019re talking to customers about the Wi-Fi 6, upcoming cycle around Wi-Fi 6, I know we have kind of earlier to that cycle. But are you getting a sense that customers are willing to upgrade to the Wi-Fi 6 product? And as you\u2019re looking at kind of campus switching and Wi-Fi 6 together, should we think about it as a kind of a combined product cycle, or are customers thinking about it independently in terms of an upgrade?","Rami Rahim","Yes, thanks for the question, Samik. So I do think it\u2019s still early days, but Wi-Fi 6 is going to be a pretty significant growth driver for us in the campus and branch segment. The first Mist Systems Wi-Fi 6 products are actually now shipping, and we even have a few early deployments with some of our high-end enterprise customers that are starting to leverage that technology.","To your question around whether is standalone or more combined, it\u2019s all of the above. There are customers that have decoupled buying cycles between wireless LAN and wired technology. And in those customers, we\u2019ll certainly \u2013 we\u2019ll sell them the technology that they want.","But with every customer that buys wireless LAN from us, there is an opportunity to either attach immediately, or at some point in the future through the fact that we\u2019ve now created a channel into that customer and built the relationships with the IT team to sell them additional technology, whether it be wired or security, or SD-WAN, as an example.","So that synergy based on the early days of the integration with Mist is becoming more and more of a reality for us and we\u2019re proving out the thesis that we had. I just also just want to point out, in order to realize the full potential of the AX standard, which typically add some level of complexity to a network, you really need to have the kind of cloud managed AI engine that Mist Systems brings to the table that I\u2019m now seeing firsthand how valuable it is for our customers.","It simplifies not only the deployment, but it also simplifies the ongoing operations of a wired wireless LAN network and many of our customers are absolutely loving it. And I think that can be extended \u2013 that experience can be extended to other parts of our portfolio as well.","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. If I could clarify on the cloud revenue that you had, you had a strong sequential growth this quarter. But you\u2019re kind of guiding to a sequential decline next quarter that does suggest that they might have been some exceptional pull forward of revenues this quarter. So just want to clarify if revenues from the cloud side did come in better because of some pull forward from 3Q that\u2019s what you saw?","Rami Rahim","No, I don\u2019t believe this because of a pull forward. I think if you take a look at our cloud business over the last couple of years, we\u2019re sort of seeing a bit of a cyclicality that\u2019s happening throughout the year, where Q2 tends to be a little quite strong just based on the timing of deployments and seeing a bit of moderation on a sequential basis is not anything that I\u2019m really concerned about.","We\u2019re going to see some ebbs and flows in this business based on timing of deployments. But the Meta points for cloud is that the really hard transition is now behind us. We\u2019re now at a point in a very unique position in terms of the footprint that we enjoy in the cloud routing space.","We will see a recovery in that business, a continued recovery based on the continued investments that our big cloud customers are making in the routing segment. And, of course, then that focus that we have on net new segments, especially in our net new technology areas and footprint, especially in switching.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Notter, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","George Notter","Hey, thanks a lot, guys. Ken, maybe first one for you on the tax rate. 19.5%, I think is a certainly a bump up from the kinds of tax rates, I think, we talked about in the past. I guess, I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s really changing there?","And then for Rami, I guess, I\u2019m inferring from the conversation here that the service provider routing business really took a big step down in Q2. Your cloud business overall was flat year-on-year. We know that business is really heavily centered on routing, and yet the routing business was down 15% year-on-year. So I guess, again, I\u2019m inferring that the difference there is service provider routing. Is that a hold up from customers waiting for the MX 5G line cards, or is there something else going on in service provider routing? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yes. Let me start and then, Ken, why don\u2019t you jump in on the question around with a tax rate. In the service provider space, which is largely determined by our routing technology, it really is just much of the business model challenges and the macro challenges, the challenges around service providers, as well as their focus on areas of investments that are outside of routing.","Beyond that, I do think that, we\u2019re in a mode right now where our traditional customers in the service provider space, especially Tier 1 customers in North America, are in and of themselves, not going to be enough for us to achieve growth in this vertical. So there is a very concerted effort within the company right now to build net new footprint, especially in International Service Provider account.","So that\u2019s going to take a number of quarters to build out. But that\u2019s the thing that we need to do internally in order to sort of recover this \u2013 that routing and in particular routing in the SP space. That\u2019s kind of the bulk of what\u2019s happening in routing for us.","Ken Miller","On tax rate front, there\u2019s really a couple of things if you really want to kind of reconcile to, say, last year\u2019s rate, one would be the discrete items. Last year, we had some kind of discrete items that positively impacted our tax rate, which is why it was lower last year. This year, those discrete items are actually going the other direction slightly. And also really, it\u2019s the international mix of earnings is a big factor on attach rate as well.","So that also resulted in the rate being 19.5% for Q2. Now I\u2019m trying to take some of that volatility out going forward by fixing the rate for the rest of the year on a non-GAAP basis at 19.5%. And the plan would be to, as we enter into next year, we\u2019ll have a fixed rate for the full-year next year as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Sami Badri","Sure. Thank you. Regarding the software percentage of total revenue, the 10%, was the fair majority of that security revenues? Because there was a bit of an uptick in security and maybe you could just give me more color on that side?","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks for the question, Sami. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just security, but certainly there is an element of it that\u2019s tied to security because out of all of our technology areas, the software attach rate for security has traditionally been the strongest. The momentum we\u2019re seeing in software is the combination of on-box software.","So software that\u2019s attached to systems, security, switching and routing that\u2019s either way into our customers networks, and also the off-box software with things like the cloud management and AI solution for Mist or Contrail Enterprise Multi-cloud solution for the data center or for telco cloud. It\u2019s that combination.","There is a real strategy that we\u2019re executing internally to increase software, the percentage of revenue. We\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made. I think we are on track to achieve the objective of 16% software as a component of total revenue in the 2021 timeframe. And I think that the roadmap and the business models around those roadmaps that we have, we are introducing it to the market allow us to continue to see this momentum.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you. And then the \u2013 my next question has to do with the major customer that you called out approximately 10% or more of total revenues and I\u2019m sure if you said more approximately. But did this customer spend or consume products across multiple segments, or was it predominantly just routing or switch, or switching? Maybe just give me an idea on what exactly the buying patterns are when these big customers come to you?","Rami Rahim","Yes. So we mentioned this is a customer that is in our cloud vertical and the technology areas are routing and switching, mostly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva, Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. Rami, you spoke quite positively about enterprise for the September or Q3 quarter. Looking at the results for this quarter, it looks like it was down year-over-year, I think it was about 6% or so you said or mentioned. Was there some delays or push outs to Q3? Or can you help us understand your confidence or why a challenge June quarter and then a quite positive outlook for the September quarter for the Enterprise segment? Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Yes. Thanks for the question, Jim. So we saw double-digit, in fact, 12% year-over-year growth in bookings in the enterprise vertical and even stronger sequential growth in bookings for the Q2 period in the enterprise space. That was fueled by a number of different factors. We had strength in the U.S. government, and I believe that is going to be a good vertical for us going forward. But we also have real strength in the technologies that we\u2019re now introducing to the market that are giving us some real differentiation.","I mentioned the campus and branch. SD-WAN is an area where we have been investing in and putting focus in over the last couple of years, that now is starting to become a contributor to our performance, where we\u2019re seeing a very healthy pipeline.","We\u2019re seeing both accounts that we\u2019re winning with a direct enterprise model, as well as leveraging our service providers as a channel into net new enterprise footprints. All of this is leading to the confidence that we have in the second-half of the year.","Ken, you might want to talk a little bit about the difference between the revenue performance and bookings performance for the quarter?","Ken Miller","Sure. So as Rami mentioned, bookings were up double digits. Revenue, as you mentioned, Jim, was down 6%. That\u2019s really a result of this \u2013 the deployments that our customers wanted there for our shipments into those orders. Linearity on the bookings perspective was actually quite normal. So we didn\u2019t have a back-end in quarter or anything like that from bookings perspective.","However, the way the shipments laid out, it resulted in the results that we have, and therefore, backlog went up in Q2. Our enterprise focus backlog went up, which gives us more confidence about Q3.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for the details. That\u2019s greatly appreciates.","Rami Rahim","Sure. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Genovese, MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Genovese","Great. Thanks very much. Hey, Rami, I\u2019m thinking about the verticals that Juniper competes in and they go through them in service provider. I see a company that reported this morning, just released a new product and had pretty strong results in that segment. I\u2019m claiming to take a lot of share.","In the cloud vertical, there\u2019s a competitor reporting next week who has consistently outperformed for years here versus [indiscernible]. And then in enterprise, you\u2019re kind of a point solution versus a much broader vendor. So I\u2019m just sort of struggling, I\u2019m sorry to put it this way. But I\u2019m struggling to sort of think where is Juniper the best at. Like what technology, what market, what vertical are you bringing a unique \u2013 I mean, I know you bring differentiation? But where is it really taking hold? And where should I look for Juniper to really show some leadership in the market and gain some share over the next year?","Rami Rahim","Okay. Thanks for the question. There\u2019s a lot to unpack there, but let me try. In the cloud space, we have a very unique position in cloud routing, a position that we have built over a number of years, where that strength in terms of the footprint that we hold has remained as a result of a very deliberate strategy to ensure that our customers have the very best technology in order to build out what is networks that carry a huge amount of traffic. That strength is really unique to Juniper.","We have substantial market share. And the path forward is one, where we leverage that footprint to continue to grow in that vertical based on timing of deployment, but also the ability to grow into net new footprint, which we have a real opportunity to do so, especially with the 400-gig cycle that\u2019s coming.","In the enterprise. I would respectfully disagree with the notion that Juniper is a point player. In fact, we\u2019re one of only two vendors in the market that has a full portfolio in the campus and branch that extends wired and wireless, as well as SD-WAN to provide our customers with an end-to-end solution that\u2019s, in fact, embedded in security that is actually working in the markets.","The momentum that we\u2019re seeing in the market is not by accident, it\u2019s very much a function of the fact that this is an area we focused in from a technology standpoint and from a sales standpoint. And then there\u2019s the data center side, where we have some unique differentiation there as well, in terms of the software and the hardware capabilities.","In the SP space, I think there is a market dynamic that people need to understand. If you\u2019re going to compare us to others in the industry, you really have to look at this across a number of different areas. First, our strength has traditionally been more in North America.","And as I mentioned earlier, I believe some of the bigger build-outs now are happening more internationally and we need to tap into that. And we do that through great partnerships, but also by betting on go-to-market for net new footprint, which is in the process of happening right now.","Secondarily, it\u2019s around sort of where are our technology strength lies. Today, it\u2019s mostly in the core, in the edge and the metro. I believe that there are build-outs happening internationally that are more in the access mobile backhaul space, where our portfolio is still now sort of coming together.","So as that comes together, we\u2019ll be able to leverage the strength and the relationships we have with a number of customers to see a rebuilding of momentum in the SP space. That\u2019s how I would characterize the strength we have, but as well as the opportunity that we have across the different verticals.","Michael Genovese","Well, that\u2019s a very good answer to a tough question. Thank you.","Rami Rahim","You bet. My pleasure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tejas Venkatesh, UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you. I was hoping you could parse your switching performance between data center and campus in 2Q and what you see from an orders perspective, looking forward?","Rami Rahim","Yes, certainly. So, in the switching space, I saw, I think, we saw a meaningful sequential recovery off of a tough Q1. We still have ways to go and a lot of opportunity ahead of us in the switching space. I\u2019d say that it\u2019s sort of equally split roughly more or less between the campus and the data center environment. We\u2019re certainly seeing some momentum in the campus space because of the fact that we\u2019ve now plugged what was a gap in our portfolio and wireless LAN.","In the data center, I think that our differentiation and our ability to penetrate net new footprints and to reaccelerate that portion of our business comes down to a couple of different things. There\u2019s the hyperscalar opportunity with 400-gig, which is obviously very important in a key area focus. But then in the enterprise, it\u2019s \u2013 getting the enterprise multi-cloud software solution that simplifies the deployments and the ongoing operations of data center build-outs in the enterprise that I think is going to help.","Now we\u2019ve introduced the first version of that solution, that software solution just recently. We\u2019re in the mode of making sort of a very rapid enhancements that are based on specific customer feedback that we are getting. And I think as we get into the back-half of the year, it\u2019s going to contribute and going to help us in the data center portion of our switching business.","Ken Miller","The only thing I would add to that is both our QFX product line, which is predominantly focused on data center and our EX, which is focused on the campus and branch, both grew sequentially. So we are seeing momentum across both sets of really switching platforms.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you. And as a follow-up, you mentioned, Rami, earlier that some of the bigger service provider deployments are happening internationally and that\u2019s not traditionally where your strength has been. I wonder if you could speak specifically about the EMEA region, other routing companies appear to have outperformed Juniper in EMEA over the last few quarters. And now you\u2019ve made leadership changes and so forth. We also have the Huawei dynamic. So talk to us a little bit about the EMEA region and your efforts there?","Rami Rahim","Yes. The EMEA region, of course, is a huge region that includes Western Europe, where we have a real strength in a number of specific accounts, Tier 1 operators, in particular. It also includes a number of emerging markets, Middle East and Africa, et cetera, where we\u2019re still relatively a small player, but where we do see some real opportunity to grow the business. In fact, that is a big area of focus in net new accounts where we traditionally have not had a lot of presence and strength.","So that is definitely a big part of the focus I just mentioned to expand into net new opportunities. Yes, outside of the U.S. where we have traditionally been strong, also outside of just Western Europe, which has been a driver of our EMEA performance historically, I think, we can sort of add fuel to that with more of the emerging market opportunities that I believe exist ahead of us.","Operator","We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Jess Lubert for closing remarks.","Jess Lubert","Thank you, operator. Before we conclude the call, we would like to make everyone aware that we will be hosting an AI for Enterprise TED Talk on August 14. We will also be participating in sell-side conferences hosted by Oppenheimer, Jefferies, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank this quarter. Additional details regarding our participation in these events will be available on our IR website. We look forward to meeting and speaking with many of you during the quarter. That concludes today\u2019s call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin R. Johnson","Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome to all of you joining us on today's conference call. I'm pleased with our results this quarter as we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, reflecting good execution against our strategy. Overall, our results were in line with the expectations we set in the second quarter. We continue to see strength in the service provider market, the enterprise tracked largely as we expected, and security continued its trend towards stabilization, with sequential growth in the third quarter. In each of these areas, we continue to exhibit the strength and innovation of our product portfolio.","Overall, the macro environment remains dynamic. While we are encouraged to see the U.S. government reopen, we are mindful of potential volatility in the Federal sector.","There are a few things I'd like to highlight for the third quarter before I turn the call over to Rami for an update on our Platform Systems division. First, the response we're getting from customers indicates our SDN and network function virtualization strategy continues to resonate with them. SDN is a growth opportunity for us in both networking systems and software. Our vision is to unleash innovation and agility in customer IT investments by unblocking the impediment of the static network to their cloud strategies. We're doing this in 3 ways. First, we offer a unique advantage through our deep knowledge and proven track record of innovation in high-performance networking, with a focus on systems and software. Second, we provide clarity of choice with software and programmable systems that are based on industry standards and open source models with Open Contrail. Customers can buy our products and solutions today. And finally, we have outlined a clear 4-step implementation strategy for customers that includes a flexible, cloud-oriented software licensing model, the Juniper Software Advantage.","As we mentioned last quarter, following highly successful beta trials, we launched our Contrail SDN Controller earlier than our original 2014 ship date. Contrail works in private and public cloud environments to virtualize the company's data center network and enable service providers to build new Edge networks that significantly reduce the time required to deploy future services. We have both a commercial and an open license model for Contrail. Open Contrail, our open source license version, provides access to all aspects of the Contrail source code, offering easy integration, a stable platform, a production-ready code base and compatibility with both CloudStack and OpenStack. It is our view that the open-source business model of Open Contrail will enable maximum reach, while the commercial Contrail business model allows us to monetize Contrail for those customers who look to Juniper for a supported version of the product. In addition to providing world-class end-to-end solutions across Juniper's routing, switching and security systems, we have also enabled Contrail to work with competitors' network hardware and software products. This will reduce both the time and risk associated with deploying network virtualization technologies by customers, accelerating the benefits of SDN and network function virtualization.","In other product highlights, we had a strong quarter in routing, which Rami will discuss in more detail. We also saw good growth in our switching bookings that reflect good traction in the data center. You can expect some additional data center announcements later this month.","Looking at our overall markets, we continue to drive innovation in service provider, where we're focused on carrier, including wireless and wireline, along with cable and web 2.0 companies. As I mentioned, we're executing as we said we would in SDN and network function virtualization with Contrail, and we're continuing our progress in systems and software and data centers and service provider networks. In addition, we're continuing to focus on advancing the integration of optical and routing. We are well-positioned to take advantage of the continued growth we're seeing in the Edge and the expected growth we've been talking about in the core, with good momentum across our broad product portfolio. Globally, we're seeing strength in service provider across all 3 geographies, the Americas, EMEA and APAC.","In the enterprise, we continue you to focus on high-performance networking to help transform the SDN-enabled virtualized data center. Within the data center, we help customers virtualize their network and connect their private clouds to commercially provided public clouds. This is also enabled by our Contrail Controller. In security, as we have said consistently in recent quarters, we continue to see signs of stabilization in the product portfolio. For data centers, we are driving the industry agenda on security, and today, we have the most advanced solution to protect data centers from attack. Our campus and branch installed base is significant, and we're evolving that technology to meet the emerging needs of our customers. And we continue to introduce new features and improve manageability of our security solutions. Although we haven't yet returned to year-over-year growth in this business, the sequential growth we saw in the third quarter is encouraging, and we believe our security business is well-positioned for a return to growth in 2014.","Wrapping up, we continue to drive our innovation agenda, offering unique solutions for our customers in each of our markets. While the macroeconomic environment continues to be dynamic, we believe the business is healthy and momentum is building. We are focused on executing with agility and delivering long-term growth to our stakeholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rami.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Kevin. It's great to be here today to discuss the third quarter results for the Platform Systems Division. Overall, I'm pleased with this past quarter. Kevin covered the results at a high level, so what I'll do is walk through some of the drivers behind this quarter's results for PSD and provide some additional context.","There are 2 key businesses within PSD, Routing and Switching, and the customers we serve span both service provider and enterprise. I'm pleased to report that PSD's revenue came in at $939 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 13% year-over-year. Our PSD product revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% year-over-year. For Q3, PSD product revenue was at $742 million, our highest product revenue on record, demonstrating solid performance and continued growth in this business.","The sequential increase in PSD revenues overall was driven primarily by growth in routing and strength in service providers globally. This quarter's switching results were mixed, up slightly year-over-year, but down sequentially due to lumpiness in service provider demand for data center solutions. While switching revenue declined sequentially, our switching bookings were healthy. In routing, we saw strong spending among our Tier 1 service providers, as well as strength among our cable and Web 2.0 customers. In the enterprise, demand is being created by data center consolidation, data center modernization and the continued adoption of fabric-based architectures.","Let's go a bit deeper on our results. First, Routing, the PSD Routing business was up 7% quarter-over-quarter and up 22% year-over-year. Quarterly growth was driven by both core and edge routing, and the year-over-year growth in routing was driven primarily by edge routing. We continue to have a diverse customer base and a robust product mix. We simplified our product portfolio and delivered innovative products and technologies, including new variants of the MX2020 and the MX2010 and a new multiservice line card that delivers high-performance services to the MX.","The Junos 13.2 release also came out in Q3, and it was packed with compelling customer features.","We had some great routing wins this quarter, one at a leading Australian provider of home and mobile communications and broadband, and another at a leading Canadian provider of cable and Internet.","The PSD Switching business was down 8% quarter-over-quarter and up 1% year-over-year. The quarterly decline was partly due to coming off a strong quarter in Q2 and partly due to the variability in service provider demand for data center solutions. On the other hand, we did see good bookings growth year-over-year and have a strong backlog going into the next quarter. We continue to see growth in both data center and combined campus and data center deployment. We saw strength in top-of-rack and 10-gig overall, both sequentially and year-over-year. We also saw good repeat and new business in both Service Provider and Enterprise accounts for switching.","Our innovation pipeline was rich in the third quarter as we shipped several new variants of our EX family of fixed switches, as well as new 100-gig line cards for the EX9200. On the SDN front, Juniper also announced the general availability of our Contrail Controller that enables seamless integration between physical and virtual networks for both service providers and enterprises. It had been in trials with roughly 40 customers across the world. We are very pleased that we were able to pull in the dates of this release and ship a product that supports industry-standard protocols. All credit goes to our hard-working and innovative engineers.","We also joined with VMware at VMworld in August to announce a hardware accelerated physical to virtual gateway solution using Juniper's high-performance networking infrastructure and VMware's NSX. The data center is an important focus area for us, and you'll continue to hear about our innovations in the domain, as Kevin mentioned earlier.","We had some great wins in switching and wireless as well, one with a multinational industry leader in oil and gas exploration and refining, and the other at a global financial services firm.","So with all that said, I summarize as follows: we are well positioned in the edge, core and virtualized data center with our portfolios today and innovations in the pipeline. Customer feedback around our solutions and recently launched innovations have been very positive. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing, and I'm satisfied with how we are delivering against our innovation agenda.","At this point, I'm going to turn it over to Robyn. Thank you.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our third quarter results reflect continued momentum in revenue and earnings growth. Revenue came in slightly higher than our expectations, driven by continued strength in Service Provider Routing. Non-GAAP earnings increased sequentially due to healthy growth margins, partially offset by operating expenses that were at the upper end of our guidance. Our focus on driving top line growth and operational excellence is unchanged. With that goal in mind, we continue to work to improve our cost structure.","In the third quarter, we took additional steps to rationalize our product portfolios and rebalanced our investments. I will talk more about this and associated restructuring charges later in my prepared remarks.","Looking at our demand metrics, we continue to see signs of strength in the service provider market and, for the first time in several quarters, saw this in all 3 geographies. We had a good bookings quarter, with book-to-bill greater than 1. Product deferred revenue was up slightly quarter-over-quarter, and backlog remained at healthy levels. Total revenue was $1,186,000,000, up 3% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Product revenue was up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 7% from a year ago. Services revenue was down slightly versus the prior quarter, primarily due to the timing of certain renewals. Although we had no 10% customers this quarter, we saw strong revenues from our top-tier carrier customers.","For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19, including a $0.02 impact from restructuring charges. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.33, up $0.04 sequentially and increased significantly by $0.11 year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven primarily by higher revenue and gross margins, but also included a $0.01 benefit from the lower tax rate.","Now let me provide color on revenue by region, market and business segment. Americas revenue was down 2% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to Enterprise. As a reminder, Q2's Enterprise results included the recognition of $34 million of government revenue that is previously being deferred. Excluding this, Q3 Enterprise revenue in the Americas would have increased by 1% sequentially. Also, Enterprise was up 6% year-over-year, reflecting broad-based strength, partially offset by some softness in the financial services and Federal markets. Americas Service Provider increased sequentially by 4% and had its third quarter in a row of double digit year-over-year growth, reflecting wins across content, carriers and cable service provider verticals.","EMEA revenue was up 2% sequentially, but down 5% year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven by strong Service Provider performance as design wins in the U.K. and Middle East began converting to revenue shipments. Enterprise demand was weak in the quarter relative to a strong performance in Q2 due to some business taking longer than we expected to close.","APAC router rebounded sharply from a weak Q2, growing 25% quarter-over-quarter with double digit increases in both Service Provider and Enterprise. This strong performance was driven by good growth in China, Australia and South Korea. Service Provider revenue was $788 million, up 9% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, with broad based strength across all 3 geographies. Enterprise revenue was $397 million, down 6% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Excluding the government deferred revenue recognition in Q2, Enterprise would have been up slightly quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year decline was due to weaker financial services and government business globally, and the timing of some large switching builds in APAC and EMEA.","Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems division revenue was $939 million, up 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Total router product revenue of $609 million was up 5% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The MX product line had its second successive revenue record quarter, growing 15% sequentially. The recently released MX2020 and MX2010 product continued to gain traction with customers. Core routing had a good quarter, growing 11% sequentially, with the T Series product line having its best quarter in the last 4 quarters.","Total switching product revenue of $148 million was down 8% sequentially from a record Q2 and up 1% year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily due to the timing in certain Service Provider data center deployment and the migration to the new EX9200 switching platform. We did see strong bookings in the quarter and expect switching to regain its momentum.","SSD revenue was $246 million, up 5% sequentially, but down 15% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $144 million, increasing nicely at 14% sequentially. As I mentioned last quarter, we were seeing early signs of the business turning around, and this quarter's results are a positive sign. Service Provider security revenue was strong in the quarter, with high-end SRX growing double digits sequentially. Enterprise security continued to stabilize with a record quarter for branch SRX and good sequential growth for high-end SRX in the data center. This is still the early stage of our security business recovery, and we continue to focus on growing revenue. Our new products continue to secure design wins with revenues greater than $110 million for the quarter.","Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 64.4% compared to 63.7% last quarter and 65.6% a year ago. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 65.4%, an increase of 1.6% over last quarter and a decrease of 1.4% from last year. As expected, the sequential improvement was largely the result of the non-recurrence of last quarter's Federal revenue recognition. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 61.3%, a decrease of 2% from last quarter and a 0.9% from last year. The sequential decline was a result of lower revenue and higher support-related costs.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $530 million, an increase of $14 million sequentially and a decrease of $15 million year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to higher legal expenses. We continue to focus on operational excellence and driving efficiency in our investments. With that goal in mind, we have taken some restructuring and rebalancing actions in October that will result in the elimination of approximately 280 positions in the fourth quarter. We have also continued our real estate consolidation.","Looking at headcount, we ended Q3 with 9,714 employees, a sequential increase of 201, primarily in lower cost regions.","Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter expanded to 19.8% compared to 18.9% last quarter and a significant improvement over the 16.9% last year. The sequential increase was driven by higher revenue and gross margins, and an improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.5% compared to 27.4% last quarter. This improvement is due to the geographic mix of income and some onetime items.","Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3 billion of net cash and investments. We generated strong operating cash flows of $176 million, in line with our historical patents. Q3 DSO was 42 days, up from 40 days last quarter. Capital expenditures were $41 million, down 43% sequentially as a result of the completion of the first phase of our Sunnyvale campus, while depreciation and amortization expense was $41 million.","We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $93 million at an average price of $20.92. And we have $1.2 billion remaining on our current authorization.","Now I will review our outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We expect the December quarter to reflect continued strong Service Provider demand, with some improvement in Enterprise. However, we are carefully monitoring any impacts in Federal spending from the recent U.S. government shutdown.","For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,200,000,000 to $1,230,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 64.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to range from $510 million to $525 million. At the midpoint of guidance, operating margins are expected to be approximately 22%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.35 and $0.37 per share, assuming a flat share count and a tax rate of approximately 27.5%. On a GAAP basis, we also expect an additional restructuring charge of approximately $10 million related to the fourth quarter headcount actions.","To summarize, we anticipate the overall demand to be healthy, with some potential challenges in Federal. As we drive to close out the year, our product portfolio and focus on execution are very strong. I would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.","And now, with that, let me turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had a couple. I wanted to go back to security, because I thought that was a pretty positive number and just see if you could elaborate a little bit on what's going on there? What should we be thinking about trajectory, et cetera? And where are those revenues coming from customer-wise, if you can give us any more color on that? And then just on the guidance, which is below what we were expecting -- I mean, it feels like it's probably related to Federal\/Enterprise, but can you just clarify what the driver for this slightly weaker revenue expectation is for Q4?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, thanks for your questions, Rod. I'll take the first one, and then I'll hand off to Robyn to take the second question on the guide. Yes, on security, we had a good sequential uptick on revenue in our security business. And I think it's a reflection of the continued progress we're making. As I mentioned before on these calls, there's kind of 3 categories of scenarios that we're focused on in security. One of them is securing Service Provider LTE networks and the mobile Internet. The second is data centers, both service provider and enterprise data centers, and the third is campus and branch. In the area of service providers and securing the LTE networks, we did see some good momentum again on the service -- or this quarter on the service provider said, which is one of the contributors on that uptick, but we also saw very good growth sequentially on our high-end SRX, which is used both for those service providers and the data centers. So I think that the data center solution that we have, that provides Web AppSecure, Spotlight, as well as that high-end SRX, we believe, is an industry-leading solution, and we're seeing some continued progress, especially with the high-end SRX. And then for campus and branch, we also saw good sequential growth in our branch SRX, and that is also an area that we are doing some additional work for some new capabilities that we'll hear more about in the future. But I think overall, the SRX business did well. The ScreenOS revenue as a percentage of the total is a lower percentage of the total than it was in the prior quarter, which is a reflection of us continuing to make progress on moving that installed base and migrating from the ScreenOS revenue streams to the SRX and the rest of the security products. So overall, I think it's a good data point that gives us confidence we're executing against the right things. But that said, we know we still have a lot of work to do. We're very clear about that. We're very focused on that. We have the resources applied to that, and we believe we're well positioned for growth on our security business in 2014. Robyn, I'll let you take the question on guidance.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. So, Rod, on the guidance question, in terms of the Service Provider momentum that we've been seeing and we saw in the third quarter, we expect that to continue. We're seeing good design wins in all 3 theaters, and we continue to execute really well. The guidance is tempered by our expectation of Federal being weak in the fourth quarter. We did see some signs of that in the third quarter, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, and we do expect that in the fourth quarter. And so absent that, even through Enterprise, we're expecting to continue on a good path. But the Federal weakness, we're expecting in the fourth quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the core side, I have 2 questions. On the core side, can you discuss where the strength is coming from PTX versus the T Series, the new T Series? That's one question, and if you can elaborate actually on PTX, given that it's a architectural change. And then this one is a broader question. If I look at your chart, Chart #9, basically, the growth is coming from service providers in North America, if I combine 2 pieces. Is this a tied -- spending tied, and that's what lifts up revenues? Or is this more company-related? That means, if we have some slower growth of spending next year in certain projects, are -- is there going to be a reversal of these positive trends? Or do you have enough product cycles that can lift you up even in a more challenging environment?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes. Thanks for your questions, Tal. Why don't I take your second question first, and then I'm going to hand over to Rami to talk a little bit more about core and the trends that we see there. Your second question had to do -- or sort of around broad growth in the service provider sector. And I think what we see unfolding is very consistent with what we outlined in the last earnings call at the end of Q2, which is we continue to see service providers turn their attention and their CapEx investments to their IT networks. And we saw a lot of strength in edge. But this was a quarter where we also saw good sequential uptick in core. We believe that is going to continue. We believe -- if we look at the projects that we have, there are a pipeline of projects that we're working on that will begin deployment in next year. And so I think that we anticipate continued momentum going forward. In -- specifically in our America Service Provider business, not only did we see strength with our Tier 1 service providers, but we also saw it in cable and the Web 2.0 content providers. And so -- as well as the Tier 2 and Tier 3 carriers as well. So it's a broad trend that we believe will continue. In Europe, I think, with the service provider landscape in Europe, I guess, the way I would characterize it is that the large carriers were mixed but stable. There were some that had projects that ended, others that had projects that kicked off. Some of those service providers projects that ended, we have visibility to the next wave of projects. So I think Europe service provider has stabilized, and I think it's at the point they too need to invest CapEx in their IP infrastructure. And there's been some wins that Rami mentioned that we had there. And in Asia, we also saw good sequential uptick in service providers, primarily in countries such as Korea, Australia, China. I think other countries were not quite as strong. I think Japan was also a good performer. So the net is, I think, on a global basis, this trend that we see of service provider CapEx on the routing infrastructure was evident in the fact that all 3 theaters showed good sequential growth. And we think that, that's going to continue into 2014. With that, let me hand over to Rami. And perhaps, Rami, you can take Tal's first question on core and what we're seeing there related to PTX, T and some trends in core. Rami?","Rami Rahim","Yes, I'd be happy to, Kevin. First, I'll say that the main drivers that are sort of affecting our year-over-year performance in routing are still in the Edge. And I think that the demand factors there are very strong, whether it be capacity or service delivery or connectivity. But that said, we are pleased with what we've seen from a sequential standpoint in the core. We've been saying now for a couple of quarters that the core networks are running hotter, and therefore, there is going to need to be an upgrade cycle. And the fact that we're now seeing some sequential performance gives us conviction in that belief. As far as the question around T versus PTX, certainly, both are performing quite well. PTX year-over-year performance is very healthy. T Series in fact, I will say, is driving a lot of the sequential performance. You're actually right in that PTX is a bit of an architectural transition, which is why we have the T and the MX as other options for our customers to round out our portfolio and make sure we're well equipped to address any sort of core build out. The T Series remains the best investment story, investment protection story in the industry. And the PTX, especially now, is we introduced before the end of this year, we've announced this already, our 100-gig DWDM interfaces is really going to make it a very compelling packet optical solution for operators that are looking to consolidate layers in their network and simplify their network.","Operator","The next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe first for Kevin, just in terms of going back to the previous comment you made, it just feels like many of the service providers, I'm thinking the telco service providers, are indicating slowly -- it seems that they need to invest not only in the U.S. but Europe is recovering. There is signs of life, continued signs of life in Asia. I'm just wondering, how has your visibility changed over the last 3 or 6 months in your conversation? And color you could give around that would be helpful. And my second question is on the SDN side, I know it's very early days, if you were to guess today in terms of these customers going from the 40 or so trials to an actual stage of relatively meaningful deployment, whatever -- however you want to describe that, how long is that away? Is that 2 to 5 years, 12 months? Just the discussions you're having with the products you've launched. How do you see the whole shape of that evolving?","Kevin R. Johnson","Thank you for your questions. I'll take the first question, and then perhaps I'll hand off to Rami to talk a little bit about SDN and how he sees that unfolding in the marketplace. In terms of looking at what we see as a continued building strength of the service provider industry and marketplace, your question specifically was how we've seen visibility change in the last 3 to 6 months. And I would say that the trends that we identified, I would say in Q3 of the year ago, so about 12 months ago, are consistent. Yet I would say our visibility to the specific projects has -- continues to improve and continues to strengthen. And that's a function of bids that customers had that they were in the process of working that we have been awarded, and the teams are now engaged working on those projects. And in some cases, it includes new features, new software. I think the fact that our backlog is up, our deferred revenue is up, the pipeline is strong, all of those, are data points that are indicators that the visibility to that service provider spending cycle has improved over the last 1 to 2 quarters. Let me hand off to Rami to share our perspective then on SDN and how quickly, Rami, you see deployments unfolding.","Rami Rahim","Certainly. So I look at a number of different layers. With respect to SDN, it is certainly still in the early stages, and there are a lot of customers that we're having discussions with around the journey that they will undertake in order to deploy SDN in their network. Today, what we're doing in fact is we're implementing the hook into our systems, into our platforms and the programmability into our platform that gives customers the peace of mind that they are investing in switching, routing, security that will evolve through this SDN journey without having to do a wholesale of network upgrades. That is very much resonating with our customers and we're seeing momentum in the market as a result of that message alone. Now we're also of course developing really industry-leading software, like our Contrail Controller, that provides unprecedented scales, that provides things like resiliency and peering between controllers and so forth that our customers are starting to really think about how they're going to deploy in order to solve a number of challenges in their network. I think that this is going to play out over multiple quarters. I think that one of the most prominent applications for it will be in the data center, to build out overlay networks for the purpose of virtualizing networks in the data center. We want to do this both with our own systems and our own controller, as well as with our own systems and partners like VMware. As I said, it's going to take a few quarters for this to pan out, but we're very confident in the solutions that we're developing to address these applications that I mentioned.","Operator","The next question comes from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 questions. The first one was I think you commented that China bounced back in the quarter. If you can just dig into that a little bit since some others have commented on weakness there. And then the second one, kind of back to the core routing dynamics, and perhaps this one's for Rami, are you seeing any impact at all from the new product introductions in the market from Alcatel, as well as Cisco's CRS-X, and the NCS, whether in terms of market share or pricing or just any other implications?","Kevin R. Johnson","Thanks for your questions, Simona. I'll take your first question, and then I'll hand off to Rami for the second question. Just to clarify, I think in the comments, what we saw was we saw good sequential growth in APAC, of which China was one of the contributors. And I think my comments on China, specifically on the service provider side, is that our strategy has always been one that we've been very targeted or very surgical on the opportunities or the areas that we focus on in China, specifically those opportunities that play to our strengths, of having a differentiated product set in the areas of scale and performance for very -- obviously very high volumes of traffic in China. And I think there were some opportunities in the quarter that unfolded, that generated some revenue for us in China, specifically in the service provider routing side of the market that contributed to the overall APAC results. I think China -- we work closely with our partner, Ericsson in many of the service provider instances. And so Ericsson continues to be a very good partner for us in certain geographies. And certainly, China is one of them, and that's a contributing factor as well. Rami, I'll hand over to you for the question, Simona's question on the core.","Rami Rahim","Thanks for the question, Simona. I'll say that this market, whether it be core routing or edge routing, has always been a very competitive market. And I certainly don't expect any of our competitors to stand still. I operate -- we innovate under the assumption that both Cisco and Alcatel are going to be releasing new products, as they both have. It doesn't change the strategy that we are executing towards and the fact that I remain very confident in the technology that we're developing and releasing into the market. I mean, the fact remains that the PTX is still the only platform of its kind in terms of the efficiency of which it can move packets around. So it appeals to the transport buyer. T Series remains the best investment section. It's been out there for a decade. It's still growing. It still has excellent capacity. And then, as I also mentioned in the past, the 2020, the MX2020, now gives us an architectural approach that blends services throughout the entire network, edge and core, and that also is resonating with many of our customers. So I remain confident in the technology that we're -- that we have today. And of course, were not standing still either. We're working on next-generation silicon, next-generation software, to make sure that we maintain our competitive edge.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You are proactively pruning the headcount. Would you consider extending or pruning to the product portfolio? If I look at the Enterprise, for example, the routers there are down 50%. Security is better now, but it was -- it's been somewhat inconsistent and even for carrier WiFi -- enterprise WiFi products. So I'm wondering, are there benefits to becoming more focused and less broad? Or do you feel that with the return of the carrier router cycle, that perhaps you'd double down in some of the other investments?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. Let me comment on that, and then I'll let Rami add to it a bit on the product portfolio side. But let me just say, first of all, we have been pruning the product portfolio. I think one example of that is MobileNext. And just to give you some perspective there, when we launched the MobileNext project, it was part of an overall strategy to continue to increase our push into the wireless side of the business. And we continue to see good growth in the wireless side, as evidenced by the strong performance we've seen on the MX and some of the core convergence projects that were doing with PTX. And now, with the introduction of the ACX in the backhaul, I think all those things have helped us continue to strengthen our position in the wireless side of service providers. In addition, the inflection point of network function virtualization and SDN, we believe, is going to create a paradigm shift in how evolved packet core solutions are deployed. We believe that's going to become more of an x86 virtualized network function, and something like Contrail will play a role in service chaining and help enabling that. And so we took a decision to cancel that project. And so that cancellation of that project is pruning the portfolio and is part of this reduction in the headcount that we just spoke of. And I think there is a number of examples of smaller things like that, that we are doing. Now specific to your question on routing, and you said enterprise routing was down, keep in mind these are the same routers that we sell to service providers. And much of -- well, part of the reason it's down is related to the U.S. federal and other large entities like that, that have similar attributes to their business like service providers. So unless we took a decision to start to prune the portfolio in our core business and service providers, which I don't think makes sense, these are the same products that we sell to many of our large enterprise customers. But certainly, we do believe that the strategy we're on is one of narrowing our focus. We've been very clear that our focus on the service provider, and specifically the domains of the core and the edge of their networks, and now with ACX on the access layer of their networks, as well as their data centers, and that data center priority, is one that then crosses over into enterprise. You will hear more about some new things that we'll announce in the data center here later this month. And then certainly, there are some areas that we'll continue to assess, but we're very committed to the fact that monetizing our investment in R&D across both service provider and enterprise, with products that sell to both, is the most leveraged way to drive value, both for our shareholders and for our customers. Rami, let me hand over to you and let you -- see if you -- if there are things you want to add to that or amplify.","Rami Rahim","I'll just add a couple of things. I think you've covered it well, Kevin. The engineering principle that we're applying to our strategy are really all around focus and high leverage. If you think about what we've done in the past, for example, in focusing our investing dollars in the MX as opposed to spreading them across multiple different edge platforms, that is an example of a strategy that has worked very well for us and an example of what we are essentially doing now. I want to make sure that we solve our customers' high-performance networking problems with the fewest number of high-quality differentiated platforms as possible, and that's essentially what we're doing. We want to make sure that we're leveraging between our data center and our campus. We've done that in our organizational designs. Between service provider and enterprise, we've seen tons of opportunities to do that as enterprises start to seek the same sort of carrier class capabilities in their platform. We're doing just that as well. So I think these are just some of the principles that we're applying that have worked for us well in the past and will continue to work well for us going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Subu Subrahmanyan of the Juda Group.","Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division","My question is on the switching business. Could you talk about, excluding the lumpiness, what are the other drivers you're seeing going forward? Is it share gain? Is it new products that you're releasing in the data center? And can you talk about QFabric versus a standalone best-of-breed product strategy, how we should see that play out in 2014?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes. Subu, thanks for your question. Rami let me hand this one to you, and I'll let you talk a bit about our switching portfolio.","Rami Rahim","Certainly. So the major driver that we're seeing right now for switching are in data center and combined data center\/campus opportunities. We execute at -- a good fraction of our business goes to enterprises that are building common cores that serve both their data center and their campus. 10-gig upgrades are still happening. They're coming strong from the growth in our 10-gig ports across our portfolio. SDN, as I mentioned earlier, the discussion now is about making sure that our customers are equipped with the infrastructure that can help them move through the -- sort of their SDN strategy, whether it be one with our own controller, Contrail, or one with our partner controllers, for example, VMware. We did not break out the QFabric versus EX performance. At the end of the day, we have multiple different fabric options that will solve various different problems that our customers need solved. The Virtual Chassis and the EX, QFabric and the QFabric architecture are both different options. And depending on who you're talking to or what problem you're trying to solve, each one will have a sweet spot in terms of its applications. And yes, as we did say, we're at -- revenue was essentially flat year-over-year. The bookings momentum that we saw in terms of growth gives us confidence in -- and backlog that we built, I should say, gives us confidence in the next quarter. And Kevin did mention that we are going to be announcing somewhat shortly some new innovations in the spaces that are going to help us and only increase our confidence.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Could you talk about services expectations for the fourth quarter? You mentioned there were some renewals that didn't get signed, and maybe that implied some services revenue pushed into the fourth quarter. I wasn't sure. And then just on Federal, is it still about 4% of sales? And what did it do in the quarter? And what's in your guidance for Federal? You said qualitatively. If you can quantify any of that around federal, that would be really helpful.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. Ben, thank you for the question. On the first question around services, so we did see a slight decline in the revenue quarter-over-quarter. We do expect that to come back over the next couple of quarters. We also saw a drop or a decline in the gross margins by about 2 points, and we do expect that to come back as well over the next couple of quarters as well. So the services business is very healthy. On the support side, obviously, as our footprint grows, we need to continue to make sure that we're there for our customers in terms of maintaining the products that we have out in the marketplace. So that's why the gross margin came down a little bit. In terms of the federal revenue, about a year ago, I gave you the percentage of about 4.5% of total company revenue and that, that had come down over the previous year. On a year-to-date basis, including the revenue in the second quarter, the routing revenue that we've talked about in the second quarter, we are at about that level, at about 4.5% on a year-to-date basis. I expect the fourth quarter to be weaker than what we typically see, and therefore, the percentage of overall total revenue for the year to be lower than the 4.5%. I hope that clarifies it.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Obviously, service provider continues to move in the right direction, but enterprise is down a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about sort of your partnership with IBM in conjunction with Pure and what else you're doing to address this kind of pre sort of configured pre-integrated stack? I think EMC earlier this morning talked about 50% year-over-year growth in their Vblock. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that? Then perhaps a quick update on the CEO search process and where we stand with that.","Kevin R. Johnson","All right, Brian, thanks. Let me hand your second question first, and then I'll frame your first question, and then hand it off to Rami. On the CEO search, on our last earnings call, I commented that the board have put together a search committee and it started a search. I would say that we're in the later stages of the process, and I would expect -- there's no news to announce on that today, but I would expect that when they conclude, we'll make that news available, certainly, and just remind you that in the interim, I will continue to fulfill the role as the CEO and will make sure that I'm available to have a smooth and thoughtful transition to my successor. So the update is I think the -- I would characterize the board as being in the late stage of that process. Your first question around the enterprise, I think a couple of things as -- certainly as Robyn highlighted, there were some weakness in Federal. And we did see some good results on our SRX sequentially on the security business. And then I think as Rami commented, our bookings for switching, we saw some good year-on-year growth with bookings and switching. You put that together, and I think there were some good signs of some progress and momentum there. The relationship with IBM, I think, continues to be a very important one to us. They're a key partner for our go-to-market in the enterprise. I would say much of that relationship is anchored on the services side of their business and what we're doing to help enable their services side of the business. And there are certainly opportunities for us to continue to expand that. Your question specifically then is how are we addressing the integrated stacks of compute storage and networking that we're seeing on the market today. And for that, let me hand over to Rami, and he can talk a little bit about the work we're doing with IBM in that area. Rami?","Rami Rahim","Yes, Brian. This is certainly an important segment of the market, and this is precisely why we have created a partnership with IBM to make sure that we do have an offering that can satisfy that part of the market. But I will just point out that it's not only about that. There are the large sets of our customers, especially the very large customers that are looking for much more modularity, open interfaces between the various different stack elements in their data center, and we're well equipped to have those discussions, especially as a result of partnerships that we have with EMC and VMware and CloudStack and OpenStack, and so forth. We want to promote an open ecosystem of the different sort of software and hardware stack elements that will appeal to many of our customers. So both segments of the data center markets are really important to us, integrated and more disintegrated, if you will.","Operator","The next question comes from Amitabh Passi of UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I had a 2-part question on security, and then one for Robyn. Kevin or Rami, just on the security side, can you give us a sense of how the service provider market is? We're hearing some noise in the market of increasing competitive pressure in that market. Just wondering how you would characterize the environment for your Service Provider security business. And then, Kevin, just related to your data center strategy, is there any -- or are there any metrics you can give us that give us a sense of how WebApp and Spotlight are developing? And then, Robyn, just one for you on the OpEx front. If we assumed 5%, 6% growth next year for top line, how do we think about OpEx progression for 2014?","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes. Thanks for your question, Amitabh. I'll take the first on and then hand over to Robyn for the second one. The first part of your question was related to security, specifically in the service provider market. And the specific area that we are focused on with that is securing the LTE network. So the mobile Internet of our large wireless carriers. And we've had a significant number of wins and success in that area. And the key driver is the fact that these require very high end systems to handle large amounts of traffic. And the high-end SRX has been a very strong offering for service providers in securing their LTE networks. We don't see a lot of competitive threats in that particular area of the service provider, which is where we're focused on security. Certainly, service providers have other security needs in other areas, whether it's data center, their own campuses. And certainly, there are competitors in those areas. But when it comes to securing the LTE mobile Internet, I think we continue to feel like we've got a strong position, and we enhance the product to have even more scale and the ability to handle more concurrent sessions and more throughput. I think some of the evidence is just the sequential growth that we've seen on our high-end SRX, is evidence of supporting that. On the data center side, your question was what do we see that -- with WebApp Secure and Spotlight. With WebApp Secure and Spotlight, we're now seeing some of the early stages of the deployments and the implementations of those. By the same token, we're seeing the high-end SRX that goes into data centers, that sequential uptick was also contributed by wins in the enterprise. And a number of these enterprise data center wins with -- in the area of security, in many cases, would fall into customer segments like financial services and Federal government that also have very large data centers and high-end computing needs. So there's no specific data that I can give you on WebApp Secure and Spotlight today. I would say it's -- we see sort of -- customers are now in the process of going through the early stages of deploying. We're starting to see deployments increase. But it's still early in that cycle. But it does -- those deployments do reinforce the value of the high-end SRX, and we did see good sequential uptick on the high-end SRX. Robyn, I'll hand over to you for the second part.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes, Amitabh. In terms of the OpEx side, obviously, as a company, we're committed to growing revenue and also to continue our journey on the operational excellence front. And we've done a pretty good job, I think, in terms of managing operating expenses and to reduce the overall cost structure of the company over the last 12 months or so. As we move into next year, obviously we're not at a point where we can give you guidance on that, but I will refer you back to our operating model, where we've talked about being -- OpEx as a percentage of revenue in the 39% to 42% range. At the midpoint of guidance that I gave you for Q4, we'll be approaching that 42% range. It's about 42.5% at the midpoint of our OpEx guidance for the fourth quarter. So my view is that's where we're headed into the long-term model range as we move through next year.","Operator","The next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see if you could update us on the target for new products. You mentioned on the call and the prepared remarks that you are at $110 million for that set of new products. You've, in the past, talked about exiting the year at $150 million. I'd like to get an update on that target, as well as an update of how the mix has evolved in terms of your expectations on those new products.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thank, Simon. I'll start, and then I'll let Kevin comment as well. So in terms of the third quarter, we were over $110 million of revenue on the new products. And as you will recall, there were 5 products that I talked about at FAM a year ago in terms of what constituted that $150-million target. It was T4K, the T4000, the PTX, QFabric, and then we also included ACX and MobileNext. It is very fair to say that the 3 products, T4000, PTX and QFabric, make up the bulk of the revenue in the third quarter. And they have done -- over the past few years, I've given you updates against that target. We feel very good about the pipeline that we have and about the design wins that we have across the board in terms of our T4000, PTX and QFabric, and the momentum on ACX is starting to build. And so we're 90 days away from the end of the fourth quarter, so we'll report out against that target in the fourth quarter. But we feel very good about where we are in the cycle of new products that we've launched. And don't forget, since we've talked about these byproducts, we've also launched some pretty compelling new products in the MX2000 series, both the 2010 and the 2020. And we've also had quite good revenue against those products as well as we've developed through the year as they've been out there for a quarter. I'll let Kevin comment as well.","Kevin R. Johnson","Yes, thanks for the question, Simon. I think the -- when it comes to the core routing, whether it's PTX or T Series, I think we saw good sequential uptick on T4000, and we've done a lot of work to lay the foundation for that. And as Rami mentioned earlier, PTX continues to be a good performing product for us. Key on us achieving that will be continued evidence that service providers are shifting or complementing their CapEx expenditures that we currently see on the edge and complementing those with continued upgrades and continued investment in the core. And we saw evidence of that in Q3, we'll see how that unfolds in Q4. The ACX addresses the access layer of the network, and I think we're seeing some beginning traction in the ACX. And we'll see how that unfolds as well. That's a newer product in the product family, but it does reinforce the strategy we have of focusing on the wireless service providers with a product set that gives us mobile backhaul. In terms of data centers, I think the -- we had a very strong quarter in Q2 with QFabric. We continue to move forward with some of the key QFabric wins that Rami mentioned, and this is both on the service provider side, as well as the enterprise side. And I think there's a number of deployments. I think Q4 will be a function of how many of those new systems get deployed, combined with how many of the existing installed base customers expand their networks. And then I think, in regards to MobileNext, we commented earlier on the call that we had canceled that project based on what we see happening in the market with a shift more towards network function virtualization. So I think the mix shift of perhaps what we expected to what we will see, we're probably going to see a higher percentage certainly in core versus the MobileNext, and I think Access will be probably about what we expected. And data center, I think, will be about where -- perhaps where we expected when we set that target a year ago in June. So the mix has slightly changed, but not too far off. And I think the key factor is going to be what we see in terms of SP CapEx focused on the core, as well as some of these big data center deployments with QFabric.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay, thank you.

Traditional networking boundaries are changing and as a challenger in this industry, we here to shape it and lead it.","Throughout last year, I committed to focusing on innovation, operational excellence, cost discipline and our targeted growth initiatives. I am pleased to report that in 2015 our total revenue grew 7% year-over-year excluding Junos Pulse driven by growth across all verticals, geographies and technologies.","Product and service revenue were up across routing, switching and security. Service provider and enterprise revenue was up by 7% and 8% respectively. We improved our operating margin and delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth.","So I'm proud of what we've achieved but there is still more to do to continue on our path of operational excellence, innovation and growth. We are leaving in disruptive times and we are witnessing some megatrends unfold. The competitive landscape is evolving; new architectural approaches like SDN are becoming real. Business models are changing with software desegregation and white box switching. The future of security is evolving and everything is shifting to the cloud. What does this all mean for Juniper? We intend to be the most trusted technology provider helping our customers to solve their most pressing networking problems. We see incredible opportunities ahead and we intend to capture it.","Today, there are about 700 million broadband users worldwide and an estimated 940 million by the end of 2018. This is driving an insatiable need for network capacity. To illustrate this point, Netflix recently announced it is now serving a 192 countries up from 60 plus. Imagine satisfying this increasing worldwide demand for rapid low latency and high volume communication of information. They will require new high performance highly automated networking solutions and cutting edge technologies.","In 2016, we planned to continue to capture inflection points in the industry that will help to accelerate our existing strategy. We planned to do so through continued execution and product innovation as well as partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions when appropriate that complement our organic R&D strategy.","For example, we see new growth opportunities in the data center interconnect and metro Ethernet markets. Traffic growth in the networks that form this market is forcing our customers to consider new architectural approaches to keeping up with traffic demand cost effectively. Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire optical equipment provider BTI Systems. By combining Juniper's data center switching and IP routing platforms with BTI's cloud and metro networking systems and software, we expect to transform packet optical networking and provide our customers with open software driven solutions that are automated highly programmable cost efficient and offer tremendous service agility.","It is now more evident than ever that everything is shifting to the cloud. Enterprise IT is moving apps and data to public and hybrid cloud. Service providers are building out a distributed telco cloud to drive down operational cost increase agility and better serve their customer. Cloud is often required new and network infrastructure build and upgrade across wide area networks, datacenters and branch offices. And our customers recognize the value of Juniper's networking innovations to help in their transition to cloud architectures. Our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operations of network and to allow our customers across our key vertical to deliver real valuable over those networks. We anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue overtime.","I remain optimistic about our entire product line and across routing, switching, security and automation software has spent five solution domain, datacenter, core, EDGE, Campus and branch and access and navigation. We shipped several new products last quarter including the ATX-500 hardened access switch, the GFX 5200 top-of-rack data center switch, the SRX 1500 security platform for the campus and branch domain and the newest generation of MX Line Card, the MPC7. These and other new products are getting good early reception from customers and we expect them to ramp in revenue this year.","Now I know cyber security is top of buying for organizations of all sizes. Investing in security is an imperative for our customers and Juniper strategy. We believe the future of security is intimately tied to the network and we are investing and innovating in our domain solutions with that direction in mind. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity, security and insurance of all of our products at Juniper.","Again this backdrop that I've laid out and given our assumptions that the global economy will be volatile and customer investments maybe lumpy, my team and I had set out the following three operating principles for managing the business in 2016.","First, we intend to take a prudent stand while going after revenue growth opportunities that we see within our target markets. Second, we will remain diligent in managing our operating expenses and intend to expand non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2016, we reiterate our long-term target of operating margins of 25% on a sustainable annualized basis.","Third, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and continue working towards an optimized capital structure. We will seek to fulfill our commitments to continuous process improvement in execution and I look forward to share and yet more accomplishments that provide value to our customers and return for our shareholders.","I want to thank our employees for their continuous pursuit of excellence and their sincere commitment to helping our customers every day.","Before I conclude I would like to say a few words on the leadership transition that we announced earlier today, Robyn joined Juniper as our CFO over 8.5 years ago and has since led the finance and operations organization through a period of extensive change and frankly significant accomplishments.","I\u2019ve always been impressed with Robyn\u2019s willingness to put customers first and bring her great energy and enthusiasm to some of the most challenging times our company has faced. Robyn has developed in outstanding finance IT and operations organization and has still a strong operational and financial discipline in the company complementing and strengthening our heritage of innovation. Robyn I thank you for being a great business partner, not only with me but the entire Juniper senior leadership team and the board over the last 8.5 years. And thank you for stepping down in the thoughtful way you have with the great CFO successor to take over after filing the 10-K in late February and staying on until the summer to ensure a smooth transition.","And you have been in Juniper since before the IPO and I know you have been in all parts of the company over the 16 plus years and know the company inside and out. In your current role as the SVP of finance, you have worked closely with Robyn and me in helping to instill the financial discipline that has resulted in our strong performance in 2015. I also know that you appreciate where this company has been but more importantly are mindful that there is still more work to do to really achieve our full potential. We are confident that with your leadership we will continue in this new path of operational excellence and diligent and prudent financial management.","Continuing to strengthen these attributes of our culture are essential to our future successes. Robyn thank you and Ken we look forward to your new role. And with that I will turn the call over to Robyn for review of our full year and quarterly financial results.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you Rami and good afternoon everyone. I'm very pleased with our record fourth quarter 2015 results. They reflect strong year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth.","We saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both Americas and APAC as well as solid growth with service providers across all technologies. Specifically, telecom, cable and cloud providers each grew revenue more than 20% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, seven were telcos and three were cloud or cable providers, of these customers five were located outside of the U.S. reflecting our continued strategy to diversify our revenue across multiple vertical and geographies.","Our underlined demand metrics continued to be healthy this quarter with a products book-to-bill greater than one and ending product backlog at $517 million up 16% year-over-year. Sequentially productive differed revenue was flat and up 7% year-over-year. I'm especially pleased that for the quarter we delivered strong year-over-year and sequential non-GAAP operating margin, an earnings per share expansion. This reflects our continued good execution focused on revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure.","In the quarter we had cash flow from operations of $117 million lower than the previous quarter primarily due to working capital requirements. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million. We repurchased $93 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014 inclusive of share repurchases and dividends we've returned approximately $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.","Now, I'd like to discuss our annual results. Our fiscal 2015 results were strong with year-over-year revenue increases across all vertical geographies and technologies. As anticipated in the second half of 2015 U.S. tier 1 telcos showed an improvement compared to the first half of 2015 as well as the second half of 2014. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year 5 were Telco, 3 of which were outside of the U.S. and 5 were cloud or cable providers. For the year we expanded operating margins significantly by 3 points and grew diluted earnings per share by 40% on a non GAAP basis which reflects our followed execution focused on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share counts.","We are pleased that we were making good progress through our annualized long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue. And towards our non-GAAP operating margin target of 25%. For the year we had strong cash flows from operations of $893 million primarily due to higher revenue and improved operating margins. Capital expenditures for the year were $210 million as we focus on investments to draw a long-term productivity and support continued innovation and development of new products. We repurchased $1.143 billion of shares and paid $156 million in dividends.","Now let\u2019s take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our Q1 outlook. Although we have good visibility into the first quarter. The mid-term macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential customer investment lumpiness closed very conservative outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong which we impacted into our outlook. You can find the data and outlooks to Q1 in the CFO commentary available on our website.","Now, I'll provide an update on our capital return program. Given that we have substantially through our $4.1 billion capital return commitment. We wanted to give you some color on how we look at our capital return policy beyond the 2016 timeframe. Going forward we intend to target a capital return policy of approximately 50% of annual free cash flow inclusive of share repurchases and dividend. As a reminder in March of 2016 we have $300 million of debt maturing that we currently intend to refinance subject to market and other business conditions.","Also yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire BTI Systems. Please note that we expect the transaction to close in Q2 and we will provide more information on the financial data of the combined operations after the transaction closed. At this point, we don't expect the transaction to have material impact throughout 2016 earnings.","To summarize, I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished in this year which is reflected in our results. We are executing well against our long-term model and as we begin the year we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitments. For the past 8 and half years I have been privilege to be the CFO of Juniper. We have accomplished a lot over this time and I feel really good about where the company is positioned and the financial and operational disciplined that is in play. I also believe that the company is in great hand with Rami and with Ken as we move forward. And I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitments to Juniper's success.","And now with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark Moskowitz","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of quick questions here, one just in your comments about trying to inject more conservatives and more prudence around the outlook. Can you talk about relative to what you're seeing in terms of the macro? Have you seen anything what's in your customer base that is you found to be somewhat incremental or calls per calls in terms of one customer vertical staying the narrow at one product segments and that as part of the certain see a major change in the sales most of that relative to sort of prior few months. And then I have a follow up.","Rami Rahim","Yeah sure, Mark. Thanks for the question. I'll start and then I'll just pass it on to Robyn if she wishes to want to add anything else.","First and foremost, I have to say that I feel good about the fundamentals of the business and of course the need for networking technology across all of our market verticals. The fact of the matter is there are some very important problems to be solved in the area of networking keeping up with capacity and delivering services over those networks and so forth. Also feel great about our execution, the engagement that we have with our customers across all of our key market verticals. I think it really comes down to the fact that 2016 has started with a lot of market volatility. And we have to see how that plays out in terms of its effects on spending patterns and deployments with our customers really across all of our key verticals. I think it's really important that we managed the business and we invest with that assumption in mind and that's exactly what we're doing.","Robyn Denholm","Yeah, and just to add to that. I mean we did really have a great Q4 and we got good visibility. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the backlog was $517 million up significantly year-over-year and so as deferred revenue. Having said that as Rami mentioned, there is a lot of market volatility out the and in our experience that has from time-to-time caused some lumpiness in our deployments or order patterns. And so it's more a buyback cautiousness in terms of what could unfold as we move forward here. But we've been cautious with our guided for the first quarter.","Mark Moskowitz","Okay. And then the second question is more longer term in nature thinking about the second half of '16 and into 2017, Juniper and your leadership have done a nice job in terms of refocusing on both security and switching and we're hearing that a lot of big customers are starting to really keep it tie and bring Juniper for in for some other piece with this. Kind a curious if you talk about the cadence there the sales motion and are you having to hire more people one. And then two, is this more of a 2017 potential or it could be a second half of '16 in terms of meet again a boost of on those initiatives in both security and switching thank you.","Rami Rahim","Yeah thanks. Sure Mark. Thank you. If you look at 2015, we said that it's really important for us to diversify our business across geos across technology areas, across market verticals. You're touching on the diversity and technology areas. And that is very much a matter of our strategy and I'm very happy with how the team executed to that effect in the last year. Routing all up grew 6%, switching 7%, security grew 5%. And that I think is a reflection of just the execution by the engineering team the go-to-market team our marketing team.","And I feel that the opportunities there for us to continue that growth across all of the technology areas, in security in particular since you highlighted it, this was an area that required an extra level of focus from us. Because as you know we started with a bit of deficit just a year ago we refocused our strategy, we enhanced our product set, we definitely did a lot of training and marketing to win the hearts and minds of our partners and our customers. And while I'm not yet ready at this point to say that we are completely done because there are still a lot more execution for us to do in the area of security. I definitely feel much better about the opportunity that we have with that business and the way that we are executing in that business than I did a year ago.","Mark Moskowitz","Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay, thanks Mark. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yeah. Hey, good afternoon hi Rami, Robyn. Quick question from me around you mentioned your guidance was conservative primarily on the uncertainty you're noting in macro order lumpiness. You also noted weakness in US enterprise. So my question for us is if you could give us any color on the lumpiness comments which product segment are customer set of customer that's coming from very helpful.","Rami Rahim","Let me start Vijay. I don't think it's any it's specific to anyone technology area or customer vertical. As I mentioned I actually feel good about the way that we're executing and about the fundamentals of the business the need for the kind of technologies, how our products that we're developing and innovating in are going to addressing those requirements in 2016 all up. I just believe that as we start 2016 and you see the incredible amount of volatility in the market across really all markets and all geos, it's a good idea for us to plan and manage the business with the assumption that there could be some lumpiness. And I don't think if they say specific to anyone particular vertical.","Robyn Denholm","Yeah, and just amplify what Rami said, and just to remind you our enterprise business typically is down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. That's a normal phase and no pattern that we've see. So obviously we expected it to be up year-on-year but quarter-on-quarter we do expect that to be down and Rami addressed that in his prepared remarks. In terms of the Telco sector just globally we had a very strong Telco quarter in the fourth quarter as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. And typically it does take a little bit of time to those deployments to be digested and move forward. So we're constructive on the year I think in terms of how reviewing the FY16 year for our business. But we're been cautious in the near term just give the volatility as Rami mentioned.","Vijay Bhagavath","A quick follow up is on the BTI announcement. I mean we personally think it's a strategic positive for the company getting into data center vertical in particular. So the question for you is around how do you manage margins because optical margins as you all know more in the high mid-to-high 40s your margins at in the mid-60s. So help us understand the margin put and takes that optical getting into your portfolio. Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yeah sure Vijay. Well first I'm happy to hear that you think it' a good idea and I agree with you completely. I wanted just to make sure everybody understands. The goal of this acquisition is not to build a large optical business inside of the Juniper. The goal is to capture what we believe are very important market inflection points that have to do with the convergence of packet and optical. And this is not a new strategy, this is actually strategy that I've talked to you and our customers and our partners about over several years. We have already been developing optical interfaces, colored interfaces on our routers.","And we think that there are certain market segments data center interconnect in particular metro that are going to need to move to this architectural approach sooner rather than later. And so this acquisition when it closes in the Q2 timeframe is essentially a way for us to accelerate our innovation in this area by getting key building blocks and of course the talent that will help us to do it. So that's why as Robyn mentioned earlier we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a material impact on our 2016 financials.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks Vijay. Next question operator?","Operator","And the next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks Rami and Robyn. I hate to ask you but just a clarification of the last two responses in the question a little clarification I appreciate and first of all we appreciate the prudence given the macro backdrop but I just want to make sure I understand when you talk about being prudent in the lumpiness one month in I recognize it's not very long it generally it\u2019s always a late month for the first quarter but have you actually seen things that cause you concern as opposed to reading a lots of journal in CNN or listening to all the other companies had announced?","And then my question will be on margins you had really strong services gross margin number relative to what you\u2019ve done over the last year to in product gross margin was somewhere between the real question going forward what should we expect is the 63 plus you did in service is that in your norm were there extraordinary things in the quarter that accounted for this strength and some more question on products.","Robyn Denholm","So Paul thanks for the questions. Let me touch on the guidance and the outlook for Q1 first so as we said if I go back 90 days ago what I said on the earnings call is that we expected Q1 to be 7% to 10% down and what we just announced in terms of the guidance at the midpoint is 11% down so it's modestly down from what we were expecting before and that\u2019s us being cautious and prudent.","We\u2019re not seeing any wholesale signs as any weaknesses Rami mentioned before, having said that it is early in the quarter and it's just our experience that where there are headlines we\u2019re talking about capital purchases many of my piece around the world will start tighten things unless macro environment changes and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re being cautious and prudent it is more experienced than actually what we\u2019re seeing.","So on the margin side I'm very pleased with the gross margin that we posted for Q4 it\u2019s up a couple of ticks\u2019 year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. It is strong in terms of both the product and the services margin. The services came and the business around services is doing very well within the company, the team continues to work on the cost structure. They continue to take cost out of that business and productivity increase. At the same time, it\u2019s improving our customer satisfaction score so I'm very pleased with that.","We move to the first quarter guidance on the gross margin, we also typically see a quarter-over-quarter sequential decline in gross margins again it\u2019s up year-over-year from Q1 of last year and that\u2019s primarily the result of the volume in the Q1 period of time from products so this is relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter in terms of the gross margin area. Sometimes we do get some fluctuation in that depending on deployments from product because of PS revenue as part of services but we\u2019re very pleased with our services gross margin.","Paul Silverstein","Robyn I wish you well.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks Paul. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Pierre Ferragu","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So maybe on the outlook you\u2019ve pulled together and the comments you made about uncertainty do you have like a differentiated view when we think about your plans so did you have more or less the ability for service providers, vertical plans, enterprise and so how does that look like from a regional standpoint, so we see very clearly your very good performance today is mostly driven by the U.S. Are you concerned about a slowdown, a domestic slowdown as well or is still most of the uncertainty in international market?","And then maybe along with the same line one last question what\u2019s your view on the data center spending so we've seen a few data points recently potentially showing the data center spending could be slowing is that something you see something you anticipate? Thanks a lot.","Rami Rahim","Yes, Pierre so let me start first as far as the outlook really I think Robyn covered it well. There is nothing specific to anyone particular vertical or even geography. The macro volatility we're seeing is really widespread and it touches pretty much all of our customers across verticals and different geos as well.","On the second question that you are talking about with respect to data center, I still see that as a tremendous opportunity for us. We are.... if you look at our switching market share although it's actually nudging up were still relatively small and for that reason the opportunity for us to penetrate into the data center with switching products, data center interconnects with our MX product line as well as some of the packet optical architectures that we are talking about and data center is in fact the area where we are strongest today from a security stand point.","Finally, where we are really seeing some good momentum is with Contrail and build out of cloud for Telecom operator and large enterprises. The Contrail win rate that we are observing right now with six additional wins in the Q4 time frame alone is really healthy and we definitely see a pulling other products along with it. So macro uncertainty aside I still view data center and in particular the move to hybrid cloud environment as a tremendous opportunity for Juniper.","Pierre Ferragu","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski","Hi, thank you very much. If we look across the networking landscape, there are a few significant upgrades that seem to be kicking in this year. Couple of the carriers are moving their metro networks to 100 gig, cloud providers are moving to 25 and 50 gig in their data centers. You see enterprise data centers moving to 40 gig and then campus is moving to multi gigabyte. Of these four opportunities or any others you may want to add which ones are you involved in and which ones do you think are going to be meaningful growth driver for you this year?","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Thanks, Simona. I'd say the biggest areas of focus and where our competitive differentiation is going to be greatest as well as where our go to market attention is also the highest is in the data center opportunity. So you mentioned correctly. So they moved to 25 and 50 gig, we just introduced in the Q4 time frame the key effect 5,2000, in fact that's the first switch that we offer with a completely dis aggregated operating system to truly go after that opportunity. That compliments the spine switches that are now in the hands of our customer at least the early versions in the hands of our customer whiles we expect revenue to start ramping this year.","So anything to do with data center just as a matter of strategy and focus I'm optimistic about. Metro 100 gigs the MX is the sweet spot product now for these 100 gig deployments and I do expect to be very much relevant if you will for those kinds of opportunity. Campus has been a little bit less of a focus relative to the data center. But that's only because of the timing of the product if you will. We have a new architecture that we introduced for the campus that we call fusion architecture and that architecture really comes to provision and around the middle of this year and for large campus environments I think that makes us very, very competitive.","Last, on the metro opportunity. We did mention that we introduced the latest versions of our MX line cards in the Q4 time frame. This is the MPC7 with a very dense industry leading 100 gig capacity which is perfectly time to capture the metro opportunities that you are mentioning.","Simona Jankowski","Great, thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks, Simona. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jess Lubert","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First for Rami, I was hoping you could touch on some of the factors driving the strength in the routing business which posted a second consecutive quarter double-digit growth. So any insights you can provide as to where you believe we are in the customer routing cycle to what degree you think the new PTX and MX line cards can continue to sustain helping growth in that business through 2016 that would be helpful.","And then Robyn I was hoping you could perhaps touch upon to what degree you expect currency to impact the outlook and perhaps some of the exchange rate assumptions that are embedded in the forecast. Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Okay, let me start with routing. Thanks for the question and then I'll pass it over to Robyn. In routing over the last few quarters, we've been taking market share and I think that's because of the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement that we're having with our service provider and enterprise customers around the world. Last quarter was a great quarter for the MX and the PTX this quarter is another fantastic quarter for the MX. So there are really two routing product lines that are humming right now in terms of the business momentum that we are building. Both have fantastic roadmaps and both are hitting the market in terms of both the software capabilities the services and the density and the performance that they offer to our customers.","In Q4 in particular, we saw broad based strengths in service providers, this is not a common specific to just the large tier 1 this is true for service providers around the world that are building out their metro their EDGE and their cores with the MX and the PTX. And I'm also very pleased with the performance that we saw in the cable in the Q4 timeframe where cable operators are really just trying to keep ahead of the growth in video traffic. They're doing this with the migration to DOCSIS 3.0, 3.1 and of course the densities that we offer with the MX and the PTX to help them to do that is really turning into a competitive advantage for us.","Jess Lubert","Rami based on the availability of the new products, is there any reason we shouldn't expect some of the share gains we've seen in the last few quarters to continue?","Rami Rahim","Share will always fluctuate on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but if I look at the win rates as well as the opportunities that are ahead of us and the product roadmap. And you have to keep in mind that we have actually managed to achieve the strength that we achieved in 2015 largely without the new products ramping up. This year I think we have the benefit of the new products ramping up which I think can help us in sustaining the market share momentum. Robyn?","Robyn Denholm","So just in terms of currency Jess. As I've mentioned before, we predominantly invoice the U.S. dollars. Having said that obviously with the strength of the U.S. dollar versus other currency, we see some and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, some modest pricing impact in those areas which we have by and large offset with cost reductions. So our assumptions are that the currency impact remains the consistent high levels of the U.S. dollar as we move forward here.","Jess Lubert","Thanks guys.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks Jess. Next question Mannie?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Sanjiv Wadhwani","Thank you. Rami let me just wish you good luck on your next venture. Rami broad level question for you within the context of a volatile macro. I was wondering if you could comment on how you see sort of that you're shaping up. I know you guys have talked about the 3% to 6% especially given the various new products that are starting to gain traction. So just curious to get a comment of how do you think that year might shape up thanks.","Rami Rahim","Well first thanks for the question Sanjiv. We're still sticking to our long-term outlook which includes '14, '15 and '16 of the 3% to 6% revenue range. And I think we will make progress towards if I look at 2016 all up. I do believe that we will make progress towards that goal. And that\u2019s true from a revenue standpoint in terms of 3% to 6% but also through from an operating margin standpoint where we expect to achieve our long-term goal of 25% all up full year annualized basis.","Robyn Denholm","And Rami made '15, '16,'17 we announced it in '14.","Rami Rahim","Thank you for the correction Robyn. You're absolutely right.","Sanjiv Wadhwani","Just and quick follow-up as it relates to new products I mean are you expecting material sort of contribution this year or do you think this sort of ramps up as a year progresses and maybe in 2017 you'll start seeing more of the material contribution.","Rami Rahim","It's both because I think it ramps up but it ramps up early this year. So I do think it will have a significant contribution to 2016 across switching and routing in particular but also security.","Robyn Denholm","Yeah, and just to underscore that point and Rami mentioned that in his prepared remarks, the 2015 there was very little revenue from the new products. So it just it underscores the strength of the results in '15. And we are expecting those products to ramp as we move through '16.","Sanjiv Wadhwani","Got it. Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks Sanjiv. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you and congratulations. One clarification question then I have a follow up, so first of all the clarification question. You mentioned the currency and we know you priced mostly in US dollars and you mentioned some changes which will be offset by your cost which you've been able to do. Can you give us a little bit more detail about what you meant by those changes was that be as you lowered your price in certain geographies or you did some more rebating or what's do you mean by those changes need to be offset by cost that's a clarification.","And then my main question is a lot of the other questions were asked on the other products but on switching. Can you give us a little bit of details on switching kind a maybe what's happening now versus say six months ago and kind of your outlook for switching whether be trends or product cycles, thank you very much and again congratulations.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you. So in terms of the pricing commentary or the currency commentary. Obviously the U.S. dollar has been strong for quite some time now. So we have actually seen some impacts from our pricing in on international operations outside of the US which we have largely offset by the cost reductions that we've had throughout the year. So you can see the gross margin is very healthy on that product areas it's very consistent year-over-year it's also very consistent from a sequential basis. So we obviously compete in the business and we largely compete on the differentiation of our products. But there are obviously areas where we continue to work on the cost structure and reduce our cost so that we preserve the competitiveness of our overall product ranges well.","Rami Rahim","Yeah, and Jim on the switching question, fiscal year 2015 we saw a 7% year-over-year increase in switching that is largely without the benefit of the new spine switches which we expect to ramp in this year. So I am bullish on our ability to grow this part of our business. I think if you look at where the opportunity lies; it's mostly in the datacenter and the cloud. This is true for all of our vertical market segments whether if that our telecom operators that are building out their next generation distributed Telco cloud architectures transforming their network locations to scale out data centers from which they are delivering value to their customers certainly through for enterprises that are moving to a hybrid cloud architecture. I think we can benefit from that. And then again I will put in that plug for - because I think that's really making us very relevant to the next generation architectures where there is a high degree of automation that is being applied how switching is deployed. And we're seeing that is a very strategic and sticky part of the sales motion for our customers across all vertical markets.","Robyn Denholm","Yeah and just to underscore that point, we grew switching 7% year-over-year without very much benefit at all from the new product. So I think to Rami's point we're very pleased with the switching performance that also plays with how we out moving forward from a competitive point of view with the switching line up that we have.","Jim Suva","Thank you and congratulations.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks Jim. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah hi. Thanks. This is Ashwin [ph] on behalf of Rod. Hey good.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay actually question is on Europe it looks like Europe was down on a year-over-year basis in Q4. I'm wondering if you're expecting that region to return to growth anytime soon given that fiscal your Q1 guidance implies growth.","Rami Rahim","Yeah, sure Ashwin. So Europe actually you're right, from a revenue standpoint it took a little bit of a step back but actually from a booking standpoint Europe was quite strong year-over-year and sequentially. So I'm not concerned. I think in Europe the area where we're seeing the greatest success is with the telecom operators. The win rate, the level of engagement on some of the next generation of architectures in not just routing but in switching and security and Contrail is very good and so for that reason again for 2016 as a whole I actually think Europe is going to be good. There has been a very deliberate focus inside of Juniper to make sure that there is the good diversity across geographies and we\u2019re taking that seriously I'm very pleased with how the team is executing.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks for the color. Just one more follow up Rami you\u2019ve commented that you\u2019re expecting operating margins to expand in fiscal \u201816, I wanted to understand how contingent is that on revenue growth coming through and I just wanted to understand your planning assumptions there?","Rami Rahim","Yes, I think we are expecting that revenue will expand this year if you think about it from the full year standpoint and with that said we\u2019re essentially making sure that we\u2019re investing in a way that is commensurate with that expansion in revenue. We\u2019re not going to as I have said many times in the past invest ahead of that growth.","Robyn Denholm","Okay, great.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you the next question is from George Nadar [ph] of Jeffries. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks a lot guys. I guess more of a housekeeping question I was curious about what your emerging markets exposure is right now I\u2019ve seem to have lost track of that I'm specifically just in countries like Brazil, Russia, China places where the currencies have really devalued or economy slowdowns where is that now and how do you feel about those areas going forward? Thanks.","Robyn Denholm","Thanks George. We don\u2019t actually breakout our emerging markets number but what I will say is I did provide some commentary about Asia Pacific if you excluded China we\u2019d actually be up quite significantly in terms of the quarter. It\u2019s in my commentary and in terms of Brazil, it\u2019s a small business for us but I can\u2019t actually say we\u2019re down in the quarter and that\u2019s in the Americas result, so in terms of the APAC results they would have been up I think it\u2019s about 10% but we\u2019ll come back to you with that number.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks George. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steve Mironovic [ph] of UBS. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you. I was just wondering there was some news about Facebook\u2019s open compute project getting the back in telcos like AT&T, Verizon, Deutsche Telecom wanted to get your perspective on that and what you\u2019re hearing when you talk to customers?","Rami Rahim","Sure, thanks Steve. This is an industry where most of the innovation and the investment goes into software but much of the business model are tied to hardware I mean if you take a look at Juniper as an example 85% of all of our development resources are software resources that is where the crux or the majority of our R&D investment actually lies.","I do believe that overtime business models will adjust so that\u2019s more of the value is going to be monetized through software and I think we\u2019re taking meaningful steps in that direction. So in the Q4 timeframe we announced our disaggregated architecture, our customers were very pleased we got a lot of kudos if you will from our customers, telecom operators and enterprises mostly on the telco side that this is the right step to take.","Do I believe that there\u2019s going to be an overnight shift in business model, no I don\u2019t I think in this industry everything is sort of unfold and multi-years but I do think that we are taking the steps necessary to make sure that in a world where wide box switching starts to become more prominent that we will be able to participate, to add value and of course create shareholder value from that transition as well?","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. And Robyn there was a comment in the formal remarks about moderately elevated pricing pressure have you addressed that in your comments so today are you seeing something competitively that\u2019s different?","Robyn Denholm","No it\u2019s a combination of factors but we did address it obviously the currency impacts is seen through that pricing and any other factors that are in there. But we are offsetting that with cost reductions as you could see in the quarter from the gross margin so slightly elevated just what I said in the prepared remarks. And just coming back to George\u2019s question about emerging markets in terms of Asia Pacific it was about 4% full year, we excluded China region we\u2019re eventually up a little bit so you can see there has been a sustain period of time, quite a reduction in that business. Although I will say that it in the fourth quarter we actually saw it grow a little from the third quarter. So from a China specific perspective.","Kathleen Nemeth","Great, thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Ittai Kidron","Thanks. Couple of questions. First, Rami can you get into the enterprise business and the performance in the fourth quarter. I have to go back 10 years and I never could have found a quarter where your enterprise business took such a significant decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So you can give us a little bit more color on what's going there. That will be great and second just wanted a big picture standpoint. Do you have any view on what capital spending will with carriers this year? How it's going to be waited second half versus first half, any color on that will be great?","Rami Rahim","Okay. Let me start. Thanks Ittai. On the enterprise side Q3 was a very strong revenue quarter for us. If you recall it was actually double-digit growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So the step back that we took in enterprise honestly I'm not too worried about it. I think that is largely as a result of the timing of large enterprise deployment and especially government. Government was actually very strong for us in Q3 and there was a bit more weakness in government just because various factors in the Q4 time frame. If I think about the opportunity for us in the enterprise and our ability to capture it especially as it pertained to cloud deployment. I actually feel very good about 2016, all of 2016. I think that's the net of it. Expecting some one peanut especially in the larger enterprises in government is something that is pretty normal.","Robyn Denholm","Yeah and actually I'll just add to that, our enterprise business for the fourth quarter was largely as we were expecting. So not anything out of the ordinary. The full year for enterprise was actually 8% which is a very good result for us for the full year rental price and it just speaks to the diversity again that Rami underscored through the commentary here. If you look at our full service provider business that was up about the same sort of level, 7% and enterprise was up 8%. So within any one quarter you will see some lumpiness between the sectors and between the verticals in the market. Just because of the deployment cycle that actually overall the diversity is working us and that it gives good gross in both areas over a full year period of time.","Rami Rahim","On the second question I think it was around sort of the capital expenditures for telecom operators in particular. I mean we are seeing the same reports that you are seeing it's still early that in the year. But it is at least one of the factors that we are considering as we provide our outlook. For Telcos in particular the most important thing we need to do, it is to make sure that we remain extremely relevant to the next generation architectures that they are now contemplating and will eventually deploy. Things like cloud CBE, things like deploying SDN and transforming their network locations to data center like entities. I feel really good about the level of engagement that we are having with our telco operator to be able to capture that opportunity when it becomes real. I think there are some real good proof points of telcos. Even large telcos that are making significant progress in that direction.","And then finally, it's important for us to continue the diversification of business. So that we can increase the predictability of our business overtime across all vertical market segment.","Ittai Kidron","Very good. Good luck.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, Ittai. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Fall [ph] of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Thanks very much. And Robyn I'd like to add my congratulations to you and appreciation for all your help with me over the years.","Two questions really I think first is big picture on routing you had a really nice series of quarters and they were quite good on that, I contrast that a little bit to what I hear out of the larger U.S. Telcos who have been pretty clear that NFE is an opportunity for them to reduce spending on what they call big iron in the core of the network. So I'm wondering if you could compare and contrast that a little bit and help us I think that through and then I've got a follow up. Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yeah, sure. I will start with this routing question. I think actually where if you look where you see virtualization becoming most relevant. It's in areas of the market that are tend to be little bit less performance tend to be more around the customer premises equipment is really around the end goal of automation. And we have developed of what I think are really competitive solutions to address that particular opportunity. The big iron stuff - it's really around keeping up with traffic patterns with growth in traffic. And if you look at for examples the enhancements that we are making in the PTX where we're going from a terabit per slot to 3 terabits per slot industry leadership from form standpoint. I can tell you that is absolutely hitting the mark in terms of the kinds of technologies that are telecom operators are looking for to cost effectively address the insatiable based our traffic growth in their networks.","Robyn Denholm","Jeff your follow-up?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thank you. And then the second one is could you help us a little bit to understand when we can expect revenues from the QFX-10000 I think that still at one point and might have been in the first half of this year and I'm not sure if I A have that right in B if so I'm interpreting your remarks is being more of a second half 2016 story.","Rami Rahim","We well we expect the revenue ramp to start in the first half. It will obviously be more meaningful in the second half. But we do expect that the revenue will start in the first half.","Robyn Denholm","Yeah, I think it's fair to say that we expect that those revenues in the first half that right will start in the second half I think is the way we would characterize it.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah, okay. Thank you to both for helping me parse through that language.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks Jeff. So we are running up to the hour. We have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly, our final question is from Jason Muland [ph] of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks for slipping me in. I had a couple of quick ones hopefully and thank you for giving the color on the top 10 customers. And the question there with more success in cable and cloud is Rami as the business becoming more concentrated around key customers or is that the wrong way to look at it.","Rami Rahim","No I think it's actually getting more diverse across vertical markets, cloud, cable telecom operators large enterprises federal governments and so on. And I think that's good because it's adding a greater level of predictability to the business. I don't think we're done I mean I think that there is always going to be some lumpiness I mean our exposure to telecom operator is still quite high so there is going to be some lumpiness to the business which is why so important for us to continue in 2016 on our strategy of diversification across vertical markets across geos and also across technology areas of switching revenue security.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then a quick follow up. On the comments about volatility across all markets and geos and then with security specifically ScreenOS is all but gone and you've got traction at the high end of the SRX market. Should we expect to see more resiliency in security relative to other market just given the nature of that business.","Rami Rahim","Yeah I have said in the past that this 2015 will be the year of stabilizing security and then we would start to see modest growth in 2016. So at the end of 2015 I think it's we can say that we exceeded our expectations last year. Securities grew 5% full year year-to-year comparison. And I think that's not an accident it is a result of some really great work by a lot of people to Juniper that I'm extremely proud of.","There you're going to see a rolling thunder of security enhancements that we will make across managements, where we knew that we have some work to do to better penetrate the enterprise with the area of next gen firewall capabilities that are cloud offered that this product is called the sky advanced threat prevention that's in beta today that essentially starts to ship shortly in the next few months.","We just wrapped up a customer and partner events actually more of the partner events just earlier this months, where we heard first hand from our partner that they are feeling much better about where we are in the security today relative to where we just a year ago.","Unidentified Analyst","Appreciate the color. Thanks Rami.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thanks Jason. And thank you everyone for joining us today. As always we appreciate all of your great questions and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."],"12514":["Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) Q4 2013 Earnings Call January 23, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Kathleen Nemeth","Shaygan Kheradpir - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Robyn M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here on the call are Shaygan Kheradpir, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer. Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Platform Systems Division, will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]","With that, I'll turn the call over to Shaygan.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to be here on my 23rd day at the company and on my first quarterly conference call with you. It's an honor to be selected as Chief Executive Officer of Juniper and to lead the company at this exciting time.","My first 3 weeks have been busy. I have and will continue to engage with our customers, employees, investors and other key stakeholders. I am actively reviewing the company's business lines, operating model and capital structure. We are building up a strong base. We delivered record revenue this quarter, good growth on year-over-year basis and a strong book-to-bill. And I continue to see substantial opportunities for Juniper to grow and deliver value. As you will hear shortly, my initial priorities are centered around developing an integrated operating plan, which is focused on profitable growth and shareholder value creation. I will present the details of this plan to you more fully in a few weeks.","Before I hand it to Robyn, I want to share with you why I made the decision to join Juniper and provide some insight into my and my team's initial priorities. First, I see a great opportunity with an iconic and pioneering company that has phenomenal assets, technology and people that can address our customers' most pressing requirements. Juniper uniquely leverages its strength in systems, silicon and software to build the kind of networks that fits where our customers want to be and importantly, where the market is evolving to: high performance, agile, secure, automated, context aware networks in an open framework. I know this because I've been in this industry for 27 years as a customer, in both the service provider and enterprise sectors. I understand intimately their environments and imperatives for new revenue growth, speed-to-market, service quality, operational and capital efficiency and how to put Juniper's portfolio to work in powerful ways that matters to customers.","To achieve this, Juniper needs to be the leading provider of high-IQ networks and best-in-class cloud builder, where the network is the most sensitive piece of the puzzle and has to be the first mover. I intend to play an active role in guiding this transition. But I'm also here as an agent of change. Specifically, I believe I can leverage my operational experience, as well as my deep engineering and technology background to drive effective and efficient business operations and lead Juniper through the changes required to reach its full potential. In short, this is an outstanding platform for which to deliver a great customer value proposition and substantial shareholder value.","Since arriving at Juniper, I've been interacting with the key stakeholders and analyzing our revenue streams, including what customers are buying and for what use cases. This information reaffirms my view of where the markets are headed and where Juniper has the most significant competitive advantage. I can see our heritage, secure, high-performance networking, open architectures and deep engineering talent, converging with this future. This, I believe, will position Juniper as a world-class provider of innovative, high-IQ networks and cloud builder across our customer base. This includes not only our strong base of service providers and public sectors customers, but also newer customer segments such as Web 2.0, cable, content and financial services, as well as other customers who all want clouds and high-IQ networks.","I also recognize that we have work to do. So my team and I are already hard at work, developing an integrated operating plan that addresses 3 key priorities. Firstly, we are tailoring our strategy to focus on innovation that matters to our customers and where we excel, bringing in the outside in customer imperatives. I intend to restore Juniper's focus on thoughtful, highly value accretive innovation and rebuild the get-it-done culture that unleashes the talent of our people. Additionally, we will implement a more efficient cost structure, commensurate with our strategic focus and the competitive environment, resulting in reduced costs. I'll be taking a three-pronged approach: focused R&D that matters, radical simplification on automation and rightsizing. We will do this in a smart way, with an eye towards returns on investment and focusing on the cost drivers, such as operational leading indicators. This is something I've done before and I'm confident can be effectively implemented at Juniper. Lastly, we've been taking an in-depth look at our future cash flows and capital structure to assess how we can best return capital to shareholders, while still maintaining the financial flexibility to invest for future growth. We're actively evaluating the capital return policy, which includes level of share repurchases and dividends.","While the company has been working on the areas of cost structure and capital return for some time, since I've joined the team and I have been full-on, on strategy, cost structure and capital return and we resolve to deliver meaningful results in this area. We will do this with an emphasis on disciplined execution on business fundamentals. I look forward to announcing and sharing with you the details of our integrated operating plan in the next few weeks. You have my commitment that the plan we present to you will be well considered, specific and achievable. I also look forward to spending additional time with our shareholders and analysts in the coming weeks. And as we have said previously, we are very interested to continuing a constructive and open dialogue with our shareholders. I've been talking about what I've been doing and will continue to do in the next few weeks. As I indicated, Juniper had a strong Q4.","And I now hand it to Robyn to take you through the details.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thank you, Shaygan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our Q4 2013 results reflect strong sequential and year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. We had a record revenue quarter, driven by strength in both service provider and enterprise. Non-GAAP earnings increased sequentially due to higher revenues, partially offset by high variable operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, we completed the restructuring actions that we announced 90 days ago. We have been comprehensively analyzing our cost structure in the context of our strategy and, as noted by Shaygan, we will provide additional details on our integrated operating plans in the coming weeks.","Looking at our demand metrics, we had a very strong bookings quarter, with book-to-bill greater than 1 and net backlog at a very healthy $471 million. While total deferred revenue was up $48 million quarter-over-quarter, product deferred revenue was down $35 million sequentially, primarily due to strong channel sales, resulting in lower ending channel inventory and the timing of certain future feature releases.","Total revenue was $1,274,000,000, up 7% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Product revenue was up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 15% from a year ago. Services revenue was also strong at $300 million, up 5% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year of 2013, total revenue was $4,669,000,000, up 7% year-over-year. There were no 10% customers in Q4 or for the full fiscal year, which reflects the continued diversity of our business.","For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.30, including a $0.04 pretax impact from restructuring charges and a $0.04 benefit from a lower tax rate. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.43, up $0.10 sequentially and increased significantly $0.15 year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven primarily by high revenue and operating margins, which were at their highest level since Q1 of 2011. For the full fiscal year, GAAP diluted earnings were $0.86, up $0.51 for the year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $1.28, up by $0.43 or 51% year-over-year.","Now let me provide color on revenue by region, market and product area. Americas revenue was up 4% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. Americas service provider revenue was down 2% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. The trend in bookings, however, was notably different, as we saw strong bookings in the Americas service provider business, up more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to see strength across the customer base, especially in cable and content or Web 2.0 providers. Americas enterprise grew strongly at 16% sequentially and 29% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in both financial and federal sectors. EMEA revenue was up strongly at 17% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven by strong service provider performance in Germany, U.K. and Eastern Europe. EMEA enterprise also rebounded nicely in the quarter. APAC increased 5% sequentially and 18% over Q4 of last year. Both service provider and enterprise grew in the region. While we are encouraged by the performance in the quarter, there's still some work that needs to be done to get the region growing on a more consistent basis.","Service provider revenue for the quarter was $827 million, up 5% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, with good new design wins across all 3 theaters. Enterprise revenue was $447 million, up 12% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, with broad-based strength across the customer verticals. For the full fiscal year, service provider revenues were $3,054,000,000, up 9%. And enterprise revenue was $1,615,000,000, up 4%. While the growth was across all customer segments, content and cable were the key drivers. It is worth noting that over 50% of the total revenue growth in 2013 came from the web services content and cable customers.","Now let me review our revenue by product area. Total router product revenue was $618 million, was up 1% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. While routing revenue in the quarter was healthy, bookings were very strong and grew over 20% sequentially and over 30% year-over-year, driven by MX and PTX product lines. In addition, our newly released MX104 router is off to a solid start. For the full year, router product revenue grew 14%. Total switching product revenue was a record $199 million, up 35% sequentially and 36% from a year ago. This was driven by strong sales of EX and QFabric. And we are very pleased with the EX design wins with top enterprise and service provider customers and key data center wins, which resulted in significant sequential and year-over-year increase in QFabric revenue.","In the quarter, we also shipped the QFX5100 top-of-rack switch and expect it to be a very good contributor to our switching portfolio going forward. For the full year, switching product revenue grew 15%. Total security product revenue was $157 million, an increase of 9% sequentially. Bookings also increased sequentially for the third quarter in a row. We saw a moderation in the decline on a year-over-year basis to 7%. As I've noted in the last couple of quarters, we have begun to see good signs in this business and customer feedback is encouraging. So while revenue for the full year was down by 16%, the last few quarters of demand indicated that we are in the midst of a turnaround.","Our new products, as designated by the Financial Analyst Meeting in 2012, including T4000 PTX, QFabric, MobileNext and ACX, generated slightly less than $140 million in bookings in Q4, short of our goal of $150 million. Since we set the goal, we eliminated the MobileNext product and have also introduced a number of other new product lines, not included in the above goal.","Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 64.2% compared to 64.4% last quarter and 65.3% a year ago. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 64.9%, down slightly over the last quarter, mainly due to product mix. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 61.9%, up 0.6 points from last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $539 million, an increase of $10 million sequentially and higher than we expected. This increase was primarily due to high commission-related costs due to the higher demand and an increase in legal expenses. Absent these items, our operating expenses would have declined sequentially.","I had mentioned at the last earnings call that we would be undertaking some restructuring and rebalancing actions in the fourth quarter. We executed to that plan and eliminated 248 positions, of which 112 were in R&D and 95 in sales and marketing. We ended the quarter with 9,483 heads, down 231 heads or 2% sequentially. In the quarter, we took an $18.9 million restructuring charge, of which $13.9 million was related to headcount action. For the full year, operating expenses were $2,102,000,000 or 45% of revenue, down from $2,124,000,000 or 48.7% of revenue for the 2012 year. This reduction was in spite of legal expenses in the year that were approximately $30 million higher than expected. As Shaygan outlined, we are focusing on making changes to the overall cost structure and will present that plan to you in a few weeks.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter expanded to 21.9% compared to 19.8% last quarter and up strongly over the 18.2% last year. The sequential increase was driven by higher revenue and an improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. For the full year, operating margin expanded by 23% to finish at 19.2% for the year. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.8% compared to 25.5% last quarter. This improvement is primarily due to the geographic mix of income and some onetime items.","Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion of net cash and investments. We generated strong operating cash flows of $390 million due to the higher operating margins and our continued focus on the cash conversion cycle. Q4 DSO was 41 days, down from 42 days last quarter. Capital expenditures were $50 million, while depreciation and amortization expense were $45 million. We repurchased 11.8 million shares for $242 million at an average price of $20.47. We had $1 billion remaining on our current authorization. And as Shaygan previously noted, we have been working on our capital allocation policy and we will present this strategy, along with our integrated operating plan, in the next few weeks.","Now I will review our outlook for Q1 of 2014. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We believe that the underlying demand trend for our markets will remain healthy in 2014. We expect the March quarter to reflect typical seasonality in the top line. And as a reminder, we see a Q1 increase in OpEx as a result of the impact of FICA taxes. We also expect legal expenses to continue at their elevated levels that we've seen since Q3 of last year. Please note that our outlook for March does not include the potential impact of activities related to the execution of our Integrated Operating Plan, which we will be sharing with you within the next few weeks.","For the first quarter of 2014, we expect revenues to range from $1,120,000,000 to $1,160,000,000. At the midpoint, this reflects a growth of 8% year-over-year, highlighting our expectation of continued momentum in the underlying demand. At the midpoint of guidance, gross margins are expected to be in the range of 64%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be flat to slightly down from the fourth quarter. At the midpoint, operating margins are expected to be approximately 17%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.27 and $0.30 per share and assumes a flat share count. We expect a tax rate of approximately 25%, assuming that the R&D tax credit is approved by the end of March. If it's not approved, the tax rate may be higher by 1.5 percentage points and would impact EPS by about $0.01.","To summarize, we anticipate overall demand to remain healthy and we will continue to focus on our innovation and our operational excellence objectives. I would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.","And now with that, let me turn it back to Shaygan for some final thoughts before we take your questions.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thank you, Robyn. I'm excited to begin this journey with you and leverage my experience and expertise as a customer and operating executive and a technology innovator to drive value for all of our stakeholders. And I very much look forward to meeting with you, listening to you and presenting our Integrated Operating Plan in a few weeks.","Now to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ehud Gelblum of Citi.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So a couple of questions, if I could. Clearly, on the revenue side, guys, switching was incredibly impressive. Strong as it's been in -- certainly from a growth perspective, in [indiscernible] in forever. QFabric seems to be doing very well. Can you give some insight as to what got QFabric going now? And is it all top-of-rack switches, is it just a -- I mean, are they actually deploying real QFabric, are they just using the top-of-rack switches instead of the EX? And was there a new sales plan, was there a growth in the VAR channel, was it new products or something that really -- what really got QFabric going? And if you can give us a little bit of insight on the security side, which was nice and strong as well, was it new products, was it something of that sort to give us a sense? And then Shaygan, you've been here now for, I guess, 2.5 weeks. You said you're going to come out with a much larger plan on business model on the company going forward. Clearly, there's an activist involved that might be leading you to that. Do you think that coming out in 5 to 6 weeks after you got there is the right time, or do you -- would you actually rather have longer to take a look at the company and maybe come out with a plan, maybe 12 to 15 weeks? And if so, should we be looking for successive revisions to whatever you're coming out with, as we go forward and you learn more about the company?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Hi, Ehud, and good speaking with you. I'll take both of those questions and I'll then pass them to Rami and Robyn, they can drill in on your switching question. So first of all, I came into the company, of course, being 25 years in the industry as a technology builder and as an operator. So I have a great deal of understanding of what the customers are really looking for and, more importantly, where they're going. In fact, that's connected to the switching question as well, which I'll come back to. And obviously, I spent my last 3 years at an investment bank with my telecom expertise. So I came in with a lot of thoughts and an understanding of the company. And from the second that I was announced, I've been sort of working myself and now -- since January 1. So we're in full motion, getting started here. As far as -- and I'll pass to Rami -- I think the very first thing I did, Ehud, when I first came here, I've been peppering everybody with questions of, yes, we know they bought, they're buying a lot, who's buying and why? And the why piece of it has pretty much reaffirmed what I thought, from a customer angle, which is people are buying pretty much the same things across multiple customer sets for the same reason, which is everybody's trying to build, what I call high-IQ networks and cloud ecosystems. And as you see in our switching results and in our security results, it sort of jumps out. Those are key components of high-IQ networks and cloud ecosystems. We'll have a lot more time to talk about this when I meet you all. But I'll now pass to Rami to drill in on this, Ehud's switching question.","Rami Rahim","Sure. Thanks, Shaygan, and thanks for the question, Ehud. On the switching side, first of all, yes, we're certainly very pleased with the results that we saw in Q4. A couple of things that I will say, over the last year or so, you know that we have been in the process of essentially integrating our 2 separate switching business units. As a result of doing that, we not only streamlined the portfolio, we actually simplified the portfolio and focused it on the most pressing problems that our customers are solving today. So if you take a look at the result, a lot of the performance that we saw is, it came from that hard work in new products that we introduced just last year, like the EX4300, the EX -- the EX9200 are both examples of those products. And then from a market dynamic standpoint, we have large customers now, both on the service provider and the enterprise side, that are building a cloud network that require the kind of high performance products that we are developing. And they love not only the product themselves, but the tie-in that we have developed with our SDN solution, whether it be Contrail or with our partner at SDN solutions like VMware.","Robyn M. Denholm","And just to add to that on the security side, so we saw good growth sequentially in terms of security. And we moderated the decline year-over-year. What's driving that growth is the same that's been driving the bookings growth over the last couple of quarters and that is high-end SRX. And it comes back to the theme that both Rami and Shaygan talked about in terms of data center and what we're doing with our service provider customers as well as our enterprise customers. And so that is what drove the growth this quarter, the high-end SRX.","Operator","The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Robyn, I was just trying to reconcile the commentary around strong bookings with what appears to be slightly subseasonal guide. You're guiding revenues down 10%, 11%. I think the last 3, 4 years, it's been down 7%, 8%. So I would just love to get some incremental insight. Was there some one-off orders you saw of revenues this quarter that you think won't repeat? Would love to get some clarity on the guidance relative to the bookings commentary.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thanks, Amitabh. So on the actual guidance for Q1, at the midpoint of guidance, what we're reflecting is an 8% year-over-year growth. And our perspective is that the business is healthy across the board. We've got good design wins in all 3 geographies across the business areas. In Q1, it typically does take us a little time to get moving, if you like, but we're very pleased with the demand fundamentals that we have across all 3 areas of the business.","Operator","The next question is from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My question is for Shaygan. Shaygan, I wanted to ask, have you -- within the plan, not that you can go through the details, but have -- is there any feeling about the product line at Juniper in your initial thoughts? Is there -- are you wed to any products or is everything deserve a full look? And then just my second part of the question, if you don't mind, is you went through the 3 points you'll address in the plan, I was just wondering if accountability will be part of it and you will tell us how we can hold you accountable for whatever we do here to make sure that the promise is fulfilled, sir.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Hi, Ben. And also hi to Amitabh, I both look forward to seeing you both shortly. So as far as the -- I'll start with the second one. Accountability is one of the big tenets of our plan, which is we're going to have a detailed Integrated Operating Plan, which includes who's going to do what, when are they do it and discrete milestones that we can track with tangible observables and make sure we are on course. The reason it's integrated and we can't do this thing in piece parts, as you well know, Ben, is that it starts with, what is your strategy, where can you win? That goes into what customers want. Where are the markets going, what are your strengths that you can win in those markets? We have to get that down and we've got a lot of progress already on that and there's good convergence and thinking with the team. So that's on that. That flows into your structure, your company structure. That flows into your cost structure. And the cost structure, you probably have an unfair advantage because you are from Barclays. It sounds similar, right? We focus on markets. We focus on automation, on process improvement, 21st century industrialization, you would know that term. And then you'll focus on rightsizing, to make sure we are sized right for the anticipated volume of the business. All of these things gets wrapped in. And then from there, you flow into return of capital. And you wrap it all in, in an integrated plan, detailed milestones with hard accountability and you can hold us accountable quarter-after-quarter for results. And I'm holding my team accountable, personally, for their pieces. And we know how to do this. I've done this all my career. And the team here is excited and energized to hit the afterburner button, so to speak. So be assured of that.","Operator","The next question is from Subu Subrahmanyan of The Juda Group.","Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division","I wanted to understand, Robyn, a little bit more on the routing side. Routing growth, you've mentioned orders had grown much more strongly than revenues. If you could clarify that? And then U.S. service provider down in traditionally seasonally very strong quarter, can you just talk about what the dynamics behind that were?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. Thank you, Subu. In terms of your question, from a routing perspective, we were very pleased with the routing performance in the quarter in terms of the sequential increase and year-over-year increase. We had a 1% increase sequentially off a record quarter last quarter for routing and a 16% year-over-year increase. And the strength of that is amplified in the bookings. So and that's why I called it out. The trend on revenue, as you know, sometimes follows the trend in bookings, but not always the case in terms of the one quarter view. So I wanted to add some color in terms of the bookings in routings which were very strong. And as I said, they were up over 20% sequentially and over 30% year-over-year. So the team has done a very good job on driving the design wins to bookings in the quarter from a routing perspective.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions, if I may. First off, on the security, I thought I heard you call out the high-end SRX in particular is driving the security. My question to you on security is given this sort of lumpiness of the high-end SRX and your efforts in the branch SRX, can you share with us insight on the progress with branch SRX? And the other question, on the service provider routing piece, can you comment on the competitive landscape in pricing in particular Alcatel-Lucent and Huawei, as well as the new Cisco core routers, if that's having any impact in the landscape.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thanks, Paul. I'll comment first on security and then I'll hand it over to Rami in terms of the competitive landscape in routing. If you look at security, we've had 3 quarters in a row now of good sequential bookings growth and it is coming from the high-end SRX. As we've talked about, that product set, we sold both into service provider and into enterprise. And the service provider buildouts are lumpy, as we've called out before. What drove the growth this quarter was actually enterprise, was the predominant reason for the high-end SRX increase. And we've talked about it in prior quarters in terms of some bookings momentum on the data center side. But on the revenue side, that is what was behind the growth in high-end SRX this quarter. And so, on the routing competitive dynamics, Rami?","Rami Rahim","Sure, certainly. The competitive situation for routing hasn't really changed. This remains a very competitive industry in the -- so the way in which we compete is essentially the same. In the Edge, for example, it's about having a single unified, the most complete, most scalable, highest performance, Universal Edge, which is the MX, which is really growing nicely for us and competing very well there, both with incumbents and new players. In the core, yes, there are different dynamics that are happening here. Certainly, there are sort of incumbents and new challengers that are coming in, but I would say that, that has not, again, changed the way in which we compete. It's a high leverage strategy using our massive T Series deployed base. It's an architectural approach to packet optical transport with our PTX. And we're actually seeing some pretty good early momentum with the MX2020 for high service rich cores around the world. In certain geos, like you mentioned, there are sort of geo-specific competitors, like in Asia. And there, it's just about being laser focused on the areas where we believe that we have the highest amount of technical differentiation. That's why we're successful.","Operator","The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.","Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Shaygan, I had a question for you. You talked about your views on strategy influencing your approach to cost cutting and rightsizing the business. And I just wanted to ask you if at a high level you still view the strategy as staying in both service provider and enterprise is the correct strategy for Juniper? And then conceptually, how you think about businesses in which you may have a relatively small market share, such as switching, for example, in which your share is about 3%? Is that the kind of scale that you think is sufficient to keep investing in the business?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Simona, good speaking with you. Look forward to meeting you. We have -- as part of the Integrated Operating Plan, we have one big work stream around our R&D. And so I'm actually personally involved in that one, too, given my engineering background and the background in networks. What I would tell you, Simona, is when I entered here -- so we do all the work and then we'll present to you in 3 weeks or 4 weeks or whenever that is, in a matter of weeks. But we -- what customers are buying, the customers says, we're looking at and I count them and this is sort of from my perspective coming from the customer side, these are not necessarily a taxonomy that some of you may have used in the past. So you've got our -- a great service provider customers, which is like AT&Ts and Verizons and BT and DT and down the chain. You have those sets of customers. Then you move into the cable and content and then Web 2.0 customers like Google and Amazon and the rest. And then you move into special enterprises, yours being one, Goldman Sachs and all the companies that are represented on this call. Those 4 sets of customers, with a little bit -- maybe a few others, like federal government and so forth, they pretty much are all coalescing around the same set of things, as far as networking is concerned, which is clouds and high-IQ networks. Rami talked about and Robyn talked about the key components, MX, QFabric, PTX, SRX, with the big brain called Contrail. Essentially, that's what people want to buy because they're trying to solve some very specific business problems that we'll get into when we sit down with you and go over it. So the markets are changing for a set of these customers and we just have to make sure that we will be able to win and win big in these markets, given our heritage of high performance networking, only really pure play company out there in IT networking in high performance, in open architectures, carrier-grade, super big SRX, defending the cloud and so forth and so on. And in fact, this was my view when I came in as a customer, being on both sides, operating obviously at Barclays, CIO, CTO on Verizon. And in fact, the buying -- or what people are buying and the mix is sort of confirming that. Now as I've said it last quarter, this has to continue, but it has certain logic to it. So I think that's the -- that's what in my mind, if that helps.","Operator","The next question is from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I want to ask what I think is a pretty quick one and then maybe more involved. First for Shaygan, if you could just maybe articulate how the activists have either influenced you or not influenced you starting in on your job. And then I wanted to follow-up on the guidance in that you highlight a number of areas with very strong bookings, so that leads us to try to figure out what's weak or are you suggesting a much better than seasonal growth rate in the June quarter?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Well, thank you for the question. As I said, I've been in this business now exactly 27 years. And so I come in with a lot of views on where the markets are going and what the customers want. And I think that is -- since I've been actually a builder in these companies, so I have great appreciation for building. And since I've had tens of thousands of people in my organization, from an operating perspective, I was the heart of sort of operations. So I come in with a good view of what is a well-run operation. I come in with a view of what the customers want. And I come in with a view of technologically what's the art of the possible and where the markets are going. So I sort of took this job because I saw great opportunity at this phenomenal company, sort of ready to go, to put in play 27 years of my experience. So that's on that end. On the other end, obviously I am on a big listening tour and our shareholders is one of the most important stakeholders. I've been listening to shareholders, I continue to do that and the investors and the sell-side and the buy-side analysts and of course our customers to pull all this in. And we also have urgency of action because every month that passes 2014, I want to make sure the new Integrated Operating Plan is in place, the company is behind it and we can move and drive shareholder value and make sure that our customers get to solve their business problems, which is all around, how can I generate more revenue? How can I bring down my operating costs? How can I make sure I don't get hacked? And so forth and so on. These are -- when you put a customer hat on, these things -- when you actually live and sweat the details in a customer, these are -- get a different gravity. So I'm actually very confident that we will be able to come up with a great Integrated Operating Plan and put it in motion and really solve our customer problems and in the process drive great shareholder return. And just hold on for a few weeks and we'll unveil it.","Robyn M. Denholm","So on the guidance question -- in terms of the midpoint of guidance, as I mentioned before, is an 8% year-over-year growth, which is actually -- reflects our confidence in the strength of the underlying business. Our view is that there is a sequential -- sorry, seasonal pattern to our Q1 business, particularly on the enterprise side. And we saw in the fourth quarter, the enterprise actually drove a lot of the year-over-year growth. And so what I want to make sure of is that we take that into account. That's what we've taken into account. The underlying demand trends are healthy. Q1 always has a seasonality to it and we wanted to appropriately reflect that in our guidance.","Operator","The next question is from Mark McKechnie of Evercore.","Mark McKechnie - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Shaygan, welcome. I certainly look forward to working with you. A very refreshing approach here. I had a few questions. First, your background at Verizon and Barclays, 27 years in the business. I'm kind of curious, I don't know if you can expand a bit on your interaction with other carriers and enterprises. I'm sure you work with them, but are the meetings you're having with customers, new engagements or you're meeting with familiar people? Whatever you can say there. And then on the routers, I know people have beaten on this a bit, but I wanted to get a sense. I mean, that was really strong bookings, 20% sequentially. I wanted to get a sense for areas of strength where you attribute that. I mean, is this the PTX big orders here for the U.S.? Are you participating over with China Mobile? Is this Europe? Is it the T4000? I mean, what can you tell us about that? And how you see that playing out through the year.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Sure, Mark, and hi, great to be speaking with you. So yes, somebody asked me that question the other day and said, \"How do you feel?\" And I said, \"Well, I feel like I'm back home.\" In the sense that many of the accounts I go to, they are friends and colleagues from the past. Now as I said, I've been here 27 years, so some of the friends and colleagues have retired, but there's still quite a bit that are still there. And so, yes, I know many of my friends have been there for a long time. We've worked together on the buyer side of things. We have a similarity in thought across the planet. I actually used to chair the CTOs for telecoms a number of years ago when I was at Verizon. And by the way, on the enterprise side, I used to chair the CIOs for a number of years. And so I have a lot of friends there as well. And in fact, my rotation at Barclays, which I have to say was completely phenomenal and magical, I've gotten to be even closer to my CIO friends at the banks and financial services. So yes, it sort of feels in the family but, of course, as time goes on, I become more of the supplier and they become more of the buyer. But at this point, it's very much like coming back home. As far as the routers and PTX is concerned, I'll ask Rami to give us some color on that.","Rami Rahim","Yes, sure. Happy to. Thanks, Mark. So on the router side, I think one of the really encouraging things about the booking was just the diversity in who bought. So we saw strength in our large telcos, even our smaller Tier 2 telcos, our cable operators and also the Web 2.0s. So that diversity is something that we track and something that we consider as very healthy. From a product standpoint, very specifically, MX continues to do very well and the particular applications here that we're driving are convergence of Edge and aggregation networks to simplify operations for our customers, data center interconnect to connect clouds together. And then the other area where we saw some real strength from a booking standpoint is in PTX. As you know, PTX is somewhat of a different architectural approach. So the sales cycles are long and what we're seeing now are the results of the design wins that we had several quarters ago now turning into sales. And the last thing I'll just say is in each of those product line, the MX and PTX, we introduced new specific products in Q4. We introduced the MX104 that takes all of the sophisticated capabilities of the MX down to a very small, power efficient form factor that's ideal for smaller operators and now into the access navigation part of the network. And similarly, the PTX3000 that takes the transport capabilities of that platform and takes it into the metro transport area. So we're expanding the applicable footprint for each of these product lines.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Shaygan, congratulations on the new opportunity. Obviously, some of the fastest-growing workloads on the planet are housed in a lot of the hyperscale guys. And you gave some comments on the conference call with respect to how much that and in conjunction with some other businesses, like cable, are growing for you, over 50% of your incremental growth over the last 12 months. But I guess I was wondering if you care to take a stab, did your hyperscale business actually grow in line with what we estimate is kind of 30% CapEx growth year-over-year? Or perhaps, maybe what percent of your total revenue is coming from this group? 5%, 10%, something like that? Any color would be helpful.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Brian, good to meet you. A really good question. This -- the Web 2.0 and, by the way, the cable and the content businesses are also dear friends of mine for many years, got good insight into those networks, have worked with them for many years. And I'll ask Robyn to take that question around their cloud that they're building and their growth. Go ahead.","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. I think, Brian, in terms of the overall full year, what we wanted to give you color on is where the growth was coming from. And the comments that I made was that it was -- those areas of web services, content and cable actually accounted for more than 50% of the overall growth of the company for the 2013 year. And I think the comment that Shaygan made is very applicable because it's a cross-sector view of those types of companies. And even in some of our traditional companies, there are faster growing parts of that company's revenue with us or their CapEx spend with us, if you like, than other parts. And so that's what we were trying to convey with that comment, that there is faster parts of the market that are growing even in some of the traditional areas, as well as some of these newer opportunities and newer type companies on the web services and cable side.","Operator","The next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Shaygan, welcome aboard and congratulations. So I just had a quick one, I guess, for Shaygan. Can you help us understand how in prior leadership positions that you've taken on, you've thought about the structure of your leadership team? And just as an example, we've had a person take over our company recently as the new CEO and he said, \"I like to have 1\/3 of the people existing managers, 1\/3 internal promotes and 1\/3 external.\" So just any rules of thumb that you think about when you think about structuring your leadership team? And also, just timing on that, how soon do you want to make critical hires if you have to make them? And then I wanted to ask Robyn, if -- Robyn, could you talk to us a little bit about government revenues and what happened in the quarter? I don't think I heard you comment on that. So if could you give us any indication on what federal and non-federal revenues did in the quarter? And then, Rami, I wanted to just go back to your commentary on the switching and also Robyn's commentary on the routing order growth. Can you help us understand what the concentration of those orders is? Like in switching, was it a handful of big customers or is it spread pretty broadly? And then also on the routing orders, is that a few big customers or broadly spread?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thanks, Rod. Thanks for the question. A broad question. As I said, I've had many, many years in this, both Verizon and Barclays, and many -- tens of thousands of people. And I think it's, at the top level, it all starts with what are we trying to do, where are we trying to win. So this is why it's really important to get the focus on product innovation and our markets really right because that flows in what I used to call strength on strength. Have excellent people positioned in the areas that they can put -- push the ball for us forward through excellence. And then it's working as one team, as one Barclays -- I'm sorry, one Juniper, one Juniper, one Juniper. I've had one Verizon, one Barclays, one Juniper, I'm consistent. And then, as you talk to the people about me, it's all the same, right? Because you have success and you repeat that. And then you have execution with no excuses and metabolism execution with no excuses. I look for people who are detail oriented, they're hands on, not a lot of layers, massive focus on the customer, massive know-how internally and really have that outside-in focus brought infused with an inside-out art of the possible, camp on customer's door and execute. And so that's sort of the management philosophy. And now I'm going to pass in to Robyn for the second part of the question.","Robyn M. Denholm","Thank you. Thanks, Rod. In terms of the government business, I did actually call out that the government area -- enterprise was actually very strong in the quarter. We had good sequential and year-over-year growth in enterprise all up. The federal team did an outstanding job this quarter. If you remember back to the guidance that we called out on last quarter, I was expecting federal to be weak this quarter. And actually, the team did a really good job and actually they had a good quarter in Q4. Clearly, the federal business, the government business is down for us for the full year, year-over-year, which also underscores the fact that enterprise, absent the full -- from a full year perspective, absent government, has actually been growing very nicely all year. The other commentary on the fourth quarter was that financial services was strong and that's a global comment. So from my perspective, a good enterprise quarter, a good service provider quarter and a good federal quarter in Q4. Go ahead, Rami.","Rami Rahim","The only thing I will add is, I already added some color on the diversity of customers on our routing side. On the switching side, there too we saw a good distribution between enterprise, especially at the financial services, Web 2.0s, and also service provider. We have said in the past that the service provider component of the switching business can be lumpy. And for this quarter or Q4, I should say, we saw real strength in both SP and enterprise. I think that just based on the -- what we're seeing in terms of demand metric, I'm pretty confident about 2014.","Operator","The final question comes from Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Brian John White - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Shaygan, welcome. I'm wondering, what type of forum are we -- are you introducing the Integrated Operating Plan, you said 3 to 4 weeks. Is this an analyst type meeting or is this going to be a conference call? That's question number one. Number two, maybe talk a little bit about what Juniper is seeing in emerging markets. A lot of peers are complaining about emerging markets, specifically China. Maybe give us just an overview of what Juniper is seeing in emerging markets.","Shaygan Kheradpir","Thanks for the question. On the forum, actually, we are working that as we speak. So stay tuned on that. As far as the emerging markets, Robyn, you want to take that one?","Robyn M. Denholm","Yes. In terms of emerging markets for us, and there are many different emerging markets around the world for us. What I would say, at a high level, our strategy is quite different in some of the emerging markets. You mentioned, for example, China. What we've done at the company is be very focused in terms of the areas where we are most differentiated in that market and Rami mentioned that before. And so our approach varies by market. We're very surgical in some markets where we focus on those areas where we have the most differentiated and we win opportunities in those markets. So from my perspective, our emerging market strategy is different. We sell through partners in a number of different locations through the -- across the world. From a technology perspective, the technology that we sell is consistent and it's in high demand in different parts of the world in terms of that focus.","Kathleen Nemeth","Okay, thank you. That, unfortunately, is all the time we have today. Shaygan, would you like to have a closing comment?","Shaygan Kheradpir","Yes. It's -- I'm thrilled to be here and I'm really looking forward to seeing all of you very shortly and have a much deeper conversation about everything we talked about and hear your views of Juniper and our industry. So look forward to seeing you all. Thank you. Have a great day.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations for Juniper. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may now begin.","Kathleen Nemeth","Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon. And thanks for joining us on today\u2019s call. Earlier this afternoon, we announced our first quarter results and outlook for the second quarter of 2015. Also shortly after the issuance of our financial results press release, we posted to the IR section of our website financial commentary by Robyn Denholm, Our Chief Financial and Operations Officer.","We have also furnished this commentary to the SEC on form 8-K. We hope you find this new format helpful and we welcome your feedback. With me today are today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer.","Today's call may contain certain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, capital return program, and overall future prospects.","Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-Q and the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today.","All statements made during this call are made only as of today.

We delivered solid results for the first quarter of 2015 exceeding our guided ranges. Our strong year of your expansion in non-EPS reflects our continued focus in operational discipline and is a testament to our proven ability to execute on our strategy. We are making significant progress against our key initiatives and we remain steadfast in achieving our outlook realizing Juniper\u2019s full potential. Industry fundamentals are unfolding largely as we anticipated. Based on our visibility and our discussions with customers, we continue to expect an improvement in demand in the second half of 2015.","It has been a busy Q1 at Juniper and I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished in the past few months. We\u2019ve organized our R&D team to innovate as a start-up and unveil the compelling line-up of new products and solutions across routing, switching and security that address real problems faced by our customers and that will make a meaningful difference in the connected world we live in today.","We\u2019ve been listening closely to what our customers tell us they need and a reception from those that I have had early access to these new products has been very positive. Our customers truly value our mission of creating solutions that offer performance and advanced automation capabilities without compromising on scale and reliability. We are enabling our customers to deliver new revenue generating services and a better experience to their customers.","I am energized by all the new opportunities our investments and innovations will make possible. I will now comment briefly on highlights from routing, switching, and security in the first quarter. In routing, we are generally pleased with our execution and progress. Despite the expected sequential and year-over-year decline we still see growth opportunities in routing all out. The diversity of our customers across our focus verticals continues to help offset weakness in U.S. carrier spending.","Cloud providers and cable operators continue to be highlights for us and we are pleased to see solid progress with large enterprise customers such as those in our governments vertical that is opting our routing and SDN solution. Regionally, EMEA returned to year-over-year growth in Q1 and we started to see traction from some key customers in APAC. In the first quarter, we announced enhancements to the PTX product line that make it the highest performing IPU routing platform in the market. Three times that of the closest competitor, empowered by Juniper\u2019s new ExpressPlus silicon.","Coupled with our NorthStar WAN SDN controller, I am confident that we will be well positioned to take routing market share once these products fully ramp. In switching, we are pleased that our mid-to-high end data center business was strong in the first quarter. So, our overall product revenue was down. We expect to continue to grow in the data center with our sales focus and new line of QFX spine switches, which will be the highest performance switches on the market. These switches can deliver unprecedented scale and port density to all types of data center and cloud deployment.","Coupled with contrail and our partnership with VMware, we are well equipped with highly automated cloud data center solutions for both service provider and mission-critical enterprise network. Moving to security, we know we still have work to do to return to growth in this area of our business. Starting in early February, we outlined for customers our expected product direction over the next 18 months illustrating our commitment to offering demand level solutions to have a strong element of security.","Our customers understand the criticality of securing the networks we provide and the roadmap was well-received. Just last week, we announced the in-speeds fastest firewall with 2 terabits per second of performance ideal for bandwidth intensive mobile deployment, as well as large cloud data centers. We are getting in front of our customers security challenges and we remain focused on areas where we can win.","Service has deserved a quick recap as well. We saw a year-over-year increase in service revenue driven by new service contract and strong contract renewal. We continue to help customers through their next-generation network architectures and with the transition towards service agility and automation.","Now to take a step back, the continued expansion of cloud computing and the mobile Internet has broad implications for the technology industry as a whole and for networking innovation in particular. There is tremendous opportunity for us to deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in the network innovation. We believe the industry needs a technology provider that is maniacally focused on IP networking, that's Juniper, that's what we do every day.","We are squarely focused on solving our customers\u2019 toughest networking challenges with superior products and services that transform the economics of networking through high performance and automation. And we have strong relationships with our customers and a robust growth global partner ecosystem that we believe will enable us to win in the marketplace. Our sharpen strategy and focus go-to-market model have come together to drive real competitive advantage for us.","We are executing on our vision to be a worldwide leader of network innovation. We remain resolute in our focus to drive comparable profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. As we continue on our course, I want to thank our customers, our shareholders and our nearly 9000 passionate and hard-working employees for their ongoing support.","Now I\u2019ll return to over to Robyn, who will review a few highlights of the quarter.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you Rami and good afternoon everyone. Before I begin I would like to point out that we posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call.","For the first quarter of 2015, we delivered good year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion, reflecting continued management of our cost structure and a significant reduction in our share count, while driving innovation and remaining focused on our growth strategy. We exceeded our revenue guidance range due to slightly better demand from our Cloud, Cable and European Service Providers, which points to the continued strength in the diversification of our customer base.","Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with an increase in both total and product deferred revenue and a book-to-bill greater than 1. We continue to deliver on our capital return program. In the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of shares and we are reaffirming our commitment to repurchase a total of $1 billion of shares from January through June of 2015. Additionally, in the quarter we completed a $600 million bond offering enabling us to execute on our total capital return of $4.1 billion to shareholders through 2016.","I\u2019d like to provide our perspective on the proposed merger between Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent as it relates to the Juniper business. Our partners are a key component of our go-to-market strategies. The majority of that revenue is either resold or distributed through our partners. We have a good relationship with Nokia and in 2014, they resold approximately $190 million of Juniper products and services. Our strategy is to be the worldwide leader in network innovation and to deliver products and services that really matter to our customers. Irrespective of the router market, we have direct relationships with our large end-user customers.","Moving on to the foreign currency fluctuations, the pricing environment remains competitive and we take into account currency fluctuations in our pricing strategy. As a reminder, we primarily price an invoice in U.S. dollars. And as a result, we have not seen a significant translation impact on our revenue from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On the cost side and the balance sheet, we have a hedging program in place to reduce the variability associated with currency fluctuations.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at some of various assumptions behind our outlook for Q2 and the demand environment for the second half of 2015. We expect continued momentum from our cloud and cable customers. We also expect further growth throughout the year from our international customers as they continue to build out the network. In addition to these trends, we expect an improvement in demand from our large U.S. carrier customers in the second half of the year. Based on all of these factors, we expect to see an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015. You can find the detailed outlook for Q2 in the CFO commentary available on our website.","In summary, I am pleased with our performance in Q1 and I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper\u2019s success.","And now, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions for the remainder of the hour.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi","Hi guys, I had a question and if possible a quick follow-up. I guess the question Robyn or Rami was just your conviction level and the visibility in the back half of this year in terms of the outlook particularly with U.S. service providers. I also want to just clarify Robyn your comment about second half being better than second half of \u201914. Is that on a quarterly basis i.e. would you expect 3Q \u201915 to be better than 3Q \u201914 and 4Q to be better than 4Q \u201914? And then I have a follow-up.","Rami Rahim","Okay. Let me start \u2013 sorry, Amitabh, I think we got the question first. Thanks for the question, and I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Robyn. The first question about conviction with respect to the second half, the really two elements to the guidance that we have provided or the outlook we provided. First and foremost, we remain very close to all of our service provider customers including those that are here in Northern America. So we obviously have good visibility into projects that we are working on together. We have as good visibility into the trends that are happening in the industry, similar visibility to what you see. And based on that, I would say that, yes, we are pretty confident in the improvement in spending and a demand in the second half of this year.","The second element I think to your question that\u2019s equally important is the fact that we expect to see continued diversification of our business across all of our key verticals. So Q1 was another really good quarter in terms of the traction that we saw with cloud providers and cable operators. And clearly, these are very strategic verticals where our engagement with customers are happening on an ongoing basis and we feel good about the strength and our position in the industry if you will, our competitive position relative to these verticals in the second half.","And Robyn, I\u2019ll it to you for the rest.","Robyn Denholm","Yes, Amitabh, in terms of the commentary what I said was that, we expect the second half of 2015 in aggregate of it is going to be above the first half of 2015 as well as the second half of 2014. I am not expecting a different trajectory Q3 to Q4 versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Amitabh Passi","Okay. And then if I can just squeeze a quick follow-up, hey, Rami, just on the new product announcements you had, a few of them in the last three to six months, which one, two, or three would you think would start to add to revenues as we move towards through the rest of 2015 and into 2016.","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Thanks, Amitabh. First, I feel really good about the products and the announcements that we just unveiled to the industry. These are obviously technologies that we have been working on very diligently over the last several years and Q1 was honestly very exciting for us business we finally had an opportunity to announce to everybody what it is that we\u2019ve up to.","And as you know, they really touch all of our different business areas in switching, routing and security. I have to sort of just remind everybody that, yes, these products all go through their normal certification cycles. We have to first get them out of the market. So right now we are all working around the clock to make sure that we get them into our customers\u2019 hands and ready for deployment, crossing all of the tees and diving the eyes if you will on the testing that needs to happen right now.","I expect the first products that hit the market will be the switching products and there I think the ramp will be sooner just based on the availability of that product to that market followed by the enhancements that we\u2019ve made to the PTX product line that happens in the Q3 timeframe.","Amitabh Passi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski","Hi, thank you. Just a couple of questions and a follow-up to the prior question on the new products. So Rami, based on your guidance for both Q2 and the second half, it sounds like they are not really expecting a pause or kind of an half burn effect because of these new products as customers wait for the better products to come out later in the year. Can you just comment on why that is? And then follow-up on specifically the switching part of the portfolio, we haven\u2019t yet seen you announced anything in the area of 25 or 50 gig in the datacenter or 2.5, 5 gig in campus. Can you just comment on whether those are segments that you plan to address.","Rami Rahim","Yeah. Sure Simona. Thanks for the question. First, on the overhang effect that you are talking about, we\u2019ve gone through product transitions at Juniper now a number of times. So we obviously are aware and always factor into our projections and our plan, the potential for any sort of an overhang effect. But that said, I am just going to drill one level deeper. We\u2019ve been talking to our customers about these innovations for quite a long time now. In fact, with many of our customers, we\u2019ve developed these products with direct input and guidance from them. So it\u2019s not going to be new news for them.","Secondarily in the \u2013 let\u2019s say the routing demand with the PTX. Here, our customers have actually really liked the fact that we are continuing to invest in this product line and so they know they have the peace of mind if you will that they can continue to purchase it and have the ability to upgrade in the future when their capacity require them. On the switching side, I would say the overhang effective slim to none because of the fact that this essentially addresses the gap that exist in our portfolio as opposed to something that replace of the product line that already in the market.","On the \u2013 your follow-up question, on 25 gig and some of these newer interface speed, we haven\u2019t gone out externally and talked about specific products. All I\u2019ll say for now is that actually this is an important topic for us in the company. We understand what our customers\u2019 requirements are with respect to various different inter phase speeds and we are building that into our roadmap.","Simona Jankowski","Great. Thank you, Rami. And then I just had a very quick follow-up for Robyn. Robyn, I heard in your comments on FX having not had a translational impact which makes sense. It was interesting how strong your EMEA business was. Did you not see any impact in terms of either deal size is getting smaller or competitively or in terms of pricing, just from how strong the dollar was?","Robyn Denholm","So clearly in the first quarter, we did have very good results in our EMEA business. It was actually up year-over-year. In terms of the pricing impact, it is a competitive market and we continue to take into account the currency impact on our customers budgets, if you like, as opposed to just our own product pricing. And so it is a factor that we\u2019ve dealt within the past and we will continue to deal with it. Obviously, going forward, we factored in what we believe will be the impact from currency into the guidance that I have given you for the second quarter and then also more in terms of the color for the second half of the year as well.","Simona Jankowski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Pierre Ferragu","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Rami, first of all, we\u2019re talking a lot about the consolidation in the industry, of course, you\u2019ve mentioned the Nokia\/Alcatel-Lucent merger. And so, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on the topic. First of all, how do you see that affecting you guys? Like, more consolidation in the industry, and I\u2019d say beyond of course the direct impact of Nokia being one of your distributors? And then, so, I would love to hear your thoughts about how you see the industry evolving, going forward? Do you think there could be more consolidation? Do you think you could play in that? And I\u2019m thinking about two things: could Juniper be stronger as a part of a larger entity with service provider clients? And also from a technological perspective, how do you think about you guys potentially being stronger closer to adjacent technologies like wireless and transport versus being independent and focused on IP routing? And then I have a very short follow-up for Robyn.","Rami Rahim","Okay, great. Thank you, Pierre. Okay. So, certainly, we see the industry dynamics that are panning out right now. Consolidation is one of those industry dynamics and difficult to predict, but, yes, it could continue going forward. There are other dynamics that are happening as well. There are transformational architectural shifts that are happening right now across the industry, of a movement towards cloud-based service delivery, value delivery to the end users whether that\u2019d be residential or business end uses.","And honestly I believe that there is a need for a company that\u2019s going to be really laser focused on developing the types of IP innovation that are necessary to get our customers to make this transition. That\u2019s the role that we play in this company. That\u2019s the role we play at Juniper. So the net of it is there is no change to our strategy, our strategy remains one of delivering and competing based on the merit of our technology and on achieving scale through really effective partnerships.","With respect to Nokia, Robyn addressed in her opening remarks, we have deep direct relationships with all of the customers that we work with whether they go through Nokia or not, and we have a variety of other partners to choose from as well in taking our innovation to market.","As far as the second part of your question with respect to potential M&A for Juniper, I have said in the past and I still do believe that our strategy to innovate is going to be largely organic, but with the potential to augment it with some M&A activity. Right now the focus is primarily on getting the products that we\u2019ve announced out the door, but at some point it will probably make sense for us to think about M&A to complement that and we continue to do that as part of our ongoing strategic process.","Pierre Ferragu","Thanks a lot. And, Robyn, a very, very quick follow-up on the $190 million of business you\u2019ve generated with Nokia last year. How should we think about how sticky the business is? So I understand that you have relationship with client, it\u2019s not completely fully at-risk, but there will be pressure on \u2013 potentially on these numbers. Is that something that can happen in the short-term, or is that more like a longer-term race, because you have like good contractual and like protection related to the fact that it's difficult to swap out technology in a network?","Robyn Denholm","Thanks, Pierre. I think that is a good question. I mean from our perspective, obviously, what we control is actually our relationships with our customers, our end-user customers. In terms of the profile of that $190 million for 2014, it was both product and services; it was actually routing, switching, and security, in those numbers. Clearly, there is some overlap in terms of routing with the Alcatel-Lucent portfolio as and when this transaction closes and so that will take some time. So, we believe that there is an opportunity to continue to partner on those areas where we don\u2019t overlap. And then, obviously, the services contracts continue over time with those end-user customers. And the profile of the revenue products versus services is roughly the same as the overall Juniper profile in terms of overall percentage.","Pierre Ferragu","Actually, that\u2019s very good. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ehud Gelblum","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Rami, welcome conference calls, I guess you did one before too, but \u2013","Rami Rahim","Thank you.","Ehud Gelblum","Sure. So, a couple of things. First of all, we have mergers in lots of different directions. One obviously is the vendor one, you\u2019re talking about. The other one, given that you are seeing strength in cable is coming from two large cable companies in the U.S. that were on a merger path that may or may not be on a merger path, going forward. Can you give a comment as to how would that impact things positively or negatively, if that merger doesn\u2019t go through? And what kind of like signposts should we be looking for, in terms of what that would mean to your business at EDH1 and just thought process on that? And then, Robyn, a couple years ago, when you had a slew of new products coming out in 2011, I want to say, you gave us this target, I believe it was $75 million \u2013 $75 million or $150 million, I can\u2019t remember. That was about seven quarters out. Is there some kind of signpost that you can give us on growth of these new products that you came out with that are coming out now that we can kind of look to, a couple of like a years or so out, so we can kind of track the progress of the new products? And then I have a very quick \u2013 just a small follow-up.","Robyn Denholm","So, Ehud, I will address the second part of the question and then Rami can address the first part around customer consolidation. So in terms of the new product ramps to revenue, obviously, we are very focused on doing that. And Rami went through the number of steps that we need to do in terms of getting the products out and then also having them certified for the networks and that type of thing. We have not put out nor are we going to put out a number in terms of the quantity of revenue to expect. What we would do is give you progress as we incur design wins and that type of thing. But in terms of an overall number, it\u2019s included in our outlook for the second half of the year and it will be modest this year in terms of any revenue impact.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Robyn. On the question regarding cable, first, I will remind everybody that cable is one of our key strategic vertical that we are focusing on and measuring ourselves against in terms of performance of the business. We enjoy a really strong relationship on both sides of the potential merger, you talked about Comcast and Time Warner, and we continue to do so. We\u2019re working very closely with them on the variety of different projects. I personally engage with executives on both sides.","So, honestly, whether it happens or not is a very neutral thing for us, it doesn\u2019t change the importance of the vertical for us, it doesn\u2019t change our investment level that we would put into the vertical to make sure that we remain aligned with the innovations that we are introducing into the market. And I will say that some of the new products that we have just talked about were developed with explicit and detailed feedback about the requirements for the cable industry. We know what they want, we know what kind of performance, the capabilities, the feature set that is required to build out their networks, and I feel confident that they are actually going to play out very well for the vertical.","Ehud Gelblum","Thanks. So I was just confirming that you actually are on both sides of that, Time Warner and Comcast. Robyn, my question was, on cash flow statement, there is a line, professional services related to non-routine stockholder matters. That was $7.3 million in the year ago quarter and $3 million in this quarter. Is this to deal with your activist investor? And what was the $3 million spent on?","Robyn Denholm","So that is actually to do with the settlement that we reached in first quarter in relation to our proxy.","Ehud Gelblum","Excellent. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani","Hi, guys. I have two questions. The first one is more kind of a longer term. I understand that routing will have cyclical recovery, but if I try to think outside in terms of kind of recovery, in the last four years, routing revenues were flat, 0% growth. What do you think is the outlook? What are the \u2013 even if you don\u2019t get to a specific number, what are the puts and takes for growth over the next four, five years? Why should it accelerate now, if it didn\u2019t grow the last four years, if you take the whole 2011 to 2015? The second question is about the outlook for cost cuts, if at all. So, you\u2019re coming out of the big restructuring program. Is that it from cost cuts point of view? So going forward, will margin enhancement be more of a function of revenue growth, or is there any room for additional cuts? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Okay. Let me start, Tal, and then I will pass it over to Robyn. The outlook that we had provided on our routing business over the next three years was essentially 3% to 5% in revenue growth. And I believe that\u2019s achievable because of a number of different things. First, just based on the merits of our product portfolio. The dynamics in the routing business are such that in order to grow, you need to take market share, and in order to take market share, you need to have better products.","We just introduced a router that has three times the performance of anything else that\u2019s out there in the industry today. At a time the traffic is growing substantially and our customers care about the economics of routing. We have a product that truly demonstrates to them what we\u2019re capable of doing in moving that amount of traffic cost-effectively. That\u2019s why I think we have confidence in our ability to achieve these projections.","And then, as far as the restructuring costs that you\u2019re talking about, let me just start and I will pass it over to Robyn. The most important thing that I think you need to understand is, yes, last year was a year of restructuring for us, but going forward, I think we\u2019re going to make sure that the investments we make in OpEx are going to be commensurate with the revenue growth. We are not going to get ahead of ourselves as we have done in the past quite frankly in terms of how we invest in the business. We have to see the growth that will give us the freedom, if you will, to invest in the business, not the other way around. Robyn, do you want to add anything?","Robyn Denholm","Yeah, thanks, Rami. I think, firstly, I\u2019m very pleased with the cost performance in the quarter and also the year-over-year declines that we\u2019ve actually achieved this quarter in terms of the cost. I think also just amplifying what Rami said, I mean, clearly, we put out in October that 25% is still our goal in terms of operating margin over this next three-year period. And we are focused on doing that in a balanced way. We want to make sure that we continue to invest in the future of the company, which is obviously the innovation that we are delivering to market.","And we will, as Rami said, grow OpEx outside of this year slower than we grow our revenue. And so that\u2019s how we will continue to expand operating margins just like we did in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. So that is our strategy and we are continuing to do that. So the other side of that tale is that we are always looking for cost improvements, a lot of those will be invisible because you have to actually take cost out to even keep it flat in any sort of environment. So we are very focused on the cost side, but in a very balanced way.","Tal Liani","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Sue","Thank you. It\u2019s good to see the encouraging commentary. If I look at it from a historical perspective, you went through a period of product pruning. We now know you will keep routing, security, and also switching. As you balance your commentary with OpEx, are there submarkets or perhaps verticals where you might potentially retreat from, while you fortify your efforts into the other verticals of cloud, data center, and service providers? Just trying to get a sense of how you narrow the scope so you get multiplied the effects on the other end.","Rami Rahim","Yes, thanks, Mark. You know last year was a busy year and a tough year quite frankly because we have to make some difficult decisions about which particular product areas we are going to remain in and which ones we would divest and which ones we would unwind. That work is effectively behind us at this point in time. So I feel very good right now that we are not stretching ourselves too thin, that we are investing in areas and investing sufficiently in the markets that we are playing in in order to differentiate, to compete and to win. It\u2019s that simple. So at this point, the focus really is on the focus in our strategy that we have to grow top line and we\u2019ll go from there. We are in execution mode.","Robyn Denholm","Yeah, and if I can just add as well, Mark, you know the work that [indiscernible] go-to-market side is also obviously yielding results and if you look at our strategy more deeply in terms of the vertical focus that we have, it\u2019s obviously clearly focused on those customers that differentiate the network or run their business on the network across cloud, cable, carriers, as well as strategic verticals in enterprise and government. And so we are very pleased with that. And partnering is a key element of making sure that we continue to get the growth rates from a revenue perspective and continue to drive operating margin expansion as well.","Mark Sue","That's helpful, Robyn, and on that, as you look at margin improvements and you look at firming net income, how should we think about cash flow from operations, considering the business, when it hums along, generates a lot of cash? Any thoughts on how we should think about cash flow from operations, this year?","Robyn Denholm","Yes, I think cash flow generation is a core strength of the business model that we have here at Juniper. I think that operating cash flow in particular does follow the operating margin and the expansion of that will obviously lead to more cash per revenue dollar being generated. And so we are very pleased with our cash flow for the first quarter and even for the whole of last year and that enabled us to continue to drive the investments that we need going forward and also deliver a healthy return for our shareholders in terms of the capital returns that we\u2019ve been committed to.","Mark Sue","All very helpful. Thank you, and good luck.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thanks you. The next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yeah, hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to ask either one of you on the routing cycle, maybe a little bit more short-term question. Which is, you guys seemed to think the routing cycle had bottomed last quarter, is down 15% year-over-year in your numbers. This quarter, you are down 8%, it does kind of feel like that was the right call for you, anyway. Should we anticipate the routing cycle continuing to improve? And, do you think that we're getting to positive year-over-year growth in the second half of your routing? So, that\u2019s the first question I\u2019ve got. And then I\u2019ll just ask a follow-up after you guys answer that one.","Rami Rahim","Let me start and I will see if Robyn wants to add anything. I\u2019ll just go back to the commentary we had made. We do expect just based on the two factors that we\u2019ve outlined, service providers spend in general, I mean, I\u2019m talking telco spend in general and, specifically, here in the United States, should improve in the second half of the year and then also the further diversification of our business across the different key verticals that includes cloud, that includes cable. Now based on that, we do anticipate the second half to be better than the first half and also better than the second half of last year. Robyn, anything else?","Robyn Denholm","Yes, I agree with obviously everything Ramey said there. I would also point out and I mentioned it in my CFO commentary that we actually had a good routing quarter in Q1 in enterprise as well and that just speaks to not only the diversification of the revenue, but some of the key strategic pivots that we made last year around the data center. So, obviously, in enterprise as well as in cloud data centers in the service provider world there is an element of routing that\u2019s in those solutions as well. And so we are pleased by that performance. We saw some good wins and some good revenue on the enterprise side of routing as well as the SP side. But to confirm, we do expect service provider routing to improve through the year as well.","Rod Hall","Okay. And then my follow-up I guess is a strategic question for you, Rami. As you look at the routing business, it looks like, overtime anyway, routing and optical will come closer together. We know there's some organizational reasons at carriers that\u2019s not going to happen as quickly, particularly in some of the bigger carriers, but I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re thinking about prospects of a standalone routing company? How badly do you think you guys need to develop an optical capability, a deeper optical capability, I should say, and do you think it would ever make sense to acquire assets to provide that kind of a capability?","Rami Rahim","Yes, Rod, you are absolutely right, there is a transformation that\u2019s happening right now in the industry where the packet world if you will and the optical world that are moving closer together, you are also right about the velocity at which that\u2019s happening. It\u2019s not happening very fast there are all sorts of non-technology barriers that are in the way that will prevent it from moving fast.","As far as our own strategy, we do have a small, but very effective optical team in-house to Juniper that I do expect will grow over time that has the capability of taking off-the-shelf optical components that are available to anybody really and integrated them into our routing products, but I also do believe that where most of the innovation is going to be on the packet optical convergence topic. It is going to be in software, it is going to be around the ability to look across layers and to make optimal decisions how to move information from place A to place B, leveraging optical and packet technology as efficiently and effectively as possible. And we have now a product called the NorthStar controller, which is essentially our WAN SDN controller that does exactly that.","Honestly, I think we have some of the best minds in the industry right now that have developed algorithms that have the ability to optimize these pass across layers in a way that is very meaningful to our customers and we are engaging with a number of different customers on these products. It is still early days, early stages, but I\u2019m encouraged by the progress that we are making.","Rod Hall","Great. Okay thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jess Lubert","Hi guys thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the security business and specifically I was hoping to understand if you see any developments that will you believe this business may be nearing a bottom, would you expect the security business to also strengthen through the year and potentially return to growth during the second half and perhaps you can walk through what\u2019s going well and are the keys to better participating what seems to be a fairy vibrant security market?","Rami Rahim","Yeah thanks Jeff. So, our goal for this year as I stated last quarter is around stabilizing the security business, if you take a look at our SRX business in Q1, it was more or less flat with Q4. The part of the business that\u2019s in decline and that will continue to be in decline is going to be the legacy ScreenOS business. We\u2019re still in working progress mode if you will on security. I did mention that we pivoted our strategy, we\u2019re not working on a security strategy that\u2019s very highly aligned with the rest of our product portfolio and offering to main level solutions to have a strong security element to our customers and we are executing on a very high leverage engineering strategy. So, just last week in fact we announced the industry\u2019s fastest firewall that\u2019s 2 terabits per second. For cloud operators they are trying to protect massive cloud infrastructure and for mobile operators that are trying to protect the mobile users, their mobile infrastructure that\u2019s very, very meaningful and it\u2019s only possible because of the silicon innovations that we\u2019ve already developed in-house for our other product lines and it just demonstrates the power of the synergies if you will from a cost standpoint that exist in the organization.","So, in summary we are focusing on a narrow part of the market. It\u2019s the network security space, tightly aligned with the rest of our products and we believe that we can in fact innovate to differentiate and win there. It\u2019s just going to take a bit of time.","Jess Lubert","Rami in the security business over the last couple of years, a lot of your success has been at the high end with large services providers, as services provider spending improved in the back half of the year, should we expect that to also benefit the security business and how are you thinking about security with respect to enterprise, is the recovery likely to be more carrier focused or are you also expecting similar improvement on enterprise? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Well as CapEx improves for services providers I expect that to help all of our business, I don\u2019t know whether specifically for this second half it will have an effect on security. We haven\u2019t broken that out in that way. The enhancements that we are making right now to our Juno Space security products, I want to make clear are certainly very compelling for the service provider space, but it is also compelling for large scale enterprises, so those that are building large enterprise clouds will benefit from the performance and scale that we are adding. And of course it doesn\u2019t stop there, we\u2019re also continually enhancing our virtual security products and assets, which is very meaningful for the enterprise space because at the end of the day breaches will always happen, you are always going to be able to overcome any security barrier you put as a parameter, once that happens the key is to prevent the spread of Malware inside of the enterprise and our reversal security products are now being used by enterprises to do exactly that. So, yes our strategy is very much around SP and enterprise. The scale and performance helps both. Certainly more on the SP and the cloud infrastructure space, but also in the enterprise side and finally virtualization is something that will certainly help both SP and enterprise.","Robyn Denholm","And just to underscore that I made the comment before about routing and datacenter and the enterprise. The same was true in the quarter for security. The high-end was up again, nothing to write home about yet because it was flat overall. SRX fled overall sequentially. However, the area that did grow nice was actually the datacenter space in the enterprise in this quarter. So, it\u2019s early days, but our overall aim for this year is to create stability in that business this year and then go from there.","Jess Lubert","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes thanks. Hi Rami how is it going. A question for you and Robyn. A question for you Rami is, it seems to be like you are doing quite well in the non-telco segments, you know the cloud portals Web 2.0 etcetera that will be helpful for us to get any color on the rough percentage split in terms of revenues like for routing. So, would it be less than 10% for Web 2.0 cloud maybe somewhere in the 10%, 20% and then the remainder would be telco and cable. It would be very helpful. Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Hi Vijay. Look we haven\u2019t broken that out. We can consider doing that at point. I will say that the fact that we are seeing strength in cloud and cable and government is not an accident, it\u2019s a deliberate part of our strategy. So, we are in fact listening very closely in making sure that we weave in the requirements from all the customers in these verticals into our products. And I feel good that that\u2019s going to continue. I mean I will tell you again that the products that we have just announced that will be shipped throughout this year were all developed with a deep understanding of specific requirements in these verticals that others that might not have the strategic relationship that they have with these customers would have implemented. So, I expect that that part of the business will continue to do well and certainly the telco side will do well as there is improvement in the CapEx environment there.","Robyn Denholm","Yes. I just want to add one more point Vijay. I think the diversification of the revenues, the core strengths of ours and this quarter one of the stats I will leave you with is of that top 10 customers in the quarter, 5 were carriers, 3 were outside of North America. We had four customers in the top 10 that were either cloud or cable and one enterprise customer. So, to me that is - it is really good in terms of the diversification and it is not something that happened over night. That\u2019s been work in progress by the team for quite some time. It speaks to the strength on the go-to-market side as well as the relevance of the products across multiple customer types and so we are pleased that with that progress.","Vijay Bhagavath","Excellent. So here is the question for you Robyn that Juniper obviously is engaged in many new initiatives programs, many different types of customers to work with, how would you look at OpEx as a percentage of revenue for the remainder quarters of the year, you see that trending up as you get into new project from an NFE on the service provider side. The Web 2.0 cloud have their own idiosyncrasies in terms of how they want to work with you, how should we look at OpEx? Thanks.","Robyn Denholm","Yes. So, OpEx as we\u2019ve talked about before for this year, for 2015 we have set a goal of $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million. As we move forward, we said earlier that we\u2019re committed to the 25% operating margin over the next three years. As we grow revenue, OpEx as a percentage of revenue, will start to come down. And so, we\u2019ve talked about that for quite some time. The structural actions that we took last year and the cost areas that we continue to work on are a testament to that. So we are committed to doing that in a balanced way so that we can continue to grow the business over the long term.","Vijay Bhagavath","Okay. Thanks. Good luck to you and your team.","Robyn Denholm","Thank you.","Rami Rahim","Thanks, [indiscernible].","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Sanjiv Wadhwani","Thanks. Rami, a question on the switching side. Last year in the first half, you did really well in the switching touching $200 million in revenue in the June quarter which historically has been tough to get there. I\u2019m just curious you are tracking about $20 million, $30 million below that number. What\u2019s changed between last year and this year, and what gets you back to that $200 million or north of that? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","Yes, sure. Thanks, Sanjiv. On the switching side, let me sort of try to breakout the business and then probably shed some light on some of the observations that you\u2019ve made. There is a service provider and an enterprise component to our switching business. The service provider side especially as it pertains to cloud has actually performed quite well and that includes performance in the Q1 timeframe, the quarter that we just wrapped up. The enterprise side is a bit of a mixed story which is what you are seeing right now, observing right now in the numbers. Cloud as it pertains to enterprise, so private cloud type deployment as well as enterprise IT datacenters has actually done quite well. So that area of the business just I think because of the focus and some of the newer product introduction has helped us grow in that area of the business.","On the campus side, you have to understand that we\u2019ve just sort of done a bit of a campus pivot in our switching business or in our strategy all up that includes taking some of the products that we had in-house, take our SSL VPN business, our Pulse business, the wireless LAN business and we pivoted there to a partnership approach. And I think that that strategy needs to play out over a number of quarters before we get to some sort of stability and return to growth if you will. Once that happens, I think that will create the environment if you will for all of growth in switching.","Last but not least, clearly we have been competing even in the datacenter without a complete portfolio of products which we are just about to plug if you will with the innovations in the QFX 10K product line that we have just announced and we\u2019ll start to introduce for our customers in the middle of the year. That gives me more confidence again that I think that switching can be a good growth engine for the company going forward.","Robyn Denholm","Dany, are you still there?","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go head.","Ittai Kidron","Thanks. Rami, I want to drill into that switching segment that Sanjiv started. First of all, can you give us a list of qualitative assessment of the breakdown between your datacenter and your campus wiring closet switch just from a revenue breakdown standpoint?","Rami Rahim","We don\u2019t break it down but I will say that they both represent pretty meaningful portions of the overall switching business, Ittai.","Ittai Kidron","Okay. And then regarding your, the new announcements that you\u2019ve made is very exciting the new switch, but you\u2019ve had a couple of switch cycles in the past and you\u2019ve kind of fumbled on them whether it be the QFabric and even the high end of your modular portfolio, the 9200 and the 8200. They never really managed to catch any traction. It seems like that can modular. You\u2019ve always had very difficult challenges. So what changes in the next cycle?","Rami Rahim","Well, I mean at the end of the day these are just words and it\u2019s the numbers that are going to have to prove our thesis if you will of our competitiveness in this space. But all I\u2019ll tell you is that, we have learned tremendously, tremendously from the lessons of introducing the products into the market that are in the market today whether they\u2019d on the EX side or the QFabric side and so forth.","And we have taken all of those lessons and applied them over the last couple of years as we were developing these new products into the development of those product lines. And we have now been talking to many of our customers about this product line for quite some time and so far what we\u2019ve heard from them and in fact some of the them had early access to the products and in terms of an ability to actually kick the tyres on them.","The feedback has been quite encouraging. Now we have a lot of work to do to finish up testing, ramp up production and get these products into the market. We are doing exactly that right now. But I feel really good about the prospects of this product line.","Ittai Kidron","Okay and very good. Lastly, from me, HP announced its acquisition of Aruba, that was your Wi-Fi partner since you\u2019ve exited your Wi-Fi business. Any thoughts on how you plug that hole since you\u2019re trying to plug a lot of holes.","Rami Rahim","Yes. Fortunately, I don\u2019t consider this as a hole at least not right now. Now, things could evolve in certain ways but at this point in time, I am very close to the Aruba executive team. I\u2019ve talked to their CEO. That partnership continues. The foundation of that partnership is one that is based on open interfaces between our technology and their technology. So having the ability for our customers to choose battery technology is fundamental. And anybody that lose side of that will lose just because our customers will not accept anything else. And I think that\u2019s the thing that makes this solution a) long lasting, but more importantly or just is importantly it gives our customers the ability to interchange either at Juniper or the Aruba side with different types of technologies.","Ittai Kidron","Very good. Good luck.","Rami Rahim","Thank you.","Robyn Denholm","Thanks, Ittai. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Brian White","Yeah, Rami, looking at the enterprise market, it was much stronger than seasonal on a sequential basis. In fact it was the best since the first quarter of 2010. So maybe you could walk us through some of the drivers I know Robyn mentioned enterprise routers. But what\u2019s the dynamic in enterprise that it came in so much stronger than seasonality.","Rami Rahim","Okay. Thanks, Brian. Let me start, yes, we are pleased with our enterprise performance at least from a sequential standpoint. There are a couple of dynamics here. First and foremost is from a industry vertical standpoint, the government is actually helping here. We are seeing good strength in some projects that we have with the government agencies and this helps us and switching helps us and routing it also helps us to some extent and security as well.","Beyond that, the focus that we have on this transformation that\u2019s happening towards cloud based service delivery is very important. So we are working right now with a large Fortune 500 company and building out their cloud infrastructure around the globe. And that is a testament to the strength that we have in our MetaFabric architecture and the switching product that we\u2019ve introduced into the market. It\u2019s also a beautiful example of how security ties in really effectively to complete the cloud solutions that we offer to our customers. I expect that to continue.","Brian White","Okay. And just around the product cycle, when is the bulk of the products hitting the market becoming generally available in the second quarter or third quarter? Thanks.","Rami Rahim","It starts in the second quarter but it actually goes throughout the second half of this year.","Brian White","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Robyn Denholm","Okay. Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your participation and your great questions. Before I close, I just want to give a head up for the Juniper IR and SG&A team that worked out the new format for today\u2019s call. We hope you found it helpful and we love to hear your feedback. Thanks everyone. Talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."],"12624":["Juniper Networks, Inc.

Please keep your questions to one per firm.","With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Kathleen. Good afternoon, everyone. We were off to a positive start in 2017 and delivered strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the March quarter. Total revenue was $1.221 billion at the high end of our guidance range and we saw year-over-year growth across all customer verticals. We delivered strong profitability metrics with year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share. We believe we are benefiting from our diversification strategy and I'm pleased with our overall performance.","We believe the biggest trend that is driving our industry and our strategy as a company today is the cloud. As the industry evolves, cloud architectures are no longer the exclusive domain of the cloud providers. Customers across all verticals are developing strategies for moving to cloud service delivery models and this aligns with our strategy to power the cloud transformation. I'm pleased with our year-over-year revenue growth of 25% in the Cloud vertical and would point out that our cloud solutions are addressing the cloud transformation across all of our key verticals.","In the quarter, we continued to deliver on our innovation roadmap and announced two new solutions for the data center. In January, we announced Juniper Networks Unite Cloud, a transformative data center solution that gives enterprises a simplified way to create and manage hybrid multi-cloud environments. This solution delivers a secure and agile platform and is designed to reduce the total cost of ownership while increasing long-term return on our investments for our customers. At the OFC conference in March, we introduced our data center interconnect solution, Open Cloud Interconnect. This comprehensive DCI solution brings together our strength across packet and optical domains to enable a diverse range of network operators to accelerate cloud service delivery, while simplifying network operations.","Earlier this year, we were delighted and honored to receive Vodafone Group's most prestigious award for Supplier of the Year. Juniper is a strategic provider of IP routing and security technology for Vodafone, specifically for next-generation data centers, IP\/MPLS (sic) [IP\/MLPS] (05:06) backbone and mobile backhaul domains. We believe that our continued strategy to lead in network innovation in key areas such as automation, software-defined networks, and network function virtualization will continue to enable our Telco customers to build new and innovative business models going forward.","Now, I'd like to summarize highlights across switching, routing and security. In switching, we saw continued data center strength with our QFX products family, which once again grew over 50% year-over-year and continues to increase as a percentage of our overall switching portfolio mix. We are seeing continued traction in our QFX portfolio as customers across all verticals move to 100-gig, where we have industry-leading products. Our routing business grew year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of PTX revenue growth as well as modest growth in MX. We continued to see healthy demand for our newest generation of MX line cards, which had a record shipping quarter in Q1.","Tremendous work has gone into the security product portfolio that we are very proud of. Juniper's differentiated SDSN strategy has been received very well by industry analysts and customers for its ability to detect and stop threats in a highly automated way. The innovative approach of viewing security as an open platform allows customers to leverage all existing security investments as well as their entire network infrastructure. At RSA, we announced new technology alliance partnerships with leading security providers that simplify deployment of Juniper's security solutions across several customer use cases. Our focus this year in security is on building confidence and momentum with our partners and customers. We believe we are making good progress as evidenced by new logo wins with our newest security products.","Several global trials are also underway with managed service providers using Juniper's secure cloud managed enterprise solutions. We saw year-over-year growth in Contrail, and added several new customers in Q1, including a tier 1 operator in Europe. There was a continued expansion of orders within our existing customer base as they increased their deployment footprint. We saw continued strength in our overall services business, which grew 14% year-over-year. I am particularly pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our professional services business, where we had a strategic win at a tier 1 service provider in EMEA.","To summarize, we are executing well in a competitive environment and are proud of the strength in our product and services portfolio. The cloud is a massive paradigm shift that is reshaping all industries, and I'm excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. Looking at the remainder of 2017, we expect overall demand to be seasonal and believe our customer diversification is positioning us for growth as we navigate through volatile markets. I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I also want to extend a very big thank you to our employees for their commitment and hard work, which plays a significant role in successfully executing to our strategy and creating value for all of our stakeholders.","With that said, I will turn the call over to Ken, who will review our quarterly financial results in more detail.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the March quarter reflects strong year-over-year revenue and earnings per share growth. From a revenue perspective, all verticals increased year-over-year led by Cloud, which increased 25%. We continued to see strong growth in our QFX product family, which grew over 50% year-over-year. We continued to see strength from our Services business, which grew 14% year-over-year driven by strong renewal and attach rates, as well as the recognition of previously deferred revenue from a telecom customer in Asia Pacific. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Telecom or Cable and one was a Strategic Enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States.","Non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. While non-GAAP service gross margin was strong year-over-year, non-GAAP product gross margin declined 2.2 percentage points. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to customer mix as we expand our footprint with certain strategic APAC telecom and cloud customers as well as the product mix sold into our Cloud vertical. The decrease was partially offset by improvements in our cost structure and higher revenue volume. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $509 million, below our guided range for the quarter, reflecting our ongoing disciplined operating expense management. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to head count costs related to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016 and higher variable compensation.","Non-GAAP earnings per share increased $0.09 year-over-year, primarily driven by higher revenue. We had particularly strong cash flows from operations of $545 million, up $373 million year-over-year. The increase was driven by strong collections in the quarter, partially related to invoicing that occurred late last quarter. As expected, DSO rebounded and was 49 days. The reduction was primarily due to improved invoicing linearity this quarter. We continued to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing $125 million of shares and paying $38 million in dividends during the first quarter.","Now, I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our website. We remain committed to the financial principles we outlined last quarter. As a reminder, those principles are: we expect revenue growth for 2017; we are focused on earnings expansion with long-term consistency; and finally, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure. Although elements of our markets are challenged, we expect to grow revenue this year. We are pleased with our product portfolio and expect to see continued strength from our Cloud vertical. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we anticipate gross margin levels similar to Q1 as we expect the customer and product mix dynamics to continue. Increased pricing for certain memory components could also present an additional headwind.","We intend to drive earnings expansion this year through focused execution and operating expense discipline. We also intend to drive to our long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue this year, which is earlier than previously committed. We intend to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow to our shareholders inclusive of share repurchases and dividends.","In closing, I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And now the first question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First for Ken \u2013 sorry, for Rami, the switching business was strong. I was hoping you could help us understand the pipeline of opportunities you're seeing with the QFX buying offerings and given these products only became available over the last few quarters, is it reasonable to think, the business here could further strengthen as these opportunities mature?","And then for Ken, I was hoping you could touch on the gross margin outlook. You previously talked about being comfortable with 63%. It looks like we'll be trending below that level for the year. Just wanted to understand if there's been a change in the competitive environment, what gives you confidence margins won't continue to deteriorate? And longer term, do you think we can get back to 63%, 64%?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Hi, Jess, it's Rami. Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ken. On the switching side, certainly, we're very pleased with the performance we saw in Q1. A big driver of that performance is in the data center and has a lot to do with the deliberate focused strategy that we've had on the data center, which certainly applies to the large cloud providers, but also other verticals as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Pretty much every one of our customer verticals now has a set of customers that's moving towards cloud architecture. The heart of that is the data center.","We've always been in this space. We've always had a solution, but I would say that we've never had a solution that is this strong and that has the breadth of capabilities, both from a software standpoint, but also from an entire portfolio standpoint, the spine switches with the QFX10000 as well as the top-of-racks with the 5100, 5200s, et cetera. Do I believe that there will be continued momentum? Yes, we have, in our long-term model for this company's growth, been counting on and have provided you with color on where we see our switching business to come in. And that is going to continue to be a big growth driver for the company in the year and longer term.","I will also point out that there's another element of our switching business, which is the EX product line and that is in the campus. And although the focus has been on the data center, we're really not taking our eye off the ball in the campus side. And in fact, we have this ability to leverage technologies that we have developed primarily for the data center. Think of our fabric technologies in innovative ways for the campus, and that is actually starting to help us provide some differentiation to our customers for larger campus environments. And for that reason, we actually saw some pretty good momentum in the EX business, which helped overall switching in the Q1 timeframe.","With that, Ken, you want to talk a little bit about gross margins?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure, sure. So the gross margin landscape is very dynamic, as you know, Jess, and there are many factors that impact our gross margin. Clearly, you mentioned pricing. I would say the pricing environment is always challenging. We have not seen a broad-based change in that pricing environment. Really what's impacting us in Q1 and for our outlook is really product mix and customer mix.","From a customer mix perspective, we are seeing some opportunity to grow with some strategic customers in telecom and cloud, both domestically and abroad, we're taking advantage of that opportunity. That does put some modest pressure on some of our gross margins. In addition to that from a product mix perspective, the strength that we are seeing in switching, which is ahead of our expectations, switching within the Cloud vertical in particular, does have some modest pressure on our margins as well.","Last but not least, as it relates to our outlook, we are seeing some pricing pressure on memory. There are some memory components that are under pressure, and we expect that to be a factor for the rest of the year. From a long-term perspective, we remain focused on driving margin improvements. We continue to focus on our cost structure. As the software business picks up, we expect that to be a tailwind for our margins going forward. And obviously our biggest driver is continuing to deliver product innovation to market and monetize that innovation.","The last thing I would say is while we are doing our best to maximize margin, we remain very focused on OpEx management and overall profitability. Our goal is to make sure that we have earnings expansion with long-term consistency, and that's what we're really focused on.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you. I had a follow-up on each of the questions that was just asked. So first for Rami, thank you for disclosing the Cloud vertical. I did notice that there was a sequential decrease in your routing revenues in the Cloud vertical, and routing missed expectations. So curious if that's because some of those customers are transitioning to QFX when they would have previously used routers? And do you expect your routing business overall to grow with the Cloud vertical?","And then for Ken on the gross margin question, you had cited price pressure in the last two quarters, and this quarter, that does not seem to have been a factor. So just wanted to see if that has in fact subsided. But on the flip side, when you're highlighting the cost supplier issue and DRAM prices, is that something you can quantify for us, just so we understand the incremental impact?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Hi, Simona. I will start with the follow up on routing and switching. And then I'll pass it over to Ken. So our routing businesses always depended on large deals, large customers across the Telco vertical and the Cloud vertical, and for that reason, it's always been lumpy and I think we're seeing some of that dynamic more broadly. Routing, as we all know now, as we have been talking about, we've sort of been predicting, is essentially a flattish type of overall market opportunity for Juniper and for our peers in this industry.","We think that we can compete in that environment by taking some modest market share with really competitive products. That's true for Telco, for the Enterprise, for Cloud, for Cable and all of our strategic verticals. That's what's happening really in the cloud space as well, where a lot of the growth is coming in from in the cloud providers, is in switching today. And we're clearly taking more than our fair share there. I think the question underlying the question that you're asking is, is there some sort of a transition that's happening where architectures are moving from routing to switching and so on.","The way I view it is that each of our key product sets, whether it be the MX for programmable routing, the PTX for really lean, core transport-oriented routing and the QFX for switching opportunities, they have a sweet spot. One is really targeted for the edge. One is for wide area. One is more for the data center. But even there, what happens is that the line starts to blur, and there will be some shifting, if you will, on the sort of the edges of the use cases between each of these products. But those sweet spots continue to be very important and something that our customers largely respect. There will always be some level of cannibalization, but for the most part, I think the opportunity, in aggregate, with these three technologies under our belt is a growing opportunity.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","From a pricing perspective, Simona, the pricing environment is always a challenging environment, it has been for many, many years in this space. What I mentioned is we didn't see any specific broad-based deterioration beyond what we expected. We always expect pricing pressure, and it largely came in as we expected this quarter. But what we did see though were some strategic selling insertion opportunities. I mentioned customer mix.","We are definitely getting strategic in some of the international customers in particular in the telecom and cloud space and these are customers that we are very deliberate with in regard to these deals and we do expect margin to improve over time as our footprint expands. So that does have a pricing impact, but again, it's at a very specific customer level. On the cost of memory side, it is a factor \u2013 really the three factors I've mentioned, the customer mix, the product mix and the cost of memory, all relatively weighted pretty evenly as far as our margin guidance of 62.5%, which I believe is still a pretty healthy margin guidance for the year.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi guys. I have a question on security and question on dividends. Starting with the dividends, you grow faster than Cisco. You take share in key markets. You generate very healthy cash flow. But your dividend yield is half that of Cisco and the price discount -- the stock is trading at 20% discount to Cisco because of that. What's your philosophy, what's your strategy about dividend and an increase in the dividend yield? That's the first question. The second question is about security. You have products and new dynamics, but the revenues were down 10% for the year \u2013 year-over-year, can you discuss the outlook for 2017? What are the ups and downs? What are the puts and takes in security growth? And when do you see the inflection point of turning from declines to growth? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Tal. Let me start and I'll start with the security question. And then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk a little bit about dividends and the dividend strategy. Well the first, there has been, and there continues to be a tremendous amount of work that's happening inside of Juniper to increase the competitiveness of our products overall, the solutions and security, the feature releases and the new code drops that we're making now are coming out on a very regular basis.","And the things that gives me the confidence in our ability to stabilize and then recover and then grow this part of our business is the fact that when I look at key metrics, like the performance of new products with the newer capabilities that we have introduced into the market over the last, let's say, six to nine months, there's growth there. There is in fact momentum. The feedback from our partners, our customers is positive. And there is in fact sales achievement and revenue growth that we are seeing in that part of the business.","It's just not fast enough to offset the decline in some of the older products. So eventually, I think the math starts to work in our favor. We need a little bit of patience and a lot more of the very hard work that I know that is going across the entire company right now to get this back to stability and then to growth. And I expect in the second half of the year that we can get to growth. I will just point out that the big part of the focused effort right now is on rebuilding confidence, rebuilding the channel and of course, one win at a time, including new logos that we have just gotten in the Q1 timeframe. I think we can get this back on track.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. And as we previously committed to, the 50% of free cash flow is what we're comfortable with for this year. That would be inclusive of both share repurchases and dividends. And we'll look to be opportunistic with our share buyback programs throughout the year. That said, we're always looking to optimize our capital structure, and we will reevaluate things as things change. For example, our financial performance, our cash needs, as well as our valuation will all be factors into some reevaluation of our capital return program. In addition, we've obviously paid attention to what's going on with the new administration with tax repatriation and\/or tax changes. So those could be other factors that we'll have to consider when and if they come to fruition.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Just one question will be on (25:51) this year. For the verticals you are talking about; the Cloud, the Telco and Cable, and Enterprise, can you speak about any trends we should be aware of? For example, could the cloud business start facing difficult compares and start to decelerate? Is that something we should think about at some point as we start exiting maybe 2017? And then on the Telco side, I think it was better than we thought. Can you just give us some details behind what drove that in Q1? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Hi, Kulbinder, it's Rami. So let me start. First of all, I think the most important thing here is diversification. It's not just about Cloud, it's not just about Telco. It's really about broadening and making sure that we are diversified really along three dimensions: first is in the technologies, so it's Routing, Switching, Security; second is in the Telcos and \u2013 sorry, the verticals; Telcos and Cloud and so forth; and then also it's about geo. So, for example, we're starting to see good momentum or early momentum with the cloud providers in Europe. We're starting to see also early momentum with the cloud providers in Asia Pacific.","So that diversification strategy has paid off well for us in the last couple of years and I expect it to continue to pay off well for us. Any one of these verticals is going to be lumpy. Right? I just mentioned, for example, Routing has always been somewhat lumpy as it pertains to the Cloud vertical or the Telco vertical, and I would expect that to remain the same going forward. Anything you want to add, Ken, to that? Okay. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Instinet. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. A question and a clarification. I think in the past you all have talked about 3% to 6% revenue growth as a CAGR. I'm wondering if that sort of applies to this year? And if so, what are the puts and takes to the low and high-end of that range?","And then secondly, Ken, at one point, you had sort of passed on a chance to endorse 63% as a longer-term model, but then you said you think some of the new contracts that you've won in Asia and in cloud will grow the margins over time. So I'm wondering if we can pin you down a little bit on that long-term model. Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","The gross margin?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","First, yeah, the revenue...","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","So let's talk about revenue first, and I'll talk about the numbers and then, Rami, maybe you could talk about what would put us on the high-end, low-end of that range. So at this point, based on what we see today, we are comfortable with the 3% to 6%, which is our long-term model. In fact, I would say we're comfortable with kind of the midpoint of that range for this year. So that's really the numbers we're looking at for this year.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","As far as overachievement or underachievement, clearly we're seeing a lot of strength in the cloud space as well as in the switching business. Telco and routing remains a challenging market, and we think that it will be relatively flattish for us and maybe some modest growth in that sector and those technologies.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","From a gross margin, again, I mean it's dynamic. Five-tenths of a margin point is difficult to get right every quarter. I do think that we have some lumpiness in revenue as well as margins ahead. Customer mix and product mix will be up and down. The Q1 result was very much in line with our expectations and the guidance we put out there. I do think the 63% for the year is not out of the question. However, I think it's prudent for us to plan the P&L and focus on earnings growth even with margin headwinds continuing. So that's really what we're basing a lot of our guidance on now.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","I want to just add to that. I completely agree with everything Ken just said. When you're operating in an environment where your customer mix is changing, the technology mix is changing, we're seeing a geo mix change as well, and in certain strategic initiatives like penetration to the cloud we're even ahead of where we expect it to be right now. Predicting gross margins can be somewhat tricky.","With that said, there are a number of activities across the company right now all focused on improving gross margins. And we're running the business, as Ken just mentioned, with the assumptions that current levels are going to be here for a while, just in case. So that's I think the way that you should think about how we're running the business and the dynamics of the industry that we operate in right now and our strategy as it pertains to those dynamics.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just check on cloud revenue. You guys had said I think your target was 24% of company revenue by 2019, and obviously you've blown through that, assuming it's the same basis that we're talking about. So is it the same basis, I guess? And then if it is, what sort of longer-term target do you have for a proportion of the company revenue given the trajectory?","And then along the same lines, could you talk about that cloud revenue this year? The disclosure shows it sequentially increasing every quarter last year. Is that likely to be the case again this year? Can you just kind of help us understand what you expect from the trajectory there? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes, Rod, let me start, and I'll start with the second question, and then Ken can talk a little bit about the baseline. I know because we've now just re-categorized how we're reporting our numbers, so a little bit of expectation will probably be helpful. Will there be consistent, sequential growth throughout the year in any vertical? Honestly, it's very difficult to predict that because all of our verticals, Cloud included, is going to be lumpy. The fact that we are now in both Routing and Switching in any one vertical, Security to a lesser extent, but Routing and Switching, helps to offset some of that lumpiness. But I expect that the lumpiness will exist and will remain in effect.","The good news is I still feel very good about our ability to compete in the Cloud vertical. How close we are to our customers in the Cloud vertical, our ability to understand their requirements, their architecture, and the kinds of innovation that we need to put in place to participate in the Cloud vertical, and on all those counts I feel very good.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","And as it relates to our baseline, you have the numbers right. So we disclosed 19%, moving to 24% of our revenue. That would be a growth rate of 10% to 13%. We did recast the verticals, and the Cloud vertical actually is now up a couple points. So actually the 19% turns to 21% of our business in 2015 with cloud. So the target would move up a couple points as well to 26% of our business. Growth rate targets remain the same. However, we are seeing higher pickup in the cloud than we expected, so we're clearly outpacing those growth rates at this point in the model.","Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. And I hate to follow-up on another cloud question. But as we're now focused on that vertical, and we can see the dynamics separately in your results, I'm curious if you could help us understand the concentration or the diversification rather of your customer base within that vertical and how you would characterize your visibility in that vertical relative to your traditional service provider or Enterprise vertical?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. We can talk about the cloud all day long, because it really is such an important vertical for us, and it's a very deliberate part of our strategy, so no problem at all, Aaron. First, when you think about the cloud opportunity, I want to emphasize again that it really touches every vertical that I'm talking about the cloud opportunity all up. There are certainly those that were born in the cloud, the large cloud providers. There are those that have aspiration to become cloud providers. Think of the telcos and the cable operators that are now re-architecting their networks to deliver cloud services. And then there are those enterprises that see the value in moving workloads and applications to the cloud. All of these are an element of our cloud strategy.","The way in which we approach each can vary a little bit. So, for example, our large cloud provider customers have an ability to do a lot of the software developments on their own, but then we developed really innovative technologies like Contrail, our SDN controller, to essentially help automate and secure cloud for the enterprise and for the telco and cable space. That's just to say that all of these verticals really apply.","Now if the question is specifically around, sort of, our ability to predict the performance, our performance in the cloud provider vertical itself, I think any one quarter, a quarter here and there you're going to see lumpiness, you're going to see variations in the performance just based on their appetite to spend and where they are in certain projects and certain deployments. But generally speaking, when we talk to them, when we see industry reports, when we understand their own plans, and when we see their own performance, I mean, you see how they are performing in their respective markets, we feel good about the fact that they will continue to rely on networks as a foundation of their business, and we also feel good about our ability to satisfy their networking requirements. It's a very competitive environment, but I feel very confident in our technology.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much. The majority of the Q&A has been focused on the products and the new segments, which is fair. Now that we're getting towards the end of the conference call, could you touch briefly on Security? I don't think I heard it mentioned how should we view the Security segment within Juniper and kind of the trajectory, it's been kind of a rough last year in Security division when we look about year-over-year growth. Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure, Jim. So, I did mention earlier the fact that Security right now, there's quite a lot of effort that has gone into improving our products, making them competitive, differentiating in the solutions that we offer to our customers. And I think we're seeing very good momentum specifically in the newer technologies and solutions we've introduced into the market.","I mentioned the fact that there is a concerted effort right now in terms of go-to-market, marketing, rebuilding our channels, and rebuilding confidence in our customers and our partners' mind where we have quite frankly lost some of that confidence. That's where the effort is.","The only additional thing I will say is that there are really strong synergies between Security and the rest of our portfolio. So synergies are on the cost side where we tend to leverage a lot of the software development as well as the silicon technology across Routing and Switching into Security, and increasingly we're seeing actually very solid revenue synergies.","If you think about what our SDSN, software-defined secure network, strategy is all about, it's about enabling our customers to use their network infrastructure in an intelligent way to provide a secure fabric, a very secure fabric to prevent essentially their infrastructure, their data, their workloads from being compromised. That is essentially enabling us to sell Security along with Routing and Switching in the data center or in the campus. So I mean that's the other really important element of how we're approaching Security that I think is important for you to understand.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And my follow-up, the turnaround for the sustainable revenue growth, you mentioned a lot of effort into it. When shall we see the fruit of those efforts start to bear?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So I think that we're in the process of stabilizing right now. The newer products are growing. The older products are declining. The math is not working for overall growth. This year I think is going to be a critical year for us as we get back to stability and growth probably in the latter half of the year.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much for the details. Greatly appreciated.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Hi, Rami, Ken.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Hello.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Hi, Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. I have a bigger-picture question, Rami, which is Juniper and Arista are comparable in market cap now. I mean my view is how would you benchmark productivity per employee versus your peers such as Arista who have significantly lower head count versus Juniper. And then also any thoughts on exiting underperforming areas such as Security to just improve overall fundamentals, better allocate resources to the more productive product portfolio? Thanks.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Well, Vijay, I mean I'll just say that we understand that we operate in a competitive environment. We have competitors that are larger. We have competitors that are smaller than us. The key to our success is to focus, and if you look at what we have done over the last couple of years, there has been an incredible amount of effort put into streamlining our business, pruning our product portfolio to areas where we know that we can invest to compete effectively, and I think we're demonstrating our ability to do just that.","The new products that we have now delivered into the market space, especially in the domain of the PTX routing, in our QFX switching, in the new MX line-cards that we have introduced are all essentially doing as we expected. They're growing nicely across our key verticals, and that's what you can expect more from us in the future. I think there was a second part of the question that I've now forgotten.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. The second part of the question was, any thoughts on exiting underperforming areas such as Security and then pouring the resource into product portfolios that are selling in the market?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. I appreciate that question. Of course, I have to always, as CEO of this company evaluate the performance of any one of our products, technology areas, and businesses. I would just say that as it pertains to Security, which is I think what your question is about, the focus at this period of time is on turning around this business. The data points that we're getting from our customers, our partners are all very positive at this point, and the synergies are really good. The cost synergies and our ability to leverage technology actually enabled us to achieve: A, differentiation; and very solid efficiency in how we develop the technology that's underlying Security. And then there is the revenue synergies on top of that. So that's how I'm thinking about it right now.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Maybe we could touch on the services business for a minute and talk a little bit. It sounds like renewal and attach rates have been pretty strong for last few quarters here. Understanding it was a catch-up in the quarter. But could you just talk a little bit about sustainability of the success there? Can we expect this to keep kind of outgrowing products? And then also related to that, how we should think about gross margin leverage as that business continues to grow? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for the question. So the service business continues to be a highlight for us. It's a very healthy business for us. On the revenue side, the key is what you mentioned, the attach rates, the renewal rates, and the focus there over the past several quarters is really starting to pay off as we're seeing the revenue growth consistently do well.","As you mentioned, we did benefit this quarter from approximately $15 million of revenue that came off of the balance sheet. So you have to factor that in as you start thinking about the rest of the year. But I do expect Security after you normalize \u2013 I'm sorry, services, after you normalize for that $15 million, to be up quarter-on-quarter kind of back to our sequential patterns that we normally see in this business.","From a longevity perspective, I would expect services to outpace product but not to the same degree that it has over the last several quarters. It will eventually start to normalize closer together on the growth rate perspective. Gross margin wise, numbers we've been posting lately, the 63% to 64% is really what we're focused on going forward.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Next question, please.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jayson Noland of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. Ken, just a housekeeping, book-to-bill if you haven't given it. And then a broader question on Security. Rami, if you could \u2013 press release cites some weakness in high-end SRX. If you could talk about that a little bit and then the opportunity in virtual SRX it looks like you put some marketing dollars behind that recently.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jayson. Let me start with that and then I'll pass it on to you, Ken. The high-end SRX it addresses a market opportunity that's primarily geared towards telecom providers, especially in the mobile space. And that part of the business is just going to be lumpy. It's going to have fluctuation depending on build outs for typically Tier 1 service providers. The other thing is we have not yet refreshed that part of our portfolio for some time, but we're working on a roadmap to do so that I think will eventually contribute to that business.","The virtual SRX, I mean that's a that's an example of how we think about our strategy on a couple of different time horizons. There is the here and now and how our customers are typically building out their security posture today. And then there is what we expect in the future. Clearly, as the perimeter around the enterprise disappears, as workloads and applications moves to the cloud, the security architectures evolve and virtual security offerings become far more important.","And we actually have a really differentiated virtual security solution \u2013 the virtual SRX that is in the market, that is gaining good traction, but it's still a small market opportunity for this period of time. It's an example of innovation that, we believe, will help us in the second horizon of our strategy in the sort of two, three, four, five year timeframe.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. On the book-to-bill question as our business continues to evolve, and preferred revenue (45:33) grows over time, we believe the commentary around preferred revenue (45:34) is a more meaningful demand metric. So we decided not to disclose book-to-bill any more on a quarterly basis. We will be disclosing backlog on an annual basis going forward in addition to the deferred revenue details.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks guys.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","And as we said, Jayson, that's in line with our peers in terms of that book-to-bill metric, disclosing that metric.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you. Couple of things I want to ask. One is, in the release, you talk about, I guess, some problems you had with a particular product and some COGS reversals. Could you elaborate a little bit on what happened there, and whether or not that affected any revenue, whether it caused any delays, and how you're remediating that in terms of timing?","And then the thing I was trying to understand and back to the cloud, I'm wondering if your cloud vertical has a similar mix, or how the mix compares relative to your overall in terms of percent of revenue coming from Routing, Switching and Security? How does that mix look for the cloud vertical in particular? Thank you.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Well, let me start with the second one, and Ken, you might need to help me with this one. Switching versus Routing mix in the cloud. Now we know that, like I have mentioned I think a couple of times on this call, the business is going to be lumpy. And it's going to be lumpy both in Switching and in Routing. A lot of the growth in the Q1 timeframe for example in the cloud vertical came in Switching. But in the past, there were quarters were it has actually come in more in the Routing. In terms of mix, I don't know if we provided that detail.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So historically, what we talked about is the cloud vertical mix was largely in line with the Juniper overall mix. So Routing, Switching, Security as Juniper goes, the cloud vertical is largely moving that. As we're seeing more success in Switching, we are seeing some of that mix shift towards Switching faster in that vertical than some of the other verticals.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I believe that you are referring to...","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","I'm sorry, on the cost, the cost COGS, cost of goods sold information, sorry, on the GAAP results, I think you're talking about a supplier component remediation cost that we had, and it actually started in Q4. We are working with our customers and a third-party supplier. There are certain products we have a clock signal component defect. This is kind of an industry-wide fairly well known situation. We did take a charge in Q4 and we trued up that charge this quarter. We do believe we're handling it very effectively with our customer base and managing through this situation.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And has that affected your revenue at all? Have you pushed out any sales because of that? That was what I was trying to get at?","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","No, no. It did not have an impact on revenue. It's really more about a proactive approach we're taking to make sure it doesn't have an impact on customers from a quality perspective. We have not seen any actual quality issues to date, but we want to make sure we avoid those going forward and it has not had any impact on revenue.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the clarification.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Sure.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just kind of wondering on kind of the QFX family, I know it was up 50% this quarter year-over-year. How do we think about the refresh cycle there? And how long should this kind of outsized growth last?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Mitch. It's honestly very difficult to answer the question, just because the volume of customers that we now have that are buying QFXs from us across all verticals is very large. And I don't know if you can really put any patterns to it.","The one pattern sort of out there is just the 100-gig option. Where there are large data center deployments that require 100-gig connectivity, that's where Juniper just differentiates even more. This is where the density of our products, our Routing stack, the logical scale of our QFX technology starts to really stand out. And for that reason, if you look at our Switching growth, especially as it pertains to the data center over the last few years, it has been quite good.","Now if you narrow your analysis and you look specifically on market share in the over 10-gig connectivity space, there we're taking market share even faster. And that's just again because of the fact that where there are high-performance networking problems to be solved, we tend to just stand out among our peers in the industry.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, good afternoon. I just had a quick clarification here, did you guys comment on the cloud with respect to, is it accretive to the model from a gross margin or operating margin perspective? Just kind of curious if gross margin is lower, but maybe on the operating margin side is better?","And then my actual question is, Rami, I want to get a sense here just given the greater transparency around the cloud business and the better momentum, is this why back in early March, you announced the expanded organizational focus related to R&D with Kevin and Andy? Does this really mean you need to have a little more focus in terms of servicing your legacy customers, but also your cloud customers from a technology roadmap perspective longer term?","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Let me start on the organizational piece. I don't think I would view this from the standpoint of it being specific to any one vertical. I just reached the conclusion that having a flatter organization will result in an ability to execute with more consistency, to move faster with fewer layers in the organization to address what is a very dynamic market opportunity. As it pertains to the cloud providers themselves, we have sort of understood the recipe for how to succeed there for quite a long period of time, where it really has to be an engagement model that is at the engineer-to-engineer level. We are connected with them on a first name basis down throughout the entire organization. And that's really what's required to achieve the necessary understanding of the direction of their architecture and what has enabled us to be successful.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. And from a cloud vertical margin perspective, I would just state that from a gross margin perspective the primary driver within the cloud vertical will be product mix, not the cloud vertical itself. So as it shifts more towards Switching which is what we're seeing now and what we kind of expect to see for the rest of the year that would have a detriment to the telco vertical as an example which is predominantly Routing. But it's not because of the customer itself, it's really more the product mix going into that vertical.","From an operating margin perspective, we really don't take the operating margin down to vertical. Most of our cost, most of our OpEx is really shared across all our verticals, we don't segregate it between vertical. So you would see the same \u2013 if you were to allocate it out, you would see a similar profile in the op margin as you would on the gross margin, because everything else would be relatively equally and revenue proportionate.","I would say, although it is, as the shifts to Switching, you're seeing some margin pressure there, it's very healthy margins. We're very comfortable with the cloud vertical and the mix within the cloud vertical, and in fact that we are ahead of schedule in some of our transitions into the high performance Switching into that vertical, and that's really a good thing overall.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you for taking my question. What (53:56) answer couple of longer term strategic questions. First, how do you think about \u2013 back to a question Simona asked earlier on the call about the ability to choose between Switching and Routing. How do you think about the opportunity for things like virtual routing et cetera and how does that impact your business strategy (54:17).","And then second thing is, in terms use of capital, where does your acquisition strategy stand today, or how does that fit within your use of capital. And then my last question, just on operating expenses, obviously, you continue to control those very well. How should we think about the development of OpEx going forward? Thank you very much.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Thanks James. Your voice was kind of choppy, so I hope that I got the questions all correctly. You can tell me if I didn't. First in the virtual routing, and I'll extend that to include virtual routing, virtual security. There is certainly an element of the networking industry all up that can be addressed with virtual technologies as opposed to just hardware.","Typically, these are going to be more service oriented. They're going to be at the edge of the network. It's very difficult to solve a large core opportunity or a data center spine opportunity with just software or just virtual products. And that obviously is where Juniper has excelled historically. It's where our differentiation mostly has existed in the past.","Having said that, as the world moves towards cloud architectures and our customers have the ability to deliver services using a cloud service delivery model that presents an opportunity for us to start to offer virtual versions of our products, like virtual security being an example of that.","It's typically going to be for more scale out type of applications, think of the CPE space where the physical CPE business has generally been a small revenue generator for Juniper. Now as the industry transitions to a virtual equivalent model to the CPE space, we view this in fact as a great opportunity for us to go and to participate in.","And from an M&A standpoint, no new news there other than we continue to look at M&A strategically as a way of accelerating the strategies that we have talked to you about in the past and we're executing on today. So we're not looking at this to get into adjacent markets. We want to look at this from the standpoint of really accelerating a strategy that we are operating in today. And then last, but not least, is on the operational expenditures, Ken, I'll let you close on that.","Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So we're very pleased with our Q1 OpEx results which came in below the guidance despite the annual reset of variable compensation and kind of typical seasonal patterns in fringe costs. We're very, very happy with our performance. We are targeting 39% of OpEx as a percentage of revenue for the year, which is in line with our long-term target, but actually ahead of schedule. So we're also very pleased with that OpEx discipline going forward.","We're always looking to drive efficiencies, but it's beyond efficiencies. We're also looking to make sure we align our workforce to our long-term strategy and make sure that we're able to deliver growth going forward as well. So we believe we could accomplish all of those objectives of keeping expansion in mind throughout the way.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You guys got them all. Sorry about the bad connection.","Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.","No problem. Thank you.","Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, James. And unfortunately, that is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank each of you for your participation, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."]}}
