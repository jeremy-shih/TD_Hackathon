At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Satya Kumar, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Satya Kumar","Yes, thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, we will share our outlook on the business environment, review our financial results for the September 2017 quarter, and our outlook for the December 2017 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon. It can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.","Today's presentation and Q&A include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factor disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slide in the presentation for additional information.","Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release.","This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 P.M. Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm and a brief follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","And with that, let me hand the call over to Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thank you, Satya. And thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. Lam delivered another outstanding quarter, with September shipments, revenue and gross margins above the midpoint of our guidance range; and operating margins and EPS above the high end of our guidance range. I'd like to thank our employees, our suppliers and our customers for their active support and confidence in Lam. With enhanced opportunity, we have enhanced responsibility to contribute to the success of our customers. And in that context we are inspired to achieve our full potential.","Calendar 2017 appears destined to be another terrific year of out performance for Lam, a year that materially exceeded the expectations we had communicated at the beginning of the year for levels of demand-driven customer CapEx and our business as a direct result. The midpoint of our December quarter shipment guidance today reflects growth of approximately 50% year-over-year, nearly double the consensus growth expectations for WFE in 2017 and putting us on track to gain over 2.5 percentage points of ship share of WFE in the calendar year. ","Based on our internal analytics, we continue to expect a strong industry spending environment once again in 2018 and essentially align to stated industry consensus at this time. We believe there are enduring drivers behind the sustainability of industry spending levels and our outperformance. Central to the argument on spending sustainability is the growing importance of data and the fundamental role that the road map of silicon is playing. We are entering a new innovation era. Central to the position of Lam outperformance is the increasing scope of industry relevance and competitiveness in the Lam product portfolio today. ","The generation, transmission, storage and analysis of increasing quantities of data to create artificial intelligence has the potential to transform every segment of the economy, and we believe Lam Research is positioned comprehensively to capitalize on that strength. The last decade saw the transition from a PC-centric to a mobile-centric world. We expect the next decade is defined by a transition to an AI-centric world. Mobile devices have enabled an incredible platform of almost four billion global smartphone users, which allows for the rapid delivery and scaling of new AI-enabled services on a growing array of IoT devices and systems. ","Together, these trends are resulting in semiconductor industry revenue growth rates accelerating from an average of just over 2% in the last six years to over 15% in 2017. Even more important than revenue and profit growth, a dramatic diversification in end use demand bodes well for our future. The critical role of data in this market transition is particularly positive for memory and storage semiconductor demand in the cloud and also IoT. This is strength and opportunity both for Lam.","Cloud computing is a foundation for extremely data-intensive applications, which is driving strong demand for bit growth in server DRAM and NAND of over 30% and 50%, respectively. For IoT devices, we are in early stages of adoption of exciting new technologies like 3D cameras, AR and VR, and broad automation trends. This is driving over a 40% demand bit growth in these NAND markets. Combined, these demand trends and disciplined investment by our customers are driving record revenues in the memory semiconductor segments, which is on track to grow approximately 60% to about $130 billion in 2017 at strong levels of profitability. ","We see our customers increase their spending at sustainable and rational levels to respond to these long-term trends, with memory capital intensity slightly lower in 2017 when compared to the last two years. As we have stated previously, the products and services portfolio of Lam Research is unmatched, we believe, in its broad fit to the primary technology inflections of the industry. Our focus is to further increase this position of leadership and strategic relevance through a commitment to disruptive and customer-enabling technologies.","During our presentation at the recent Flash Memory Summit, we offered perspective that lithographic strengths alone are no longer able to provide the device performance and cost improvements that are required to drive with these megatrends in end demand. Logic devices require new solutions to deal with dark silicon and Dennard scaling limitations. DRAM devices require new solutions to deal with signal-to-noise scaling issues, and NAND devices require new solutions to deal with cell-to-cell interference and reliability.","Technology inflections such as vertical scaling, multi-patterning, advanced transistor and interconnect technologies, and advanced packaging are all critical in addressing these challenges to deliver necessary device performance improvements. These inflections are fundamentally enabled by etch, deposition and clean technologies, resulting in our served markets growing significantly faster than WFE again this year. We believe this trend is sustainable.","Anticipating these and future inflections, we grew our R&D investments by nearly 60% in the last four years, reporting during the same period 140% growth in revenues. We continue to release significant capability enhancements across our portfolio, and we have the strongest commitment in our history to new concepts, technologies, products and services from R&D. These investments continue to pay off, with significantly more wins and successful defenses than not this year.","Calendar 2017 is a stronger market share performance year for Lam than calendar 2016. Although with SAM expansion, this held less than half of our outperformance story. In addition to maintaining our leadership position of vertical scaling in 3D NAND, we had several new wins during the quarter across a spectrum of DRAM, NAND and Logic devices, and across the process flow in front-end transistors, middle of line as well as advanced interconnect.","In dielectric etch, we extended our momentum in critical transistor contract applications by delivering differentiated atomic layer etching solutions that resulted in a new PTOR position at a second-leading foundry. We continue to maintain strong conductor etch positions, with increasing adoption of advanced technology and productivity options on our Kiyo conductor etch products at leading edge foundry and memory makers. In deposition, we won PTOR position for advanced cobalt interconnect at a major foundry. We had multiple wins for new applications in atomic layer deposition for both dielectric and metal film applications for non-volatile memory devices.","To further expand our value proposition, we recently acquired Coventor, a market leader in 3D modeling and simulation in our industry. The addition of Coventor supports Lam's vision that advanced process and equipment control capabilities further enhance our competitiveness, our time to market and enable us to deliver significant incremental value to our customers. Already the potential value proposition of harnessing Coventor\u2019s modeling expertise with Lam\u2019s process and physical characterization capabilities to deliver more simulation and virtual fabrication for the development of next-generation devices has been reinforced by the excitement and substance of discussions within our engineering and collaboration partner communities.","The growing strength of our systems business is further enhanced by our strong Customer Support Business Group, which continues to deliver advanced productivity and technology improvements to the installed base and actively promote new product offerings in support of MEMS automotive power management and IoT device innovation. This business, which represents approximately one quarter of our company revenues currently is on track to deliver another record year of growth at a rate significantly faster than the rate of installed base growth this year, a byproduct of an enhanced portfolio and the strategic fit of the business with our customers\u2019 needs.","Combined, these strategies have extended our differentiation and deliver consistent outperformance for Lam. We are on track to grow significantly faster than WFE and our served markets this year. Over the last four years we have grown our shipments by 25% CAGR to approximately $10 billion this year at approximately twice the growth rates of both WFE and our largest and peers and competitive combined in the equipment industry. As we look ahead to 2018 we expect to build on this momentum with over 90% of customer decisions on PTOR selection decisions already made and on the back of what already looks to be another strong year for industry CapEx spending.","In conclusion, we are encouraged by the scale and sustainability of Lam opportunity and we continue to invest in extending our differentiation and strategic relevance to our customers. We believe these dynamics position us well to continue to outperform.","With that let me turn the call that over to Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Okay great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. We posted another solid quarter delivering results above the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics and extending our positive momentum heading into the end of the calendar year. Revenue, operating income, cash from operations and earnings per share were again at record levels in the September quarter and overall the company continues to perform well against our financial and operational objectives.","Shipments for the quarter came in at $2.382 million down 6% from the record high level we delivered last quarter and just above the midpoint of our guided range. The combined memory segment made up 66% of system shipments which was down from 73% in the prior quarter. Non-volatile memory shipments represented 49% of the system shipments, which was down from 59% in the June quarter.","DRAM shipments ticked up in the quarter, coming in at 17%, compared to 14% last quarter. Our customers continued to invest in technology migrations at a rational and sustainable level to support demand growth in the mobile and server markets. DRAM pricing continues to be strong, supporting the increased investments.","System shipments into the foundry segment made up 21% of this total, down slightly from 22% in the June quarter. Foundry spend was biased towards investments to execute the 10-nanometer ramp, as well as 7-nanometer pilot projects. Logic and other shipments increased nicely in the September quarter accounting for 13% of system shipments, compared to 5% in the previous quarter. This record level of logic and other shipments is the highest percentage for us since the June 2015 quarter and is the highest in absolute dollars in the history of Lam. This increase in shipments was driven by the ramp of our application design wins at 10-nanometer, as well as broadly higher demand for applications in image sensors, as well as power management devices.","September quarter revenue came in at $2.478 billion which is up 6% from the June quarter. Gross margin for the period came in at 47.2%, which was an improvement of 70 basis points and again above the midpoint of our guidance. Our gross margin performance as always is determined by several factors, such as overall business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter","Operating expenses were essentially flat at $438 million, compared to $440 million in the June quarter. Expenses came in a bit lower than the implied guidance as we adjusted our outlook for variable compensation for the year. We continue to focus our spending toward innovative R&D programs that are enabling our customers\u2019 roadmaps. Operating expenses declined as a percentage of revenue to 17.7% which was down from 18.8% in the prior quarter.","Operating income in the September quarter was $733 million, up 13% from $650 million last quarter. Operating margin increased to 29.6%, which was up from 27.7% in the June quarter and again above the guidance range. Operating profitability was very strong in the quarter driven by higher revenue, as well as the improvement in gross margin. The tax rate for the quarter was 14%, compared to 13% last quarter. For the December quarter I'd be modeling a rate in the low to middle teens.","Based on a non-GAAP share count of approximately 181 million shares, earnings per share for the September quarter came in at $3.46, which was above the guided range. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes. The net dilute of impact from the notes is approximately 17 million shares on a non-GAAP basis.","As we noted during last quarter's earnings call, with the increase in our stock price we've received requests for early conversions of our 2018 and 2041 convertible notes. Conversions that settled in the September quarter totaled $302 million of which $209 million related to the 2018convertible bond and $93 million to the 2041 bond. Dilution schedules included updated notional amounts for the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with remodeling.","We continue to execute on the capital return program we announced in November last year spending approximately $230 million during the quarter in share repurchases, as well as dividends and over $1 billion in the first three quarters of the calendar year. As of the end of the September quarter we had completed approximately 88% of our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization buying back a cumulative total of 6.3 million shares at an average share price of $139.17. We paid out $0.45 per share in dividends or $73 million during the quarter.","We now move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash in short-term investments, including restricted cash of approximately $6.4 billion. This was up from $6.3 billion in the June quarter. Cash from operations was strong at $858 million, up from $729 million we generated in the June quarter. Cash generation in the quarter was at a record level enabling us to grow cash while funding the convertible note redemptions, as well as our capital return programs.","DSO came in at 56 days down from 65 days in June. Inventory turns came in at four, compared to 4.1 of the prior quarter.","Deferred revenues were $938 million. This number excludes $344 million in shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters.","Company non-cash expenses including $42 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization, and $40 million for depreciation. We incurred $60 million for capital expenditures in the quarter. We exited the quarter with 9,800 regular full time employees. Headcount additions came primarily in the field and factory with further additions in the technology areas.","Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect record shipments of $2.600 billion plus or minus $100 million. I just mentioned that 30% of the system shipments in December are to new greenfield fabs. We expect record revenue of $2.550 billion again plus or minus $100 million. We expect gross margin of 47.50% plus or minus one percentage point. We're forecasting operating margins of 30% plus or minus one percentage point. ","And finally, we\u2019re forecasting earnings per share of $3.65 plus or minus $0.12 based on a share count of approximately 182 million shares.","So in summary, we\u2019re very pleased with our performance delivering another quarter of solid operational execution and we\u2019re on track for record financial results for calendar year 2017.","Things could always change. As we look into 2018, we continue to see what appears to be a strong year. Our current bias is that shipments in the first half of 2018 will be stronger than the second half of 2017. Shipment momentum heading into the March quarter seems meaningfully stronger to us than it is in December.","Before transitioning to the Q&A part of the call, I wanted to share some information about the timing of our Investor Day. We\u2019re now planning to host this event in the March quarter timeframe on an ongoing basis. This timing aligns well for us with executive availability, with the timing of our planning cycle, and with what we think will be a good investor attendance. We\u2019re excited about the sustainable outperformance opportunity we have ahead of us and we look forward to sharing with you a comprehensive update on the company\u2019s plans and objectives at that time.","Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Farhan Ahmad ","Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question is on operating margin. You\u2019re guiding to December quarter to 30%, which is meaningfully higher than the long term target model that you\u2019ve shared last time, which was at 28%. Can you just give us a sense of what\u2019s a sustainable level of margins for the business and assuming that the business can grow from here. Do you \u2013 should be thing that there\u2019s upward bias to the operating margin?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, Farhan I mean, I\u2019ll give you new \u2013 formally give you a new model when we get to the Analyst Day. I mean the way we\u2019d would be thinking about it, when I look at gross margin right now, it\u2019s probably not going to get much higher than it is right now. In fact, there\u2019s really a bias to be a little bit lower than it is. And then it all comes down to what do you think the revenue levels of the company are. We clearly have delivered in the last several years leverage to spending. And as business volumes increase we would continue to deliver that leverage, I\u2019m not going to quantify it for you, but that would be the way I think about it and then stay tuned, we\u2019ll give you a formal update when we get to be Analyst Day. ","Doug Bettinger","And just, I mean just to supplements, which is maybe some color relative to our thinking and that kind of guides how we run the company. I mean we run the company with a focus on absolute dollars of profitability and our aspiration is to increase the value of our company and outperform relative to increasing the value of our company. And so the profitability that we care about most is a dollar, not a percentage. And the execution of our business on a day-to-day basis requires a very careful balance and certainly the guidance that I provide to the company is intended to claim our fair share of opportunity, our fair share of profitability without compromising the success of our customers, because without the success of our customers our industry is going to struggle. So it is as much a choice as anything else, and the choice is defined by how we optimize performance, and we optimize performance according to dollars of profits and dollars of profit growth.","Farhan Ahmad ","Thank you. And a quick follow-up in terms of the segment outlook for DRAM, NAND for the December quarter in first half of next year, do you \u2013 how you\u2019re looking at the segment just qualitative guidance and with segment so stroger or weaker? ","Martin Anstice","Yes, so I would say, I mean Doug already provided a little bit of color relative to the first half of next year just to remind everybody he said, we bias first half of 2018 shipments stronger than the second half of 2017. And he said, shipments momentum meaningfully stronger in March over December as best we see it today. ","What I\u2019ll add is, at a WFE level our expectation is probably in the mid-to-high single digit range year-over-year, hence we would expect more than 85% of the growth in the WFE year-over-year to come from memory.","Farhan Ahmad ","Got it. Thank you. ","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Farhan.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from C. J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C. J. Muse","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question Martin, longer term question on the memory side. Hyperscale guys are asking for longer term supply agreements from chip makers, which is clearly a strategic change and speaks to how much more important memory is and how much more strategic it\u2019s becoming. And so my question to you is, is that changing your relationship at all, your visibility, how you partner with chip makers given this kind of change?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, the simple answer to that question is, yes. I do think we have more visibility. We are clearly more relevant to the success of our customers today by virtue of the scope of the portfolio and the relevance of the portfolio to the technology inflections that are \u2013 that we\u2019ve been talking about for some years. We still have to work very hard to do what we do, but I would say relatively speaking visibility and our engagments is stronger consistent with the strengthening of strategic relevance of Lam to the industry.","C. J. Muse","Okay. And I guess as a follow-up. Doug you talked about OpEx coming a little lighter in the September quarter related to I guess bonus plans. And so curious does that suggest perhaps a delay in terms of timing of clean room coming online or other factors like that have pushed shipments into the first half of calendar 2018?","Doug Bettinger","No, not really C.J. I mean the two are somewhat independent. You always \u2013 I mean, when you get to the second half of the year you start truing things up and your perspective could be a little bit different, and it\u2019s more got to do with what\u2019s going on internally than clean room coming online. There\u2019s a lot of clean room space coming online as we speak, and I think for the most part it\u2019s consistent with what we expected to see, what the industry is communicated its doing. There really isn\u2019t any difference there. ","Martin Anstice ","And just to add, I would say it\u2019s almost completely independent, because bonus plans accrue on revenues and profits on revenues not on shipments.","C. J. Muse","Great. Very Helpful. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks C.J.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar ","Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. One is Martin or Doug, if I look at your revenue as a percentage of WFE is it running it on 22%, 23%. This one I\u2019m curious like you know to get to like a 24 or higher percentage what needs to happen, is it just the SAM expansion or do you think share gains are going to be more critical to get to a higher percentage of WFE and I have follow-up?","Martin Anstice","I think they\u2019re both relevant. We\u2019ve articulated for a number of years, the opportunity for SAM expansion beyond the boundaries that we\u2019re currently reporting. So the technology inflections are far from done and they\u2019re relevant for many, many years yet to come. And as you also know from prior disclosure and their reported financial results they have the market share momentum in the company is targeted to be positive and is positive. This is a stronger market share year for the company than it was true last year and that\u2019s sits in the context of the long term models, which you\u2019re pretty familiar with. So whether it\u2019s 50-50 conversation or biased slightly to the SAM expansion conversation there\u2019s certainly some exciting business opportunity and upside for the company in the years to come. ","Doug Bettinger","Krish, this is Doug. What I get excited about is just looking out to growth in the installed base and what\u2019s going on with our installed base business, which as you know isn\u2019t part of the WFE necessarily, it just grows along with the installed base, which is as Martin said in his prescriptive remarks is doing really, really nicely this year.","Krish Sankar ","Got it, got it. Thanks. That kind of leads into my second question of the follow-up which is, so can you talk a little bit about your services business, how much is it as a percentage of revenue and what are the margin structure there like and what do you think the CAGR for that is going to be? Thank you. ","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I mean Krish, what we\u2019re talking about is, we\u2019ve got objectives to grow up faster than the installed base and it absolutely use doing that over the last several years, I got really excited about what\u2019s going on there. Profitability isn\u2019t all that different than the rest of the company.","When we look at it an aggregate the gross margins maybe a little bit less than selling new equipment, but the level of investment isn\u2019t anywhere near what we need to invest in the new equipment side. So the operating income in the cash generation is very attractive in this part of the business.","Krish Sankar ","Thank you Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Krish","Operator","Okay. Our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. Wonder if you could talk a little bit about the NAND market in the next few quarters, how do you see the spending shifting between sort of conversion of planar NAND 3D. How much do you think now is shifting over towards 3D scaling, and what happens to your I assume your share of the market potentially goes up as you move to more of a 3D scaling environment? Just some color on that would be good. Thank you. ","Doug Bettinger","Yeah, I mean the construct of this year\u2019s spending by the customer in the NAND space is reasonably evenly balanced across the kind of three implementation scenarios, right. So you\u2019ve got kind of the addition of a new 3D NAND capacity you\u2019ve got a conversion from 2D to 3D and then you\u2019ve got this kind of vertical scaling of some 3D capacity from let\u2019s say generation 2 to generation 3. And they\u2019re all representatvie. The smaller of the three is the 3D NAND scaling segments. ","As you\u2019ve heard us characterize a couple times now, we\u2019re actually almost agnostic to the part of the customer between the addition of new capacity and the conversion from 2D to 3D it\u2019s more or less the same size opportunity for the company, and I think that\u2019s unique in the industry as the byproduct of the process flow and the position of the company\u2019s products to support that inflection. ","As the 3D capacity becomes a bigger proportion and still even by the end of this year, I think it may only be about half of the installed base capacity and that half is in various forms, not all of it is latest generation, highest layer accounts kind of 3D. The the opportunity for 3D NAND is vertical scaling investments is going to grow overtime and that\u2019s the most efficient pass for our customers, it\u2019s also the pass, which is most biased to action deposition. ","So the segment concentration of a vertical scaling is even stronger for us as a relative opportunity to the rest of the industry. So at the end of the day the customers will make the right choices, they\u2019ll optimize fabs and optimize economics and that\u2019s a pretty dynamic space. So it\u2019s one that\u2019s pretty difficult to predict and we actually don\u2019t need to for the reasons what I\u2019ve just summarized.","Joe Moore","Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Joe.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Well, good afternoon and congratulations on another well executed quarter. My question is kind of similar to the last one it except it\u2019s more DRAM and the industry and DRAM has done extremely well, tight supply, very strong demand environment, all eyes are starting to turn to next year when the capital spending trajectory in DRAM is going higher. ","And the question from investors again is, are the DRAM competitors going to remain disciplined on a capacity expansion perspective, and do you guys have talked previously about 2017 maybe kind of 1% to 3% increased in total DRAM industry capacity pretty disciplined. So as you guys looking to your forward pipeline talk with your customers, how do you view total DRAM capacity expansion next year, are you guys continuing to see sort of focus on profitability?","Martin Anstice ","Yeah, I would say intensely. So it\u2019s a consolidated industry and everybody fights for their share of economics, and I think the evidence of the last several years is reinforcing of everything it was embedded in your question. To that\u2019s variablity to model, the capacity for DRAM at the end of 2017 is similar to the capacity at the end of 2015 and that\u2019s kind of wafer start out statements, and that\u2019s a statement of slight growth after the contraction year in calendar 2016. But maybe a little bit different today than was through three months ago is the proportion of the installed base that is converting to the 20-nanometer technology node is actually progressing a little bit faster than the assumptions we had three months ago. So if you look at the constructive DRAM capacity at the end of this year between 1x capacity 20 series product and then more than 20-nanometer we would guess probably 25%, 55% and 20%.","It\u2019s for sure incredibly disciplined and the balance of conversion is obviously very high. So it\u2019s a very efficient investment for our customers and to the extent that any capacity gets added it will get added as best we can tell from legitimate demand drivers and you know we have the same bit growth assumptions as everybody else in the kind of low 20% range for DRAM. And it will come from the relative transitions and density per wafer out, and as I think everybody appreciates that the density per wafer out improvements at the latter stages of the DRAM roadmap are little less than was true, let\u2019s say five years ago in a transition. ","So that\u2019s part of the story as well. But I mean as a basic premise, we absolutely expect descipline to continue and we can\u2019t guarantee that we don\u2019t have the crystal ball, but that\u2019s the planning assumption and that\u2019s the behavior especially we can help from our customers.","Harlan Sur","Thanks for the insights there. And you guys are almost completed with the $1 billion share repurchase program. I guess you\u2019d be done with that by year end, free cash flow generation sitting in kind of in the high 20% range. So there\u2019s a team late for potential tax reform or can you take on some debt to fund sort of the next tranche of your repurchase activity. And then just roughly what is the additional debt capacity that the team can take on while maintaining their investment grade status? ","Doug Bettinger","Yeah Harlan, I\u2019m not ready to give you a definitive update on that right now. Obviously we\u2019re paying close attention to what\u2019s going on relative to tax discussion in Washington. Your guess is as good as mine in terms of what might happen as well as the timing. We certainly have an ability to take on more debt should we choose to do that and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll be talking to the Board, Martin and I\u2019ll be talking to the Board about, when I\u2019ve got some update channel I\u2019ll share it with you, but I don\u2019t have that right now. ","Harlan Sur","Great, thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Harlan.","Operator","Our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Yeah, great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. The uptick you saw in Logic shipments in the quarter, it was a nice surprise. Doug, you talked about the ramp of 10-nanometer, I think image sensors, and if I call you correctly power management. I guess the question is, is this level of shipments on a quarterly basis, the new normal given that 10-nanometer is ramping or was this quarter kind of a one-off in terms of shipments?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, things will always ebb and flow as you know, I mean we\u2019ve been talking about the applications when is that 10-nanometer for a while now obviously as that ramps into production that will continue. Image sensor is kind of it comes in, it goes and likewise for the power management stuff. But I expect the trajectory to continue here, we\u2019re doing real well. And we\u2019ve been waiting for this for a while and the ramp is beginning to happen. ","Doug Bettinger","Yeah, two things to add. One of them is it is more of the new norm than not. And I hope it really isn\u2019t so surprise. We\u2019ve been talking about it for long enough, so it\u2019s really nice to actually finally answer the question for everybody and demonstrates the success of our engagements in Logic and foundry in etch and deposition both it\u2019s taken a lot of hard work from a lot of people and it\u2019s really nice to see a further increase in the balanced engagements of the company in the industry. We\u2019re fortunate to be in a very strong position around technology inflections. We\u2019re fortunate to have the strength for the company in memory at a time when memory is clearly an increasingly relevant and critical part of the roadmap of success for all of our customers and this is icing on the cake at some level. So the really nice result.","Toshiya Hari","Okay, great. And then I had a follow-up on the Coventor acquisition in the quarter. Martin you went through the acquisition in your prepared remarks. But if you can kind of reiterate what the rationale was, what you gain from this from a technology perspective, and how it could potentially impact your incumbent businesses that would be great? Thank you. ","Martin Anstice","Yeah, thank you for the question. In many respects, it\u2019s a repeat of much of the rationale we\u2019ve talked about in the context of prior M&A focus for a process control in the company and in some respects this is consistent with the messaging on data and AI having the potential to change the world and that includes being relevant to how industry and the industry of our customers as well. So we believe that we have value to deliver to our customers and value deliver to our shareholders through an enhancement of process controlled capabilities. ","And we are generally collaborative in execution today as strategies, but we have an opportunity to acquire and fully harness the capability of Coventor in the mix, it brings expertise and competency into the company that\u2019s for sure supplements and strengthens our pre-existing computer science algorithm analytics, capability, modeling capability and it\u2019s a really nice partnership I would say for a virtual modeling business hence a true process and a hardware characterization business. So the combination of those two things, we believe has an opportunity to grow faster then was true for a standalone business, the pre-existing products and services, the Coventor business, and it has an opportunity to provide us vehicles to introduce new products and services in that space. ","And last but not least, it\u2019s an opportunity to increase the competitive differentiation of the etch and the deposition in the clean portfolio through enhanced control and faster cycle time in development and better predictability and opening up process windows and so on and so forth. So it\u2019s part of what we\u2019ve been talking about for some time, it was a nice opportunity to take custody over a valuable asset and we\u2019re super excited about the opportunity in front of us, and I think that optimism is shared by our customers.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you. ","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Toshiya. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel.","Brian Chin","Hi this is Brian Chin, calling in for Patrick. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Looking at your shipment distribution for the September quarter, China is only your fourth largest geography, but shipments were down sequentially by decent amount in September. Just curious what was attributed to and whether you can comment on how the pipeline or trajectory in China looks moving through next year?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I\u2019d say that what happened in the quarter relative to China is completely unrepresentative of any broader trend. So certainly don\u2019t read anything into that other than the same for any customer, any region. Investment is a byproduct of discrete projects in any one quarter and that\u2019s all is going to happen ebb and flow. ","If we look at kind of new fab projects maybe I kind of give you an updates from the disclosure of prior periods. From now through the end of calendar 2018, we\u2019re tracking I think 2018 fab, greenfield fabs today, and the greenfield fab can be a second floor on a double stacked fab just to be fully disclosed on that. 12 of the 18 are in China and about eight of them I think are classified as domestic China and four of them are kind of Global China. ","And when you look at the distribution of investment that we\u2019re expecting next year between global and domestic players in China it\u2019s actually close to 50-50. So equipment purchases, wafer starts, capacity additions in China, domestic community and global community looks 50-50-ish at this point in time. That could change, but that\u2019s the headline today. ","So we\u2019d still say the same thing today that we said before, China for global companies and domestic community is a relevant part of our future. We believe that execution is as disciplined in execution in China as it is anywhere else in the world, and I hope that continues and we\u2019re we\u2019re very focused. We\u2019re investing heavily and our position in memory and Logic both in China is very strong. So hopefully that is helpful to you.","Brian Chin","Thanks, very helpful. And just one quick follow-up question on your comments about shipping being very healthy to March quarter. Just wondering a very discernible shift you\u2019re seeing in spending within memory between NAND and DRAM over that horizon?","Martin Anstice","Too early for us to comment at this point. I think both segments of disciplines, both segments have overlapping demand drivers, but they have unique demand drivers and we\u2019re kind of hold off until January to get specific. What I should say by the way are you going back to the China question is, when I gave my reference to eight domestic I was referring to memory and logic both and both segments are represented in the plans of our customers. ","Brian Chin","Okay, great. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger ","Thanks Brian.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.","Sidney Ho","Well, thanks for taking my question. A couple months ago you guys suggest that the WFE opportunities for NAND would be in the $70 billion over the next five years, and that\u2019s assuming 40% net growth. Now that one of the suppliers actually suggested that market will go 50% next year and it seems like you agree with that, does that make your forecast too conservative now? And if it does become 50% per year going forward and is at a 40%, how do you think about the NAND WFE? How will that change?","Doug Bettinger ","This was announcement, positive and negative table. This will be \u2013 we have no basis to update $70 billion reference at this time, same message today as was through the flash memory summit.","Sidney Ho","Okay. Maybe switching over to DRAM, is a follow-up to earlier question. There is a quite a bit of increase in DRAM CapEx by your customers, and it seems like is the consensus here is that maybe CapEx per wafer is going high obviously cost, but it is still going down. If it is getting more expensive per wafer, how do you think customers justified the high cost? And are they either gearing into cost grand they are making a lot of money these days or do you think that\u2019s being passed alone to the end users? ","Doug Bettinger ","I think you might have answered your own question. They\u2019re making more money than they ever have done. They\u2019re making more money than I do. So I would say, is a basic headline it looks like they\u2019ve rationalized an ability to make an investment and get paid for it and I think going back to the questions of discipline, consolidated industry in a disciplined capacity addition is kind of part of that story. I think your question is very good, because it is appropriate that everybody recognizes that the cost of density is higher and that\u2019s one of the reasons why the next generation memory conversation shows up in the industry today when it didn\u2019t do several years ago. ","But what I want to remind everybody is there is tons of life left in the DRAM device. There are multiple technology nodes ahead of us in the roadmap of our customers today and there are many years of investment still left in that product and technology. And I\u2019m sure a year from now we\u2019ll see something even better than that because the industry has a tendency to innovate its way to some pretty outstanding solutions.","Sidney Ho","All right. Thank you. ","Doug Bettinger ","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Weston Twigg","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on one earlier about the record shipments in ID analogic. I\u2019m just wondering when you mentioned your growth in 2018, I think you mentioned 85% of the growth looks like it\u2019s coming from memory. Why not a little bit more of growth coming from the logic and or maybe the foundry side given the 10-nanometer and 20-nanometer ramps? ","Martin Anstice ","Okay, I\u2019m glad you ask that, because I maybe wasn\u2019t quite as clear as I should have been. When I referenced 85%, I was trying to describe our outlook for calendar 2018 WFE compared to calander 2017 WFE. So our expectation is calander the 2018 is higher than 2018, I introduced a mid-to-high single digits reference for that and I provided a perspective to said we expect 85% of the growth in WFE year-over-year to be memory based. Appologise for the confusion.","Weston Twigg","I think, I understood it properly. I\u2019m just wondering with say your 10-nanometer ramp one of the big logic customers in the 7-nanometer activity at the foundries way, you wouldn\u2019t see more of the growth coming from those segments, and I don\u2019t know if your particular exposure to memory is just higher or if it\u2019s a broader reference? ","Martin Anstice ","Well, we do the best we can to take every piece of data that\u2019s available to us in terms of demand, device demand the implications of that device demand on various kind of manufacturing segments to the best of our abilities.","We look at kind of reuse capabilities, which is relevant for every segment of the industry. We take into account public and private diclosure of a company\u2019s \u2013 of our customers and we tell you to the best of our abilities what we think our outlook is. So the 85% headline is the best communication we can give you at this point.","Weston Twigg","Okay. And then as my follow-up. Just on the guidance you\u2019ve had several quarters of beats and raises and I know the market is very strong. Are you guiding too conservatively, do you think that that \u2013 I guess what are you missing when you\u2019re guiding over the last few quarters was demand running your expectations a little bit?","Martin Anstice","It\u2019s not running it by an enormous amount, Weston, I mean we\u2019ve done a little better the last couple of quarters in terms of gross margin, and I just guided you to the highest gross margin, I think in the last decade of the company. So it\u2019s not conservative by nature. We\u2019ve done a little better over the last several quarters for sure, but I just tell you \u2013 we tell you what we see as we look into the quarter. ","Doug Bettinger ","And maybe again just a supplements, it\u2019s actually not easy to give guidance, just to be clear, I mean this is a consolidated industry, and the investments of our customers are big. Any one application is big, anyone investment is big. And so the potential to predict this at the quarterly level can actually be quite challenging. And I would say our guidance is really good because consistently we are guiding and performing within the range of our guidance. So with due respect to your question, maybe we're not as precise as you'd like us to be, but I feel really good about the integrity of the guidance conversation and then performance of the company inside of the guidance range consistently.","Weston Twigg","All right thank you, very helpful.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Wes.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Edwin Mok","Hey guys thanks for taking my question. So I guess just a quick follow-up to Wes\u2019 question, I think the general consensus is that China's spending will grow in 2018. [Indiscernible]?","Martin Anstice","We've lost you, Edwin.","Edwin Mok","That is the contribution from China.","Doug Bettinger","Edwin ask your question again, sorry you broke up midway through there.","Edwin Mok","Sorry about that. I'm trying to understand how much China is contributing to your growth on 2018 within your expectation of mid-to-high single digit growth.","Doug Bettinger","Too early for us to disclose at this point. We'll give you better color on next year. I mean, it's a little bit early. Normally at this juncture we wouldn\u2019t be talking about 2018. We\u2019ll give you the normal color when we get to next quarter's earnings.","Edwin Mok","Okay. All right. I think that's fine. So I guess, the question I have on EUV, there's a lot of talks about EUV adopting 7-nanometer. And I remember you guys have talked about doing some about etch and deposition. [Indiscernible] to help with challenges like line etch softness [ph]. Is it possible you can give us some update around that, where do you stand that? And do you think, that can potentially be a SAM [indiscernible] as EUVs are adopted?","Doug Bettinger","I would say the basic message \u2013 and I apologize again, we lost you mid-sentence, but the basic message of the company today around our opportunity in the context of an EUV implementation is almost identical to the scenarios we characterized in the investor and analyst meeting about a year ago. So the insertion plans of our customers appear to be consistent, and the balance of space-based patterning implementations in the industry appears reasonably consistent with the assumptions we made before.","So I don't think we can give you anything better than we already did. I apologize.","Edwin Mok","Okay, thanks. Sorry about my line.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, no problem Edwin. Thank.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take out next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead. ","Craig Ellis","Yes thanks for taking the question. And congratulations on the very fine execution guys, as well as numerous financial records. I just wanted to follow-up with some of the China commentary with a clarification question. I think you mentioned of the 2018 Greenfield patch you're tracking, 12 are in China, and there's a split between domestic and global, but even looking at the number of domestic fabs, the company has cited that, that could mean that either that exposures with some of the smaller fabs that are trailing-edge Logic or there may be with some of the larger fabs.","Can you clarify if you're participating with that number that you provided in some of the larger China fabs next year? Do you see those coming on thereafter?","Martin Anstice","Yes is the answer to your question. It includes the reference of eight includes the bigger domestic guys and the smaller domestic guys. Its memory and Logic both. It's DRAM and flash. The flash investment is obviously materially greater than the DRAM investment in the context of market opportunity, primarily. But we are seeing the emergence, as we've talked about for some time, of investments by domestic customers in calendar 2018, big and small; memory and logic. And it's still a fairly gradual implementation, so there's no pendulum swing, there's no paradigm shift, but there's a commencement of pilot-line investments and then transition out of pilot-line into first phase, high-volume manufacturing.","But the discipline that we all hope we are seeing to the best of our abilities today.","Doug Bettinger","And Craig, when we think about WFE and pilot investments that Martin was referencing, I mean, it's \u2013 for the local guys, it's an incremental $1 billion or $2 billion in terms of total WFE. A lot of the activity continues to be as it is this year. The global multinationals doing projects in China.","Craig Ellis","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful, guys. The follow-up is just regarding the comments for first half 2018 shipments to be up meaningfully versus the second half of 2017. And acknowledging, Martin, your point that the business is a hard-to-forecast business. I'm just wondering if there's any color that you can give us on linearity as we think about the first half of 2018 for the business. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yes let me just clarify Craig. What we said is first half 2018, higher than second half 2017. The meaningfully comment was relative to the March quarter, not necessarily the entire half. And it's really too soon for us to call linearity into next year. Again, that's something we typically would do at the end of the December quarter, and you can expect to hear from us then.","Craig Ellis","Thanks guys.","Doug Bettinger","Yes.","Martin Anstice","Thank you very much.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Craig.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Tom Diffely","Yes another question on the DRAM side of the market. You talked about how wafer starts are roughly flat from 2015. Do you expect them to go up over the next couple of years or mainly just going down to the sub 2 \u2013 the 20-nanometer node?","Martin Anstice","The planning assumption we have today is up a little, but it really is a little. And it will only go up a little if there's legitimate demand for devices that require that investment. So there really is no headline in terms of capacity expansion in DRAM unless there's a dramatic change to the demand statement for the segment. So it might go up and down a little bit, but it's basically headline of technology conversion. And the technology conversions, to the point I made before, are less effective gradually in terms of delivering density per wafer out than was true five years ago. But they're still incrementally valuable, and our customers appear to be making lots of money manufacturing and selling those devices.","Tom Diffely","Okay. So when you look at the 80% to 85% of the growth from memory next year, is that mainly NAND then?","Martin Anstice","No, it's not, but I'm not going to give you specifics at this point in time. I felt like I was super extravagant with my 85% memory disclosure, so apparently, you have a never-ending appetite for more.","Tom Diffely","We always want more.","Martin Anstice","Unfortunately, I don't have a never-ending appetite to provide more, so if you\u2019ll just wait on that question until we get a little further into next year, we'd appreciate it.","Tom Diffely","Alright, thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Tom.","Doug Bettinger","Thank you.","Operator","And it does conclude out question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Satya for any additional or closing remarks.","Satya Kumar","Yes thank you once again for joining us. And have a wonderful rest of the day.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks guys.","Operator","And once again that does conclude today\u2019s presentation. We thank you all for your participation. And you may now disconnect."],"13019":["Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 31, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Tina Correia - Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations","Tim Archer - President & Chief Executive Officer","Doug Bettinger - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Timothy Arcuri - UBS","C.J.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.","Tina Correia","Great. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the June 2019 quarter and our outlook for the September 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.","Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 P.M. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","With that, let me hand the call over to Tim.","Tim Archer","Thanks, Tina, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. In the June quarter, Lam delivered strong results. Revenues, gross margin and operating margin exceeded the midpoint of the guidance we've provided on our last earnings call, while EPS exceeded the high end of the guidance. Our ability to deliver these results was made possible by the support of our customers, our employees and our partners and I would like to thank them for their ongoing commitment to Lam's success.","I would like to start by offering some perspective on Lam given the uncertainties surrounding trade and other influences on the market environment. Through the first half of calendar 2019, we have executed at a high level by focusing on what is in our control. And despite a difficult memory market, we have delivered on or exceeded our commitments.","As you will hear from Doug later, we generated another $880 million in cash from operations in the most recent quarter. At the same time, we have continued to prioritize investment in innovation and product differentiation, shifting a higher percentage of our total OpEx to R&D than in any prior quarter in our history. We remain committed to our long-term growth vectors observed available market expansion, market share gains and increased revenue from our installed base.","Specific proof points are emerging that validate our progress in each of these areas and I will touch on them later in my remarks. But first let me update our industry outlook.","Our view on total WFE remains directionally unchanged, with calendar year 2019 down mid- to high-teens percent from 2018. However, since our last earnings call, Memory spending is incrementally lower, while Foundry spending is tracking higher, we believe due in part to acceleration in 5G development leading to strong demand for 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer products. We now view Foundry Logic WFE to be second half-weighted versus our prior baseline of first half-weighted for calendar 2019.","Within Memory, customers have continued to take meaningful actions to restore supply and demand balance, reducing investment and lowering utilization levels for both NAND and DRAM, as we progressed through the June quarter. As a result, we see year-over-year bit supply growth for both NAND and DRAM continuing to decline, with bit supply growth rates exiting the year well below the long-term demand trend lines.","On the demand side, we are encouraged by early signs that NAND price declines are leading to an acceleration of content growth in devices. For example, SSD penetration in PCs is expected to reach nearly 60% by the end of 2019. But more importantly, the average density per drive is also growing. The predominant SSD configurations in the PC market are now 256 gigabyte and 512 gigabyte versus 128 gigabyte and 256 gigabyte a year ago.","The demand impact is amplified as both units and content per unit grow together. Similarly, we have seen acceleration in bit content growth for NAND and mobile devices. This is evident not only in the premium phone segment, but also in the mid-tier and lower-end phones, where 128 gigabytes offerings are seeing the fastest growth versus 64 gigabyte models a year ago.","We believe the combination of factors influencing supply and demand creates a favorable setup for Memory as we enter 2020. Our actions are focused on ensuring Lam is in the best possible position to benefit from the anticipated recovery in Memory spending. This focus is contributing to gains in both served market and market share as evidenced by wins this quarter across various applications, as well as in road maps for emerging 3D architectures.","In NAND, we are working closely with customers to develop differentiated solutions for potential limiters to 3D scaling. An excellent example is the wafer processing challenge created by stress-induced wafer bow as the number of 3D NAND layer scales to 100 and beyond.","Given Lam's leadership position in critical 3D NAND etch and deposition applications, we are best positioned to address this problem. The new Lam tool, which deposits a counter-stress film on the backside of the 3D NAND wafer, using an innovative single-step process has been introduced to leading-etch customers with multiple repeat orders received.","Importantly, the learning we gain through our investments to scale 3D NAND will be broadly applicable as new 3D architectures emerge in other segments. For example, we believe Lam's leadership in enabling 3D scaling will become increasingly valuable as logic devices migrate to a 3D gate all around structure in 3-nanometer as new memory such as PC RAM scale vertically for cost and bit density improvement, and as 3D heterogeneous integration is adopted as a preferred packaging option for high-performance system solutions.","For 3D heterogeneous integration, several leading companies across Foundry and Logic have announced architectures to connect different IP blocks using high-density interconnects with through-silicon vias. Lam's SABRE 3D electroplating and Syndion etch tools offer best-in-class technology backed by years of high-volume production leadership in the TSV market.","During the quarter we secured an important win at a leading logic customer for our SABRE 3D electroplating system for 3D chip stacking applications. This is a significant validation of Lam's ability to leverage its industry leading position in 3D scaling to new and emerging manufacturing inflections.","We are also seeing successes from our customer focused investments in DRAM. We are collaborating with customers on critical new technologies required to scale to the 1Z and 1A nodes. For instance, as DRAM shrinks, devices shrink to 1Z and beyond, the performance impact of resistance capacity delays becomes a challenge that must be addressed. This quarter, we won critical spacer applications at multiple leading DRAM manufacturers for the 1Z node due to our ability to deposit highly conformal low-k films that help reduce RC delay.","In addition to our progress on critical applications, you might recall that I have spoken previously about the NAND semi-critical process space and is an area of increased focus for Lam as we drive to gain market share.","In the most recent quarter, we began to deliver on this opportunity with significant conductor etch wins at multiple NAND customers for mask open applications. Specifically, Lam's ability to create a highly productive, single-step etch process to replace our competitor's multiple step approach allowed us to differentiate on system throughput, a key decision factor in the semi-critical space.","Another example is seen in dielectric etch where we recorded a key win for a semi-critical metal contact application at a leading memory maker. As 3D NAND scales, the peripheral context becomes deeper and aspect ratios increase. Our dielectric etch system demonstrated faster etch rates and superior profile control, leading to greater capital productivity and less frequent maintenance.","For our Customer Support Business Group, we continue to see 2019 as another year of solid revenue growth despite lower WFE spending. In the June quarter we achieved a second consecutive quarterly record for revenue from our Reliant Systems business as customers invest to address robust non-leading etch demand from end markets such as IoT, automotive and powered devices.","The combination of our focus on leading-etch technologies and installed base performance is being recognized by our customers. In the most recent quarter our top customer completed their annual supplier evaluation process, ranking us as their number one supplier as measured by a broad set of installed base performance, cost reduction and R&D engagement metrics. With this newest rating, we are now in the number one position in more than half of our top customers.","To wrap up, the near-term environment remains challenging. But the long-term growth opportunity for both our industry and for Lam is compelling. We are focused on executing to our commitments and extending the differentiation of our product and services portfolio.","I believe that our continued prioritization of customer focused investment would yield lasting benefits. And as Memory spending returns to normalized levels and non-Memory technologies increasingly rely on 3D scaling for performance and cost improvement, Lam will be in an excellent position to outperform.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today during what I know is a busy earnings season. Lam executed well in the June quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics.","Earnings per share exceeded the high end of the guidance range we provided due to stronger gross margin as well as proactive management of operating expenses. Our EPS performance is I believe are testament to our continual focus on delivering on our ongoing commitments.","As Tim noted, our expectation is that 2019 WFE will be down from calendar year 2018 in the mid-to high teens percentage level. Since our last call we're seeing some upside strength in Foundry, which was partially offset by a reduction in Memory spending.","From a segment perspective, our systems revenue for the combined Memory segment increased slightly to 64% of total system revenue from 61% in the March quarter. We had an increase from the March quarter in the non-volatile memory segment from 40% to 46%, while DRAM decreased to 18% from 21%.","Memory revenue continues to be mainly targeted towards conversion-related investments. In DRAM spending, it's targeted towards 1Y and some initial 1Z investment. In NAND, it's primarily convergence to non-auxiliary devices. Additionally, we are seeing initial investment on 128-layer structures.","We're continuing to see healthy spending in the Foundry segment which came in at 23% of our system revenue for the March quarter. And as Tim mentioned this is heavily focused on the 5 and 7-nanometer nodes. This was slightly down from 27% last quarter although still quite strong.","The Logic and Other segment was flat with the prior quarter level contributing 13% of system revenue. We expect to see continued strength in the Foundry and Logic space throughout the remainder of the calendar year.","It's worth noting that from a geographic perspective, 33% of our revenue was generated in the China region. The majority of this came from indigenous Chinese customers. We expect to see higher than our average concentration level of revenue in the China region for the September quarter as well.","We executed well on income statement performance for the June quarter. Revenues came in at $2.361 billion, which was above the midpoint of the June guidance. Gross margin for the quarter was 45.9% which was better than expected primarily due to customer mix and improved field resource utilization.","Also as we've stated in previous quarters, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as our raw business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter.","Operating expenses in the June quarter declined to $450 million from the prior quarter. We are proactively managing expenses with our lower revenue levels. We continue to invest in our strategic R&D programs however and remain focused on our commitment to technology and productivity leadership. The percentage of R&D spend increased to approximately 66% in the June quarter, which was a high watermark.","Operating income in the June quarter was $635 million and operating margin was 26.9% at the high-end of our guidance range. The non-GAAP tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 11% which is slightly lower than our long-term rate.","For the remainder of the 2019 calendar year, we expect a tax rate in the low to mid-teens. And I'll just remind you, you should expect to see fluctuations in the rate from quarter-to-quarter.","For June, other income and expense was a total of approximately $6 million of expense. This total includes interest expense for a full quarter related to the issuance of a $2.5 billion senior notes that we completed in the March quarter. The quarterly interest expense is partially offset by the interest income earned on higher cash balances for the company.","I'll just remind you that total interest expense on all tranches of our debt is approximately $45 million per quarter. We continued to execute on our capital return program during the June quarter. For the quarter, we allocated $1.3 billion to capital return with $1.1 billion coming in share repurchases and $165 million in dividend payments. ","Our share repurchase activities were from a combination of open market as well as structured repurchases. The structured repurchase program that we entered into is intended to continue to execute throughout our December quarter. We've completed approximately $2 billion of the $5 billion authorization that we announced in the March quarter.","Over the past 1.5 years, we've utilized approximately $6 billion in buybacks and lowered diluted share count by roughly 15%. I believe this demonstrates our continued commitment to return meaningful cash to our shareholders.","Earnings per share was $3.62, which was over our guidance range for the June quarter. This upside was driven primarily by better gross margin and lower-than-expected operating expenses. Diluted shares per EPS were approximately 154 million shares which reflects a 5% decrease in quarterly diluted share count since the beginning of the calendar year. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. The dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 converts is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.","Let me now move to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash decreased in the June quarter to $5.7 billion from $6.4 billion in the March quarter. The decrease is mainly due to the capital return activities within the quarter, offset by strong cash generation from operations of $880 million. This is the second consecutive quarter, where we had cash from operations in the $900 million range.","DSO decreased by five days to 56 days. Our inventory balance decreased by $82 million. Inventory turns remained at industry-leading levels coming in at 3.3 times. Company non-cash expenses included approximately $45 million for equity comp, $47 million for depreciation, and $18 million for amortization.","Amortization was down from last quarter by 50% as a portion of the intangibles from the Novellus acquisition have now fully amortized. Capital expenditures were $66 million in the quarter, which was a slight decrease from the $76 million that we saw in March.","The June quarter ended with approximately 10,700 regular full-time employees, which is down somewhat from the prior quarter. Additionally, I'd like to remind you that, we used temporary labor as part of our operating model. We have reduced this temporary labor by almost 40% or 600 head count in the last year. This flexibility is a critical part of our operating model enabling us to deliver sustainable operating profits during a time of reduced revenue levels.","So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2019 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2.150 billion plus or minus $150 million; gross margin of 45% plus or minus one percentage point; operating margin of 24.5% plus or minus one percentage point; and finally earnings per share of $3 plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 150 million shares.","Before closing my scripted remarks, I'd like to reiterate some of the tone that Tim shared in his script. We continue to not see a recovery in Memory spending which is our strongest market for 2019. We do observe dynamics in those markets, however, that are positive signs. Some examples of these signs are demand elasticity, pricing trends, and management of factory utilization to bring inventory down. We are tracking a double-digit number of new fabs ready to receive equipment shipments during this year and we see plans for that to happen again next year. We continue to believe as a result that 2020 sets up as a better year than 2019.","Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open-up the call for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take are our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A quarter ago, the supply side situation in Memory was one of disciplined spending and sort of reining in supply. It was really the demand side that was still uncertain, but just even over the past few weeks it seems that the demand side is starting to materialize here in the second half of this year PC market looking seasonally stronger cloud spending set to accelerate this quarter and you even have several big sort of AI in deep learning programs that are starting to fire. Your customers are also talking about inventory starting to come down. So is the Lam team feeling more confident, and more importantly your customers feeling more confident about the prospects for a healthier market environment exiting this year relative to three months or six months ago?","Tim Archer","Sure. Harlan, I'll take that and then Doug can add what he would like to. Clearly, I maybe \u2013 I walk you back since you kind of sets us as a baseline three or six months ago. The very first call of this year we laid out a view that Memory spending really wouldn't recover for this entire year. You just heard Doug kind of reiterate that again. But that didn't mean that through the year we wouldn't see progress, progress in sentiment progress in both the supply side and maybe the demand side. And so I guess, what I would say is incrementally you are hearing commentary about the demand side. I talked about elasticity. You've heard that also from some others even closer to those markets than us.","So I think that you're starting to see some sentiment in NAND that is \u2013 are positive signs. Back six months ago we also said that, given the timing in which NAND corrected versus DRAM that NAND corrected earlier, and therefore would be likely the first market where we would see end demand increases as well as pricing and market improvements. What we've tried not to do and it's just challenging given the uncertainty in the market is pin down exactly when that happened.","So we have put an end year supply growth rate number out there which was we said on the last call and we reiterate now in the range of about 30% supply growth for NAND as we exit the year. And that's about 10 points below what Lam sees as long-term demand growth. And so again, what we said is at that point it feels like the market will have tightened and investment could return, but obviously pinning that exact timing is challenging. I feel like the year in terms of supply improvement demand improvement discipline is playing out very close to what we thought it would with a whole lot of moving parts but in general and as I said directionally very much likely we thought at the beginning of the year. I don't know if Doug has anything to add.","Doug Bettinger","No. Perfect Tim. I don't really have anything to add. You're starting to see Harlan you alluded to it some of the early indications that the market is getting healthier is turning. And inevitably I think we all know it's a question of when not an if that memory spending will recover and that continues to be how we see it.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then on the heavier China domestic mix just, given the continued trade tensions U.S. and China which is actually motivating a number of the China-based companies to bring in more chip design domestically especially given some of the recent component bans and the delist additions. Have you guys seen an increase in dialogue or programs that suggest a step up on China domestic activities to accelerate their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities?","Tim Archer","Yes. I think it's hard to say to tie one directly to the other. What we said as we came into this year is that China domestic spending would be stronger this year than last year. And I would say that at this point in the year, we feel maybe it's even somewhat stronger than that and so demand from domestic China or indigenous Chinese customers is strong as Doug pointed out. I think to this point of exactly what's driving that I think there is obviously long-term demand and a long-term desire to build more domestic capability.","When I think about China, it's -- the biggest challenge for us really is the uncertainty that a lot of the trade discussions probably put not only the investment plans of indigenous Chinese customers, but also in the global players who are a little less certain about how those issues might play into the demand environment. So we're just trying -- we're managing through this. We've said our position in China is strong from a market share perspective and I think as you start to see some of the indigenous Chinese customers move into Memory, I would assume that our market share position should get even stronger. So, it's an important region for us but we track what's going on there closely and manage it as we see best.","Harlan Sur","Great.","Tim Archer","Thanks, Harlan.","Operator","We'll go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, you talked a little bit about your focus on addressing semi-critical applications in your prepared remarks. And I think you threw out an example in conductor etch where you managed to have some wins in the quarter. Just curious to semi-critical applications in general how meaningful is that part of the market as a percentage of etch and deposition? Where is your market share today? And how do you see that evolving over the next couple of years? And then I have a follow-up.","Tim Archer","Yes. That's a great question. In fact we said last time that as we move through the year and perhaps our Investor Day when we hold it next we might break out a little bit more detail on the size of semi-critical as a percentage of our total so we're not prepared to do that today. But it is -- the semi-critical is a meaningful part of the etch market. In terms of -- but I think it's also important and I really want to make sure that the message doesn't get lost.","Our core strength, our core business is the critical market, but if you have ambitions to grow and outperform the industry in the long-term, you have to also be competitive in semi-critical. And so, I think that we look at our performance in the last quarter I didn't talk about it, but we successfully defended critical positions in all markets in the last quarter. And so that was a statement and that's kind of how we go every quarter thinking we have to get done is defend our critical positions.","Where we have the opportunity to grow is by taking semi-critical positions away from the competition. There the defining factor is much more about productivity. As I think I mentioned in the last call or at least in one of our conferences, productivity is something that the company knows how to do by learning from what has been done for a long time on the deposition side where I would say a larger fraction of the market exists within the semi-critical space.","And so what we tried to highlight in the prepared remarks today is refocusing some of our efforts to ensuring that our productivity that we're delivering to customers is best-in-class can yield wins for Lam in the semi-critical etch space. We gave you examples both in the conductor etch space as well as the dielectric etch space. And so obviously that's -- can be interpreted as against two different competitors. So I think we're making progress there. I think just stay tuned and we'll continue to report how we're doing against those efforts.","Toshiya Hari","Got it. Thanks very much. And then as a follow-up, I was hoping to get an update on how you guys view EUV. How fast -- or how slow rather the technology is progressing on the Foundry and Logic side? How you see that impacting your business into 2020? And then more specifically I guess one of your customers recently sort of talked about potentially inserting EUV on the DRAM side of their business at the 1Z nanometer node. How do you see that evolving over the next 12 to 18 months? And how that could impact your business? Thank you.","Tim Archer","Sure. Okay. Great. It's funny, so maybe I'll just come out with a very clear statement at the beginning, because we get asked -- when the EUV question gets asked, it's often -- at least, I interpret it as kind of like, is this going to have a negative impact on Lam's business. So, I guess, what I'd like to start just by saying is, at this point we view Lam -- EUV as being good for Lam. And maybe I'll just run you through a couple of reasons for that.","I mean, we're aligned with this idea, which, I think, is held be many of our customers, that EUV is part of the answer to cost-effective scaling. And cost-effective scaling is what's needed for new technology nodes. New nodes are important to Lam, as you can guess. I just said our critical application business is the core of our business.","Critical applications, kind of, new ones get created when technology advances from node to node and so that's part of our growth strategy is, continue to win the next critical applications are being developed. New nodes also create SAM expansion opportunities for Lam. When there's a new node, I mean, there's new materials and new architectures where Lam can use etch and deposition more effectively. We win new positions.","And in terms of a negative impact, I mean, multiple patterning, we've said also very clearly, continues to grow even with EUV. We've said obviously, it doesn't grow -- multiple pattern, it doesn't grow as fast as if EUV doesn't exist. But, again, our view is, that's one of those hypothetical futures that, it's hard to say exactly how many wafers will get produced in the future of future nodes without EV. So, it's a long way of saying, I think, EUV in total is good for Lam.","Now, I also said, I think, on our last call that EUV is a big technology transition and you kind of pointed out, the speed with which it gets introduced has a lot to do with productivity. And we think that Lam has a significant role that we can play in helping improve, by using etch and deposition we can improve the productivity over the patterning module as a whole. And if we can do that, then it creates new opportunities for etch and deposition and we're partnering with ASML on those opportunities and I think we -- it's a big area of focus for us.","Specifically, to your question, like, for introduction in Logic and Foundry, I think, our view is consistent with industry consensus. So I don't have a lot to say there. Around the question of 1z insertion, again, I think you know probably what has been said. It's clearly not the general consensus that DRAM and D1z will commonly use EUV. I mean, it's a node where people will talk -- at least one customer, as you said, is talking about putting it in kind of as maybe the learning node. But I think that I don't have anything else to add to it than that.","Toshiya Hari","Thanks very much.","Tim Archer","Thanks, Toshiya.","Operator","We'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Tim at least by our math, if you look at kind of your June shipments into the Memory market, they're down about 50% plus or minus from sort of peak, but they're still up if you look at -- you're almost 50% from sort of the 2014 to 2016 average and there's been a lot that's going on with capital intensity, your SAM expansion, market share gains.","You guys have been very clear about not calling a recovery in Memory, but I'm kind of curious, how do you think about the current level of spending relative to prior troughs in Memory spending when you adjust for capital intensity going up, SAM growth, market share. Do you feel like we're bouncing along a bottom here in Memory, or how should we think about that?","Doug Bettinger","I mean the one thing, I would say, John, is that -- I would say and we've been saying this all year is, when I look at the spending in Memory this year, it is almost entirely allocated to conversion-related investments right? Which is always a cost-effective thing for the customer base to do, it lowers cost per bit.","I don't know that I would say, it's a maintenance level or it's a bottom level, John. But it's always something that economically is -- it makes sense for the customer to do it. And that's pretty much what we're seeing happening this year. And your observation about SAM intensity, capital intensity going up and all of that is absolutely valid. It's gotten more expensive to put wafers in place, because complexity of architectures have grown. And, obviously, that's part of the calculus as well. I don't know, anything to add, Tim?","Tim Archer","Yes. No, I think in terms of, especially, etch and depth intensity has changed in a pretty dramatic way since, what's the time? But I agree with everything Doug said. Our comments are -- have been, we're clearly at a point where we believe that supply growth spending is insufficient to meet long-term demand growth. So, however you want to call that, Doug, bottom or trough, as Doug said, we don't really want to do that, but it's -- this feels like the majority of investment is really around technology at this point.","John Pitzer","That's helpful. And then, as my follow-up, I was wondering if you can just give us update on kind of your view of the service business for this year, especially in lieu of sort of the some of the utilization cuts we've seen from customers. I know the installed base is growing, which will give a tailwind to service, but is that still expected to grow? And as you answer the question, one of your customers with the power outage this quarter, what kind of impact might that have had, either on the services or quite frankly in the shipment business?","Doug Bettinger","Yes. John, it's Doug again. Yes, I still expect our installed base business to grow this year. And again, your observation is absolutely right. This business will ebb and flow somewhat with industry overall utilization. And I think it's pretty well understood that some of the Memory -- some of our Memory customers are reducing utilization to a certain extent, including from a power outage. And so, as a result of that, things like spares consumption will decrease for a period of time. But this business will still grow this year. And it grows along with growth and chamber count.","And as we've been saying, our view even though WFE is down so much, chamber count will still grow this year. So the tailwind of the business over the next several years continues to be pretty good.","John Pitzer","Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, John.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks so much. Doug, I guess both of my questions are for you. The first one is I'm wondering if you can update us on the comments you gave, I think on second half versus first half loading?","Obviously, your full year WFE has not changed. But the mix has changed a little bit. It seems like maybe a little bit less in your favor. So can you update us on the second half versus first half of this year? Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah. Tim, yeah you're right the puts and takes. We're still suggesting WFE this year is down, mid-to high teens. And within that there are puts and takes. Memory is somewhat softer than we were describing, a quarter ago. And Foundry is a little bit stronger, maybe a decent amount stronger.","And when I look at the profile of that investment, the spending in Memory is somewhat first half weighted. The spending in Foundry and Logic is somewhat second half weighted. And when you put it all together, I think WFE this year will be a little bit weighted to the second half.","Timothy Arcuri","I guess Doug, I was more talking about your shipments, but I think you had previously guided your shipments or your revenue second half versus first half. So I'm wondering if you can update that.","Doug Bettinger","No. We've never guided revenue half on half. We've always and maybe I was misinterpreted talking about WFE.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, awesome. Okay and then I guess my second question Doug is you're doing $12 annualized in a pretty nasty Memory cycle systems for Memory are cut in half and total system shipments are down somewhere in the range of 14% from the peak.","Obviously it's much down than really anything in the past. So I guess the question is how do you think about how to optimize the capital structure in the balance sheet as you come out of this?","You have bought back a ton of stock but I'm wondering how you think about the right balance sheet leverage targets, as you look out over the next few years? Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah. Tim, I mean, I haven't communicated a numeric target for leverage or total cash or anything like that. But if you look at what we've done over the last several years I think we've had an inclination to provide meaningful cash back to shareholders. The cash generation capability of the business, continues to be amazingly strong right?","We're coming off two quarters now of nearly 900 -- or approximately $900 million from operational cash flow. So our confidence in the ability to sustain cash generation is obviously much higher.","And if you look at a metric like net cash, it's also why we've been comfortable bringing that down. And we've done that through raising, a little bit of debt and consuming the cash by both dividends and more towards share buyback.","At some point, we'll probably have an investor event again and talk a little bit more about it. But I'm not ready to change what we've described in the past, which has been we're going to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. And what you've seen us do is a whole lot more than that over the last several years.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay Doug got it. Thanks so much.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah, thanks, Tim.","Operator","We'll go next to C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse","Yeah. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, can you speak to on both Foundry Logic side. Your revenue intensity at the 16, 14, 10, nodes and how we think about share gains and\/or greater opportunities for you as we migrate down to seven and five?","And if there's any way to kind of quantify what the incremental revenues per wafer start or any sort of math like that, that will be very helpful. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah. C.J., I'm going to let Tim actually talk about the direction. We haven't quantified it. And we're not ready to do that on the call. But Tim is pretty well versed in the trajectory. So if you can cover that.","Tim Archer","Good they took the numbers off the table for me. But I think maybe the first time we've said and we feel quite confident is, in kind of the Logic Foundry world. Our share gains for a variety of reasons both through wins, but also new applications that we've gained our share gains are gains between 10, 7 and 5.","And so we feel quite confident that part of that is intensity in etching that deposition, part of that is new applications that created get created its new processes. And so, while we haven't quantified it, I would say that, as I said in my EUV commentary, every technology transition is an opportunity for us to gain new applications and gain share.","We feel really good about the progress we've made. It sometimes gets lost in the -- in this overlying story about memory and memory spending. And how much impact it has on our business. But we're feeling quite good about our momentum in Logic and Foundry both.","C.J. Muse","That's helpful. And as my follow-up, any update on your self-cleaning etch offering? I'd love to hear about the Kiyo module coupled with Corvus. Anything you can share with us would be great.","Tim Archer","Okay. Well, I'm not sure I can share with you other than it continues to progress in the marketplace. It's again, when I talked about semi-critical applications, where customers are really focused on trying to optimize the productivity of existing fabs. And one element to productivity of fab is how often you have to actually have technicians or people going and doing maintenance on tools.","And the Kiyo product with the Kiyo -- product with the Corvus Are, the self-maintaining tool is part of that answer. Now, obviously, there's not a lot of spending going on in some of those segments, but we feel this is another example of where we've introduced the right product that one spending recovers in the Memory market, they should be perfectly targeted to the types of tools that customers want to put in to all those new fabs they're building right now. Thanks C.J.","Operator","We'll go next to Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.","Krish Sankar","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Tim, one of the things I've been hearing is that actually go to higher and higher layers in 3D NAND, the process time for etch keeps going up. Is there a way to quantify in either absolute minutes or relative to prior nodes, what kind of increase in process times are we talking about, and what does it mean for Lam?","Tim Archer","Okay. Well, I don't think that we're going to quantify that because it's kind of a competitive piece of information that would -- we wouldn't want to divulge here, but it does, I mean, to your point it takes a longer time to etch higher aspect ratio features, and I think that it's relatively well known that that increase is non-linear with the number of layers, meaning, the etch becomes longer non-linearly with the number of layers that are being created. And that's simply due to the etch process physics themselves, physics and chemistry. And so more layers has a positive impact on -- for Lam on the number of etch tools that are required to accomplish that etch.","Now what I would say is that there's a constant battle, I mean, to keep the cost of ownership reasonable for customers, we're continuously working on productivity of every etch we deliver to the customer, including critical etches like the whole -- the 3D whole etch. So not prepared to quantify today, but it is a positive grower for us.","Krish Sankar","Got it. Got it. Okay. And then as a follow-up Tim. When you start gaining more share refocus more on the semi-critical etch applications how should we think about the margin structure, because it seems like productivity is key in this segment. Is productivity a euphemism for lower price, or just trying to figure out how to think about margins and you get more share in semi-critical etch?","Tim Archer","No. Definitely in my mind, it's not a euphemism for lower price. Productivity is in many ways is much of a technology challenges as any other. And so we're attacking productivity, we are attacking it fundamentally from equipment and hardware and process design in a way that we deliver increased productivity with the cost structure of the tool that allows us to deliver corporate average gross margins for those applications. That's our expectation. And so that sometimes takes time and will require us in many cases to think long and hard about how our tools are designed, but that is the expectation that I have for winning in that space.","Krish Sankar","Thanks Tim.","Tim Archer","Thanks, Krish.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Weston Twigg","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to probe a little bit about your comments on 2020. You said you think it's shaping up to be an up year, but I was wondering if you could just walk us a little bit through the puts and takes maybe both in Memory and Foundry what it would take be an up year? And sort of what your expectations are regarding those?","Doug Bettinger ","Yeah, West. Too soon for us to get into specifics on this. Really the commentary around setting up for a better year next year, it's all about Memory recovering in terms of investment levels. We'll give you more color on it when we get a little closer to next year, and I'm sure a lot's going to move around in there. But as we sit here today and look at the level of investment occurring in Memory and the growth rates of bits exiting the year and whatnot, we believe the level of investment there needs to go up next year and that's the nature of the comments.","Weston Twigg","That makes sense. I guess related to you talked about some new wins and focusing on market share gains and SAM expansion, some of the Syndion line today, can you help us maybe put some numbers around what -- how much that could expand the opportunity in 2020? The revenue opportunity deal for you?","Tim Archer","Well, I think maybe kind of no, but you should come back to the -- but you we're getting closer and closer to our market share targets that we put out for 2021. So I guess you can think of these as we've come out and we have said that we would gain four to eight points of share within etch and four to eight points within deposition by 2021. That was our last stated set of objectives.","And when you think about progress we already made in our share positioning critical that's where you move to semi-critical and you say a fair bit of that share gain four to eight points is going to come from those types of wins. That's why what we wanted to highlight today that we feel we're just at the start of making some of the progress towards that type of share gain.","Weston Twigg","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Tim Archer","Thanks West.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the strength in the indigenous China spending. How does that break down between Foundry DRAM, NAND and just generally your view on the sustainability of that spending into next year?","Doug Bettinger","Yeah. Joe, we described in the past view that plus or minus there's investment levels of $5 billion from indigenous China relative to WFE this year. As we look at it now, a little bit stronger than that quite honestly. The strength is coming from Memory primarily. And I think you know what's going on. There's several Foundry customers there the big one is SMIC. They continue to be a very important customer for us. You got YMTC investing in NAND and then emerging DRAM investments. The uptick relative to prior communication I think it's been primarily related to Memory both a little bit of NAND a little bit of DRAM.","Joe Moore","And the majority of the output that they're getting from that spending I mean is that something where you could see more kind of a larger capacity as we move forward, or is it more pilots and kind of getting things figured out?","Doug Bettinger","Yes. I mean, Joe, I think they're going to continue to keep innovating on the technology, they're going to keep getting better and better at what they do and it wouldn't surprise me if they can continue to invest at higher levels as we go forward. I'm not ready going to quantify it for you, but they're working very, very diligently on innovating the technology.","Joe Moore","Very helpful. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah. Thanks, Joe.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. I wanted to also ask about China. So sales were up 20% in the last fiscal year, non-China was down about that number. How do you measure utilization at your customers? Because their purchasing has gone up right around the time when trade tensions have increased. So is there a risk that there have been pull-ins and this becomes an issue later on?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Vivek when I look at it, I don't think there's significant pull-ins occurring in what we're seeing happening. And I say that because we sort of knew our customers' plans as the year began. And when I look at it for the most part, they're executing to those plans. It's also important I think to understand that a lot of the investment in China is not indigenous Chinese customers, right? You've got the Koreans building fabs, Taiwanese, U.S. companies. So understand that a broad swathe of the spending in China isn't necessarily the indigenous Chinese customers. That's generally how I see that.","Vivek Arya","Okay. And then for my follow-up Doug, on gross margins, you are guiding to 45%. And I know you mentioned a few times that mix changes from quarter-to-quarter. What in the mix is driving gross margins lower? Because when I look at the revenue level, it's kind of back to where it was in March 2017. But at that time gross margins were higher. But I recall at that time Foundry, Logic was a lower part of the mix. So is it Foundry, Logic that has an impact on gross margin? And I think you also alluded to the fact that you do expect to continue to grow in Foundry, Logic. So just how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins over the next several quarters?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Vivek, I wouldn't assume or you shouldn't assume there's differential gross margin by end of market necessarily meaning Foundry to Logic to Memory. That's not the way it works. Generally, there are -- it's what I always say that the larger customers, because they're buying more may tend to get a little bit better pricing simply because they're buying more from us relative to discounts sometimes. Not always, but obviously when you look at revenue down the way it is that's probably one of the bigger contributors right now. And Tim, would you want to...","Tim Archer","Yes, no. I think there's a -- you referenced back to a point in 2017. We look at those all the time to think about what's different in our business. And what you have to look at is that as we transition through 2017, it was a massive growth cycle for us. And while we have a very flexible operating model, some of the physical infrastructure that we have to put in place to meet a $3 billion quarterly revenue run rate some of that physical capacity has not been taken offline and it does affect gross margin to some degree. We are confident that that kind of physical capacity is what's needed to be able to respond when our customers do ramp as Memory spending recovers. So flexible operating model Doug talked about temporary workforce, but in some cases there were costs put in which are still with us. Doug, I don't know if you have...","Doug Bettinger","Yes. No perfect.","Vivek Arya","Great. Pretty helpful. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Patrick Ho with Stifel.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Tim, maybe to follow-up from your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the new emerging technologies such as gate-all-around and the industry transition in DRAM to 1Z and 1A. On the gate-all-around given that it's a similar format to FinFET, are there any capital intensity increases for etch and deposition that would benefit you guys when the industry makes that [ship] because you guys clearly benefitted from the transition of FinFET?","Tim Archer","Yes. I think that I mean what I was trying to message is that at almost every node our customers, the industry has realized that 3D scaling is a key part of the answer both to device performance as well as cost scaling. And for us 3D scaling really means etch and deposition intensity tends to increase. Obviously we're still a little ways away, I mean we're highly engaged with 3-nanometer but final decisions ultimately get made relative to structures and architectures in the future. But it's really a message around etch and dep intensity to create 3D architectures.","It's also why I pointed out in case it was missed the 3D architecture that's emerging in the heterogeneous integration or advanced packaging space, which again is 3D chip stacking and how Lam's etch and deposition will play a role in that. So what I was trying to just translate it I believe that 3D and etch and dep intensity kind of is fanning out across all device types in the future.","Patrick Ho","Great. And my follow-up question for Doug in terms of the installed base business that's probably providing you a lot of support this year, given the pressures on the systems business. Can you give a little color if you're seeing a lot of upgrade business for I guess the trailing etch, fabs that are trying to upgrade improve their productivity, is that a key driver to the installed base business, and the strength that you're likely seeing this year?","Doug Bettinger","That's certainly a piece of it. In fact last quarter, record level for our Reliant business, which is our refurbished equipment. So the answer Patrick is yes.","Patrick Ho","Thanks so much.","Doug Bettinger","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.","Sidney Ho","All right thank you. I've got two questions on the Memory side. You talk about NAND to supply growth rate exiting this year at about 30%. Can you give us a sense how you think the CapEx or the equipment spend needed to support say, every one percentage point of this supply growth from the current \u201cconversion-only\u201d trough? And can you do the same for DRAM? I guess we have -- you have given us the estimated cost for greenfield fabs before but just trying to put those pieces of information together.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah Sidney. No, I don't think we've quantified this in the past. And I don't think we're ready to on the call right now. So I'm going to decline to answer the question.","Sidney Ho","Okay. I'll move on to next one. If I take your reported revenue by end market and compare to what we think the WFE dollars for the various segments I can see that your share has been moving up steadily across all the different segments in recent years. But the one that stood out to me is NAND, which gets to be pretty high just take your revenue number that's probably including services and divide it by WFE, you get to somewhere around 40% from call it 20%, 25% a few years ago. Do you think that number could go higher as the market transitions to higher layer count? I guess, this question is whether it's sustainable?","Tim Archer","Well, I guess as -- what we've said is that etch and deposition are really key to continued scaling in 3D NAND and so etch and deposition intensity scales with number of layers. So from that perspective measuring share of the customer's total spend on 3D NAND, it will -- we do believe it can and will go higher.","Sidney Ho","Okay, great. Thanks.","Tim Archer","Thanks.","Tina Correia","Operator, I think we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am. We'll take our final question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves","Hi guys. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I just have one extra one on focusing on the share gain potential here. So I don't expect you guys to know exactly what happened to Japan and Korea, but if you look at the etch and deposition tools you guys sell, where do you guys think you had the most opportunity to gain share against Tokyo Electron?","Tim Archer","I'm not going to get specific but okay. Well, this is -- look and this is also why I talk about the importance of performing really well in the semi-critical space. Critical applications that the reason we like them is they're hard to win and it takes often a generation or two to sort of prove yourself out. Those are less likely to switch due to some short-term event.","Semi-critical or less critical applications are much more driven by can you accomplish that task at a certain targeted productivity point? So I think that there are a number of applications that we would be targeting where we're highly capable of doing those. And if the customer is motivated to give Lam a try, we're motivated to jump in there and show what we can do.","Mitch Steves","Got it. And just one real quick high level one. I don't know the exact math off the top of my head, but roughly speaking from the last downturn you guys have seen, do you guys see anything irregular in terms of buying patterns? Suggest that people are buying ahead, or buying additional equipment than normal down cycle, or do you think this is essentially a normal semi cap cycle that you see in the past?","Tim Archer","No. Nothing from my perspective that's out of the ordinary. In fact that was why I kind of started my comments with. For the most part, given some different puts and takes the year's playing out not that differently than we had originally thought from the standpoint of moving through a down cycle in Memory.","Mitch Steves","Perfect. Thank you.","Tim Archer","Yeah, thank you.","Doug Bettinger","So, operator, I think that's the end of the call. If you want to sign us off.","Tina Correia","Thank you, everyone, for joining.","Operator","Yes, certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"13450":["Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) Q1 2013 Earnings Call October 17, 2012  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Shanye Hudson - Director of Investor Relations","Ernest E.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Lam Research Corporation September 2012 Quarterly Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Shanye Hudson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you, Britney. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Lam Research Corporation's quarterly conference call. Here with me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ernie Maddock, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Shortly, Ernie will discuss financial results for the September 2012 quarter, and Martin will then share Lam's business outlook for the December 2012 quarter before we open the call for Q&A. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed over wire services shortly after 1 p.m. this afternoon and is also available on our website at lamresearch.com.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements including those related to our expectations for the global macroeconomic environment; market size; wafer fabrication equipment spending; the revenue expectations of shipments to our Japanese customers; technology trends and transitions that may affect our business; market share changes; consumer demand; customer spending and behavior and the factors that will influence those expectations, as well as our spending projections; our investment plans; our business strategies; our expectations of the benefits resulting from our Novellus acquisition; our intentions for research and development activities; our contemplated tax rate and our forecast of market shares, shipments, revenues, expenses, margins, operating profits, share repurchase activities, earnings per share and cash generation, both on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis, as well as other statements of the company's expectations, beliefs and plans.","There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements, and a list of these factors can be found in the slide package accompanying this conference call as well as on our most recently filed Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are based on current information and the company assumes no obligation to update any of them.","This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 p.m., and we ask that you please limit questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up.","With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Ernie.","Ernest E. Maddock","Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report good results for the quarter ended September 23. All metrics mentioned on today's call are for the combined company. And as a reminder, the September quarter results include a full quarter of merger-related activity, while any June quarter comparisons reflect only 20 days work.","Total shipments were $935 million for the September quarter, up 15% from the June quarter and within our previously guided range. As expected, we did see a slight broadening of customers across multiple segments. And to that point, for the September quarter, approximately 20% of our system shipments were for technology nodes greater than 4X, while the remainder of approximately 80% were for applications at the sub-4X technology node.","Segment data is as follows: Foundry shipments accounted for 48% of total system shipments, while the memory segment accounted for 42% of total system shipments, which include NAND at 22%; DRAM at 19%; and other memory at 1%. Constituting the balance, logic and other were 10% of the total system shipments.","Revenue in the September quarter was $907 million, up 22% sequentially and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 44.4%, up 2.3 percentage points from the prior quarter and exceeding the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to solid operational execution and a more favorable product and customer mix.","Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $284 million, up sequentially from $215 million in June. A more instructional comparison would be the performance of the 2 companies on a stand-alone basis during the March quarter where combined expenses totaled $293 million. Between $5 million and $6 million of the reduction relates to the achievement of OpEx related synergies, while the remainder relates to lower stock compensation expense associated with merger-related acceleration of equity awards.","The combination of higher gross margins and lower operating expenses resulted in non-GAAP operating income of $118 million and non-GAAP operating margin of 13%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range.","Relative to our expectations for the quarter, non-GAAP other expenses of $2.2 million was favorably impacted by foreign currency adjustments and interest income.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.3% compared to 16.9% in the June quarter. And presently, we're still expecting a fiscal year non-GAAP tax rate in the mid-teens. Should the federal R&D tax credit be extended prior to our fiscal year end, this rate would be reduced to the lower teens.","Based on a share count of approximately 182 million shares, September quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.53, exceeding the high end of this quarter's guidance by $0.06.","Moving now to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash and investments of $2.9 billion versus $3 billion in the prior quarter, with our cash generation for the quarter being offset by our ongoing share repurchase program.","Day sales outstanding for the September quarter were 64, and inventory turns were 4.0. As you know, we did not report these metrics for the June quarter as the 20 days stub period related to the Novellus transaction caused these metrics to be unhelpful.","During the September quarter, these metrics for the combined company are aligned with normalized levels. And for comparison, DSO for the March quarter for Lam stand-alone were 65 days, and the inventory turns were 4.2.","We ended the quarter with deferred revenue of $364 million, excluding approximately $21 million in the shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters.","Cash from operations was $249 million or 27% of revenue in the September quarter. And we currently expect that as a percentage of revenue, CY '13 cash from operations will approximate CY '13 non-GAAP operating income.","Combined company noncash expense includes, among other items, $24 million for equity compensation, $45 million for amortization and $30 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $44 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 regular full-time employees.","Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on our ongoing share repurchase activity.","During the September quarter, we spent approximately $344 million repurchasing shares and took delivery of about 12 million shares of common stock, which includes just over 2 million shares received in conjunction with our June quarter expenditures under structured repurchase programs. As indicated previously, our activity during the quarter was more systematic in nature, and we now expect to complete a significant majority of our $1.6 billion share repurchase during 2012.","With that, I'll turn it over to Martin.","Martin B. Anstice","Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite well-publicized adverse market conditions recently and the associated ongoing cyclical pressures, Lam delivered on all key customer and financial commitments for the September quarter. These achievements reflect incredible levels of commitment from our employees worldwide, continued focus on operational execution and the unwavering focus on our customers and our strategic growth objectives. We're very pleased with our progress.","First today, I'll briefly update our views on the industry. Since our last call, a number of customers lowered their investment plans for the balance of this calendar year. Accordingly, we have further lowered our 2012 wafer fabrication equipment spending outlook to a $28 billion to $29 billion range. Having essentially met September guidance, this adjustment impacts the December 2012 quarter significantly, particularly in the area of shipments. Again, the NAND segment accounted for the vast majority of this latest series of spend reductions as manufacturers continue to react to the pricing environments and their view of supply and demand.","Given the decrease in new capacity additions planned for the balance of calendar '12, we think it is likely they exit this year with very tight NAND device supply, which bodes well for a resurgence of spending in calendar '13, probably in the first half.","Clearly, there is some evidence we are already seeing the impact of this supply situation in NAND ASPs, which has started to increase over this past quarter. This is an important reference point for confidence in future capacity expansion.","While it is still too early to accurately forecast 2013 WFE spend to any significant detail, our initial analysis still supports the prospect for spending, once again, to be within a range of $30 billion.","Smartphones, tablets and SSDs support the need for new NAND capacity and additional leading-edge foundry and logic investments. These drivers are also positive for mobile DRAM demand. However, projections for PC unit growth and DRAM content growth continue to be modest, resulting in another year of limited DRAM equipment spending, most likely.","Considering the fundamentals of WFE capacity and our understanding of demand for electronics products, we would characterize the 2013 WFE spend to have more potential for upside than risk. Needless to say, the often unrelated macro influences independent of the semiconductor cycle are significant to the risk and upside both.","As you might expect in this environment, Lam is even more focused on executing well, managing short-term volatility but staying the course on the primary elements of our longer-term market share growth objectives. We'll spend more time in our upcoming Analyst Meeting in November, focused on communicating progress to date on these long-term items, characterizing their magnitude and the probability of our excess -- of our success exploiting market opportunities and technology inflections.","In calendar year 2013, we expect customers to begin ramping capacity additions for the n+1 technology node, which includes the transition to 40 [ph] -nanometer for logic and 20-nanometer for foundry. Potential 3D NAND pilot line investments could also begin late in the year. But primarily, we are assuming a planar-based memory WFE for now.","For Lam, these transitions represent key opportunities and support achieving our stated market share growth objectives. We're pleased with our progress.","It goes without saying that successfully defending existing positions is the most critical foundation of market share sustainability. Building off that foundation with targeted application penetrations to gain share is our proven growth model.","In etch, clean and deposition, we continue to defend positions well. We believe that approximately 70% of the critical n+1 technology node tool selection decisions have been made at this time. And on that basis, we would estimate our application-based market share for etch, clean and deposition in the low 50s, low to mid-20s and mid-20s percentage range, respectively.","Especially in etch and deposition, recent selection decisions by our customers have demonstrated good progress towards our goals. In clean, we are now more focused on n+2 transitions with the planned release of our next-generation product next year.","In the remaining 30% of n+1 decisions available and n+2 decisions that will be made in earnest throughout next year, we are targeting additional growth hinged around key technology inflections consistent with achieving our 3- to 5-year targeted market share growth objectives of plus 3 to 5 percentage points for etch, 5 to 10 percentage points for clean and 4 to 8 percentage points for deposition.","In etch, as market share leader for the conductor segments and particularly for critical patterning processes, Lam stands to benefit from the growing number of patterning steps in next-generation foundry and memory devices.","In single wafer clean, we have a position of leadership in back-end-of-line applications and are now focused on delivering enhanced productivity and differentiated process results to better compete for a broader range of applications, including the front-end cleans.","Since the last earnings call, our design solutions have generated considerable interest from leading device manufacturers, with the promise for delivering a flexible architecture and on-wafer performance capabilities aligned with their roadmaps.","Decisions for clean process steps often come later in the selection process as we talked about previously, and we believe there are still opportunities to capture new applications at the n+1 technology node.","In deposition, Lam holds the leading position for critical back-end-of-line interconnect processes, including diffusion barriers, ultra-low-k film gearing and copper fill. The complexity, in some cases the number of interconnect layers, is increasing, which requires more deposition systems to process the same number of wafers.","As a newly formed combined company, we, Lam and Novellus, are more competitive together, and the timing of our transaction fits well with industry transitions. Illustratively, the 3D NAND devices roadmap represents a significant growth opportunity for both etch and depositions, sometimes together through adjacent process leverage. Repeatable and precise process capabilities are critical to 3D NAND device performance, our ability to etch high aspect ratio structures and deposit atomically smooth film stacks both uniformly and repeatedly position us well for opportunities in dielectric etch and PECVD both.","Overall, we're delighted by the interaction and excitement shared among our combined engineering and field organizations, more by the results already evidenced to identify and develop strategies for accelerating Lam's growth.","Worthy of note, we are already targeting incremental revenues in calendar '13 in excess of our stated synergy cost reductions. We continue to execute plans to combine our key business processes, management systems and infrastructure. The magnitude of these projects is sizable and includes, among other areas, the integration of both company's IT infrastructures, HR platforms and the integration of our ERP systems and processes.","We completed a thorough assessment of these projects early on and have developed plans which address potential risks. I'm pleased with the pace and progress of our efforts so far, which we are largely targeting to complete by mid-2013, when a number of step function cost synergy actions become possible.","Since closing the Novellus transaction in early June, we've made significant progress against our cost synergy targets. We are rationalizing our infrastructure at the executive level and across our regional management team and support organizations. We are nearly compete -- complete in our efforts to consolidate field offices and spare depots worldwide. We have started to eliminate duplicate corporate fees relating to outside services, and we have successfully concluded initial cost savings negotiations with a number of key material suppliers.","To date, these actions have resulted in annualized cost savings of approximately $25 million. Our strategy is to run the company at a lower combined cost than the 2 stand-alone companies would have done separately, remaining committed to long-term growth and, where necessary, sustained long-term investments.","Subsequent to our prior earnings call, we had received a number of questions about CY '13 operating expenses. We plan to deliver a comprehensive commentary on this at our November Analyst Meeting, but for now want to convey some important headlines.","The combined company cost baseline for the first half of calendar 2012 was approximately $295 million per quarter in OpEx. Stand-alone Lam had essentially capped operating expenses for calendar '12 to $200 million per quarter, and Novellus, $100 million. The combined company targeted cost synergies are $100 million annualized effective at the end of calendar '13. Approximately 50% of those synergies are planned in operating expenses.","The new quarterly operating expense cap is less than $305 million per quarter for the combined company in calendar '13, which would apply to the $1 billion quarterly revenue level. This amount would include our anticipated cost synergies. It would fund above market growth and would accommodate ramping 450-millimeter equipment development. Initial modeling should assume a graduated progression through the year. Customary quarterly guidance will, of course, be available ongoing. We anticipate, at least currently, only modest OpEx expansion in subsequent years.","This balanced approach to managing costs while continuing to invest for future growth is crucial in today's rapidly changing business climates and with high risk and reward industry inflections. We feel that this target optimizes short- and long-term performance appropriately.","Turning now to our outlook for the December 2012 quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: Shipments of $800 million, plus or minus $30 million; revenues of $850 million, plus or minus $30 million; gross margin at 44%, plus or minus 1%; operating profit at 11%, plus or minus 1.5%; and earnings per share of $0.45, plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 172 million shares.","And with that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with the Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First, in terms of the outlook for the December quarter, can you just give a little color, in terms of percentages, what you're expecting in terms of the different customer groups?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, for sure. As you might expect, relative to the shipments breakdown, there's a fair amount of intensity around foundry and kind of logic\/other. So I would assume that about a 50% profile for foundries, 25% level for logic\/other and about 25% with memory. And within that, memory sets a pretty heavy weighting towards DRAM upgrades is the profile that we see right now.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. The foundries moved to the -- both, I guess the 28- and the 20-nanometer nodes. You're seeing the increased talk about going to FinFET technology for the foundries. Can you give a little bit of color of where Lam is well-positioned in terms of that process technology or where you think you can gain share?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. I guess, the first, I'll break that into kind of 2 components, 28 to 20. As I think we've articulated previously, that's a pretty expensive transition for the foundries. I think the estimates are between 1.3x and 1.4x in terms of cost. And our best estimates in terms of impacts on the etch fab [ph] are between a 25% and a 35% increase in spending. Naturally, the types of challenges around metal hard mask transitions in that node are definitely appealing to the natural strength of the company in terms of conductor etch. And certainly, that's a very positive headline for the company. As you move towards the FinFET transition, obviously, there's some announcements around adoption of the 16-nanometer or sometimes referred to 18-nanometer node. And again, the types of profile challenges that exist with the vertical structure kind of naturally exploits the strengths of the company conductor etch in the logic space, but also demonstrated performance in high-aspect ratio features in some of the memory applications as well. So we're feeling pretty good about the impact on our SAM in those transitions, which we think is kind of pretty close to the average WFE transitions for the industry, for the 28 to 20, maybe a little less in the case of etch, as I just spoke to. And the FinFET transition for us is probably a 15% increase in SAM. So good position and good impact in terms of SAM opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Martin, I just wanted to follow-up on your comment on the 2013 CapEx outlook. Can you talk about your assumptions for both memory and logic foundry spending and that $30 billion number? And then I will follow-up.","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. I guess first thing to say is we assume both memory and logic and foundry spend money next year. As I think we've articulated probably in equal measure through the year, the breakdown that we're assuming for 2012, WFE is about $8 billion of memory, $5 billion of microprocessor, $12 billion of foundry and $3 billion logic\/other. The principal change we believe that exists in terms of segments if you buy into the $30 billion that we've just described, is that memory is a little stronger. It goes from the $8 billion level to the $10 billion level. That's the placeholder we're assuming. And there are a couple of reasons for that. One of them is that for the assumptions we're making on DRAM bit growth, and I think they're consistent with consensus, is slightly stronger bit growth next year at the high 30s. And I'm seeing some memory companies perhaps even speak to a little bit better in some instances. So we're assuming high 30s on the back of a 30% 2012 year. And despite the current environments that we're in with NAND, when we look at the construct of today's installed base and think through the 50% bit growth assumption for 2013, we would estimate that there will be about a 150,000 wafer starts of capacity addition next year and about 450,000 wafer starts of capacity conversion. And that is a slightly richer ratio biased to the additions that existed in calendar '12. Calendar '12 was the most efficient year in NAND history. That's certainly in the last 3 years relative to the mix of addition and conversion. And the 150,000 wafer start number that I just said is our assumption for next year NAND additions. It's still meaningfully less than the additions that were made in 2011 and 2010.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And just one other follow-up. If let's say, industry WFE is up 10% next year, in that scenario, how do you think about Lam's revenue growth given the rising etch intensity at 20-nanometer?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. I mean, I think I've framed the first part of the answer to the question for you in terms of the SAM expansion. So you're going to have to kind of build the construct from that because we're not about to kind of launch into giving guidance for the calendar year revenues. But I think the message in terms of SAM expansion through the 28 and the 20 transition for foundry and the opportunity through the memory roadmap is positive. And the n+1 market share numbers that I presented to you in my prepared comments were all positive to the current baseline, so you know what we're targeting to achieve. And certainly, in the second half of next year, n+1 will begin to feature in the spending of WFE.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of quick ones. Martin, you seem to be more positive on near-term etch and deposition share gain than you do on clean. What types of customers or what types of applications do you think you'll gain share at in those products over the next year or 2?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, the good news is I seem to be more positive because I am a little bit more positive, at least in the near term. As I've described before, I feel really good about the competitive strength of the company in clean in the back-end-of-line. But until we have our next-generation product, we're not going to have the competitive differentiation that I think will deliver the traction in market share gain in clean. And that's something that will be with us targeted in the middle of next year. For etch, well-positioned in terms of 28 to 20 transitions. And as I said, 70% of the decisions, the n+1 decisions for critical applications, we believe, are pretty complete at this point in time. So we have reasonably good data on the etch position in foundry. And the patterning layers and hard mask steps in that transition are very beneficial to us given the natural strength of the company in conductor etch deposition. As I mentioned, it's really all about back-end-of-line process, diffusion barrier, copper fill, very strong market share positions for the company as a baseline. I mean, the DCV [ph] position of the company is about a 70% market share, so we're coming from a position of strength. And that's obviously a very important foundation.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then last question was tied to residual Novellus revenue prior to the acquisition. I want to know how that plays into your guidance for the fourth quarter if it does play at all into that?","Ernest E. Maddock","Yes, Chris, this is Ernie. As we mentioned, by the December quarter, there is virtually no quarterly impact resulting from that change in rev-rec policy because there'll be as much flowing into the revenue stream in the December quarter as there will be deferred. So that impact is largely behind us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Martin, just a question as you plan ahead into early 2013. How are you initially planning to see WFE spend trending in the March quarter? It sounds like NAND is a first half opportunity, in the full year it should be strong. Are you planning for the December quarter to likely be this near-term trough quarter?","Martin B. Anstice","So I'll give you kind of couple of data points. Obviously, to really put a stake in the ground on the proportion of WFE first half and second half next year is pretty difficult. But we would probably assume a slightly weaker first half than second half. And whether it's 14 or 16 or something slightly different, that's the baseline I would assume for now. In terms of answering the question specifically about where kind of a NAND investment kind of plays out, today, our customers have done an incredible job basically locking down qualified capacity. And so the amount of capacity that's unqualified exiting this year, I think it's at an all-time low. So if there's any demand, it's going to, by its very nature, require capacity addition. So I think the switch is going to be really immediate when demand exists. And when you look at some of the signals of demand, I mean, we're not lost without demand signals. So although we don't disclose bookings, perhaps to be a little helpful, if -- when we look at our forecast, our bookings forecast in December is slightly greater than our shippings guidance -- shipments guidance today. So the trajectory that appears to exist would tend to support March being better in terms of business activities than December. But as we all learned in this quarter, things can change very quickly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, a couple of questions. Just a clarification on this December bookings comment. Is December bookings up from September directionally?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I'm not going to comment because -- I had a feeling if I said something about bookings, someone's going to ask a follow-up. So I'm going to tell you exactly what I told you. And we've got some bookings-to-shipment ratio that's positive in our outlook in December, but that's the color you get on bookings unfortunately.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, I just thought I would try. Another -- a question on your logic shipments. Embedded guidance that you're talking about for logic shipments in your December, if I just do the math, logic is up almost 2x. Your September numbers, I don't if I got that right or not, that seems to be in contrast with what we're hearing as weakness in the PC space and generally investor concerns of equipment reuse. Is this share gain on your part or less than a perfect understanding, by perhaps investors, on what the equipment needs are for the logic segment longer term?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I mean, at some level, it may be a -- it's certainly assumed that it's in the category of smaller numbers on an absolute basis. So the percentages tend to kind of swing around a little bit. I don't think we've got a fundamental market share message we're communicating to you. I think it's a fairly distributed set of people spending money. You're absolutely right to make the point around reuse, at least in the microprocessor space, as being relevant to the purchasing activities today and maybe even in the December quarter as well. So we don't really have a kind of fundamental share gain message to be communicating. But the math that you did is certainly in line with the assumptions that we're making today.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mark, on the opportunity that you articulated about improvement in NAND CapEx for next year, what's the risk that the first thing that happens is that we move some of the excess DRAM capacity over to NAND before we see new NAND capacity expansion? Recognizing that I think your logic on NAND price is improving on the heels of a lower CapEx this year makes perfect sense, but might we have to eat through some excess DRAM capacity that gets transitioned over before we see new NAND orders?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I mean, I think if you kind of back up 3 to 4 years, that was a much more kind of prevalent reality than it's been for some time. In the last 12 months, we've seen a couple of customers talk about it and\/or do it. And in fact, the transitions have actually gone the other direction to the one that you're hypothesizing, at least in Korea, or I think that's the reality. It's not an easy thing to do. It can be a little costly and complicated and challenging. So we're not actually sitting here today with a very misbalanced supply and demand in DRAM. I mean clearly, the guys that sell DRAM devices can make the choices that you're describing and potentially the economics of DRAM, unless you're in the mobile DRAM space, are going to kind of motivate people to at least consider it, but it's not easy. So we're not seeing a big supply demand imbalance despite the fact that clearly the economics of DRAM, unless you're at 3X mode or headed to 2X, are very difficult. But it is at least a theoretical consideration.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess if I could just use this as my follow-up. So you're articulating a scenario of flat-top wafer fab equipment spending next year. Is it fair to say that if the biggest logic customer and\/or the biggest memory\/foundry customer is going to be down 30% that, that's not baked into that $30 billion wafer fab equipment forecast? In other words, in that $30 billion, you're not assuming any of your large customers decline significantly, is that right? So if that were to happen, that's incremental downside to your forecast?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. I mean, it's pretty hard to argue a global WFE that is disconnected from the realities of spending by the top 3 guys. They represent 60% to 70% of spending these days. So you're generally kind of right, I would say. Again, there's not a huge amount of science at this point to -- at least too precision here, and I do think we're biased to see a little bit more upside. The only thing that we've kind of assumed in terms of growth year-over-year from a segment point of view is in the NAND space for the reasons I've described. At least our assumption on the PC, which is still pretty impactful in terms of spending, we're only assuming 3% PC unit growth, and the range is like wild. I mean, I've seen minus 1% or minus 2% percentage point estimates all the way up to 11%. So we're in a fairly conservative range at the 3%. So I don't know if there's upside there or not. Well, time will tell. And there's the potential for some upside, I think, if the 3D NAND transition and\/or the 20-nanometer foundry roadmaps kind of pop a little bit faster than people are expecting. But at least for us, in the $30 billion, we're pretty conservative on all of those.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering on the gross margin improvement this past quarter, how much of that was contributing from this broadening on customer? And as we move to the new year, as some of these bigger customers come back and spend, are you worried that those bigger contract with those big customer might impact gross margin?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, the customer concentration kind of reality, I think, for every equipment company is the more the big guys spend, the tougher it is to make money. So certainly, the evidence of the last 12 months has shown that to us. And frankly speaking, despite our best efforts, it's probably a legitimate part of our future. Actually, in the September quarter, the mix that's in there relative to the top 3 is actually pretty reasonable. It's not a kind of wildly concentrated profile and it's not wildly distributed profile. The top 3 customers represent a fairly reasonable assumption for their share on an ongoing basis. So it's not a bad stake in the ground.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I see. Okay, great, that was helpful. And then I guess going back to NAND, you mentioned that you guys are well-positioned for 3D NAND transition which could potentially start some part in the back half. Do you see a scenario where some of these NAND customers want to delay the spending because they know that they're going to transition to the 3D NAND in back half of next year or maybe 2014, and therefore result in lower levels of NAND spending in the coming year?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. I mean, we're -- as I said in my prepared comments, we're assuming that in the $30 billion, it's all about planar NAND. So we got like next to nothing assumed for 3D. Relative to the timing of the transition, it's not an easy technical transition. There's still a decent set of unanswered questions on device flow and structure. And evidence of that is we are continuing to learn about our SAM opportunity. So you will remember in kind of prior quarters, I have said that if you look at kind of etch as a -- etch and deposition as kind of baselines for our company today, and you start to model what happens to our SAM or what happens to the cost of 10,000 wafer starts in a planar to 3D transition in the FinFET space and the NAND space, I had said I believe that our SAM goes up by about 15 percentage points by virtue of process time and process flow. And in the last kind of 6 months, the customers made some pretty significant choices around NAND process flow. And I would say that, that 15% that we have stated previously is probably underestimating the opportunity in etch and clean, both by up to a 2 to 3x factor. So the 15-percentage point number that we have said previously has the potential to be 2 or 3x greater than, that in this transition. So it's a very big deal. And that's a big deal in the context of overall WFE because unlike in the logic transition, the requirements for lithography actually get eased in that transition to a 3D structure memory. So not only is it a big deal in terms of the amount of money that gets spent in our segments in a 3D NAND environment, the proportion of WFE that gets assigned to the segments of our business is also increasing.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question for you on gross margins. In terms of the 44% for Q4 guide, how should we think about the trajectory thereafter? And I guess what I'm getting at is, is there a benefit there in terms of deferred revenue contribution? How should we think about the synergies rolling in? And I guess, given your construct of kind of second half more heavily weighted than the first half, we'd kind of love to get a feel for how you see that trajectory through the calendar year.","Ernest E. Maddock","C.J., this is Ernie. So at sort of even revenue volumes, I think you would see continued incremental progress on the gross margin line as the result of the synergies associated with that. Obviously, you're going to have an impact from customer and product mix as well. So I wouldn't say you would see any significant upward trajectory, but certainly, the opportunity exists for there to be some incremental improvement.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up, and forgive me if you've discussed this, but curious what you could share in terms of share repurchase with all the excess cash and how you plan on, I guess, using that going forward.","Ernest E. Maddock","So certainly, we're going to be executing on the balance of the $1.6 billion share repurchase. As we talked about in our prepared comments, the vast majority of that will be complete in this calendar year. Beyond that time, we're engaged in discussions with the board about an appropriate way to ensure an ongoing return of cash we generate to our shareholders, and we'll be providing further updates to that as it becomes more clear to us.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Two questions, Ernie. First -- on the first one, you guys have talked about 3D NAND. I just was wondering and you also talked about the build [ph] in n+1. So I was wondering how well are you guys positioned with all the 4 major NAND producers in terms of 3D NAND? And then I have a follow-up.","Martin B. Anstice","I'm not sure I got all of the question, but I -- certainly, in terms of the n to n+1 transition, for us in NAND, certainly, that is solid and there are penetrations assumed in the market share objectives that I've previously described in terms of kind of planar device. From a positioning point of view in the 3D structure, I think across the full portfolio of products, we've got the right engagements at the right time with the right people. As I mentioned, there's a lot of decisions still to be made, a lot of uncertainty, not just in timing, but in terms of the ultimate construct of the flow. And so it's a big part of the investment profile in the company, it's a big part of collaborating and engaging with R&D at the customers, and we're at every significant location we need to be.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just on the -- as a follow-up on the foundry space, people are talking about this ramp in 20-nanometer in the second half. I just wondering how much amount of reuses there on the 20-nanometer are potentially do you think you could benefit from double patterning in that?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, the answer, I guess, to the second part of your question, there is really the 28 to 20 numbers that I already kind of disclosed to you. I said I thought 25% to 35% was the SAM expansion potential for etch, deposition a little less than that and clean is kind of to be determined. It's all about a yield play. So we really don't know how to answer that question until we get there. And there is a reasonable potential for -- in the range of 25,000 to 30,000 wafer starts of 20-nanometer capacity to be added next year. That's our assumption right now. And so it's predominantly a 28-nanometer year still. I mean, we exit this year at maybe at 240,000 wafer starts, and we believe that the 28-nanometer technology nodes will exceed 300,000 wafer starts ultimately and maybe get to as high as 340,000 or 350,000. We'll see. So it's really a 28 year, with initial 20. Answering the reuse question is pretty difficult at this point. I would tend to think reuse potential is very low. It's not an established model in the foundry, certainly in the 40 to 32 and 28 transitions. There was a little bit more than historically. But it's a tough place to do reuse on any significant scale.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This question relates to the foundry business. If we look ahead into 2013, and if we were to see a significant shift regionally toward a strengthening Taiwanese foundry away from a weakening Korean foundry, how would that affect some of your near-term market share goals in etch and deposition and clean?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I don't think it affects the near-term goals in the slightest, personally. But ultimately that's a by-product of decisions that customers make, not us. I do think if you kind of peel the onion of market share for Lam Research in etch, using etch as a proxy, we're reasonably agnostic to the choices and the transitions geographically across the base of foundries. And the obvious exception to that obviously is a company like Intel to the extent that it is -- have plans to or chooses to pursue business in a foundry model, which gets talked about in the press all time, and I have no idea if that ever happens. But that's the only one exception. Everything else, we're reasonably agnostic to, by virtue of where we have applications penetrated and the differences in the process flows between the foundries.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Terrific. And then the follow-up question I have is regarding the change in OpEx from roughly $284 million to approach maybe $305 million by year end '13. Just to understand, is that a fairly linear ramp? And also how much of that would be in cash OpEx versus stock compensation?","Ernest E. Maddock","Terence, it's probably reasonable at this point, and I would stress that we haven't yet completed our 2013 annual operating plan where we would have that level of visibility. But it is reasonable to think about that on a linear basis. And it's reasonable to think about at least half of that delta being in noncash-related expenses, be it stock compensation or depreciation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Martin, I had a question in terms of the front-end-of-line clean. As you guys try to get into the FEOL clean and your competition goes from front-end-of-line to back-end-of-line clean, are you guys using the same products? Are you guys developing new products to attack this market?","Martin B. Anstice","We're planning to do, we're -- as maybe the framework for answering the question, because the products that we're targeting to release is a calendar '13 product release for us, is building upon the established strengths of the company, which is to have a common architecture that we use to penetrate in many applications and then to have kind of like an options flexibility that allows customization to specific back-end applications and front-end. It is a new product, yes. It is much more productive than the platform that we're able to compete with today, and so it fundamentally changes the competitive position of the company on productivity. And we are working really hard to establish technical differentiation in the area of specific challenges that are relevant to getting traction. There's a lot of work ahead of us, but certainly the plans of the company are defined that way.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up, you guys talked quite a lot about 3D memory, and it seems interesting that it's finally coming to fruition at some point in the near future. What specific product lines of yours would be best impacted or best positioned when 3D NAND or even 3D DRAM happens?","Martin B. Anstice","It would appear like deposition, one, etch, two, and clean, three, in terms of the change from a percentage point of view in each of those segments. Obviously, the etch segment is the biggest segment. So the absolute dollars of change in etch may be quite similar to the absolute dollars available in terms of change in dep. But on a percentage basis, if you look to percentage dep in our planar structure to a 3D structure is the biggest proportional increase. And I've just said clean on the lower side, and the reason I said that is because until the customer attempts to yield, we're not really going to have the answer to where the value on yield-enhancing solutions is from a process flow.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Martin, going back to your NAND commentary, I'm just curious what gives you the confidence that we're going to see a kind of cycle in NAND spending that has happened many times in the past? The prices go up and your NAND customers are still [ph] spending. And I'm looking to next year, more and more of your NAND manufacturers are reallocating capital to M&A, and they seem to also be changing their strategy, different focus. So again, what gives you confidence that this time is going to be similar to what has happened in the past? And why wouldn't it be more different in the sense that more dollars of CapEx reallocated to M&A?","Martin B. Anstice","It's a tough question. I would say, first of all, I don't think anything happens kind of anytime soon. I think consistent with comments from other equipment companies, we're certainly in a lull in December and probably in a lull in March as well, and we'll see when we get to the June quarter. But relative to confidence, I don't think we have an extravagant characterization of bit growth in calendar '13. We're assuming 50%. 50% is the lowest percentage of bit growth in any of the last 4 years. That's kind of statement #1. Statement #2, at least to our analytics, there's only 20,000 wafer starts globally of unqualified, unused capacity. Unbelievably low. And so any demand that comes in is going to be a catalyst for spending. Now the spending can come in many forms, to your point. But at least to date, we have not learned anything from customers that would  cause us to model the outlook differently. Obviously, if we do and when we do, we'll share that perspective with you. And at the end of the day, the NAND investment, and like any segment, frankly, is all about demand and supply, but it's also about the availability to upgrade the existing installed base. And in calendar 2012, we probably have seen 70,000 wafer starts of new capacity added by the end of this year in support of a 65% bit growth. And we're assuming about 150,000 wafer starts of addition next year, with about 100,000 wafer starts of less conversion in '13 than occurred in '12. So that mix has the potential to change the answer to the question. We've done our best to tell you what we think the outlook is, and our best estimate is 150,000 wafer starts of addition next year and 450,000 wafer starts of conversion. And the additions will cost about $280 million, $285 million, $290 million per 10,000 wafer starts and the conversions we think cost about $50 million to $60 million per 10,000 wafer starts next year.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got it. And then one quick follow-up in terms of reporting. What would it take for you to provide some segment reporting, either revenue or revenue and profit margin profile?","Ernest E. Maddock","Mehdi, providing segment data would be particularly challenging given that so much of that is available to our competitors, and there's a general trend in the industry that, that information is not provided, and we certainly don't want to be ground breakers there. So I don't think you should anticipate a change anytime soon.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you, Britney.

With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today\u2019s call, we will share our outlook on the business environment and review our financial results for the September 2014 quarter and our outlook for the December 2014 quarter.

Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll start by commenting on our September quarter results then provide some color on our outlook for wafer fabrication equipment spending in the remainder of calendar \u201814 and discuss some trends that we consider relevant to 2015. Before transitioning the call to Doug, I will share some updates on Lam\u2019s key initiatives that we feel essential to understanding the narrative of outperformance as a major theme for Lam in 2014 and beyond.","The September quarter marked another period of strong execution for Lam. Executing on our commitments with results in line with the midpoints of our guided ranges across all metrics continued to the theme of outperformance relative to the semiconductor equipment industry with an anticipated greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth versus an industry baseline of 10% for calendar year \u201814.","Performance for Lam Research is ultimately measured by our ability to deliver value across the full community of stakeholders. At the customer interface, this value creation is focused on the leading edge where Lam is helping to solve the most critical, technical and economic challenges related to a set of technology inflections that will define the next several years of our industry, most importantly, multi- patterning, FinFET, 3D NAND and advanced packaging. It is also increasingly focused on the life time performance improvement opportunities for our customer fabs across many technology nodes. That priority is the essence of a focus in our installed base, spares and service business unit.","As discussed at our analyst investor events in July, the technology inflections for calendar \u201817 provide a $2 billion market expansion opportunity for the company and a substantial portion of our growth over the medium term is defined by our ability to succeed through these device architecture and process flow transitions. We continue to believe that our market share of the technology inflections is approximately 50% across the portfolio of deposition, etch and clean products. This strong position is particularly important when considering that roughly one-third of WFE spending in calendar \u201815 will be focused in these areas at a time when next generation technology node conversions from memory and logic are just getting underway. Notably, by calendar \u201817, we expect half of WFE spending to be in these categories, hence the conviction we have regarding the opportunity for Lam to deliver a compelling growth story as the targeted market expansion occurs.","Our objective is to realize this outperformance opportunity with a clear strategic vision, disciplined operational performance and thoughtful scaling of the company, positioning us to deliver profitable growth in line with the updated financial models shared earlier this year. At the same time, we continue to utilize the strong cash flow generated from our growth to reinvest and further strengthen our product and services portfolio, to strengthen our market position and make possible sustained performance around opportunities as they are created.","We remain committed to create value for our shareholders through this investment and also through share repurchases and dividend ongoing. As we enter the final quarter of calendar year \u201814, we expect the second half to unfold largely as we had projected with customer spending relatively balanced between the first half and second half. Spending by segment is largely tracking the projections that we shared through the year with memory slightly stronger in the first half and the second half having more broad-based logic participation.","The WFE spending environment continues to feature a healthy degree of discipline from customers and what is today consolidated industry, reflecting what we believe is a continued trend toward reduced cyclicality.","Speaking to segment trends more specifically starting with NAND flash. We continue to see a balance in overall supply and demand for bits. The majority of investments for NANDs have been for planar conversions focused below 20 nanometer. We expect installed 3D NAND wafer starts capacity to conclude this year at approximately to 60,000 wafer starts per month level and see a focus and broad participation in 3D NAND\u2019s developments and deployments at various stages in line with customer stated plans. Our outlook for 2014 NAND supply bit growth remains in the 40% range.","In DRAM, we see continued strength in investment plans from our customers with strong market demand driven largely by mobile and enterprise DRAM growth. Pricing remains stable. Investments in DRAM are primarily being made to enable the transition to the mid 2x nanometer on below nodes. These investments continue to be from our perspective very efficient, with a focus on upgrades and maximizing installed footprint capability. Projections are up for DRAM bit growth of approximately 30% this year. Overall in memory we maintain our projection for 2014 WFE at $12 billion to $13 billion.","The foundry and broader logic segments have also more or less progressed in line with our expectations. The first half of the year was focused on 20 nanometer foundry investments. The second half of the year is more weighted to early FinFET purchases with a broadening of participants and some planer technology investments by a number of customers at the 28 nanometer technology node. In summary, we see the industry largely in line with expectations and maintain our outlook for calendar \u201814 at $32 billion plus or minus 1.","As we look forward to 2015, our bias remains in favor of a growth year. While there are many factors supporting this such as publicly stated customer investment plans and nets positive macroeconomic indicators related to consumer electronic adoption trends and global GDP, it is always fair to say that much can change.","While we plan to provide more detail on the anticipated 2015 WFE spending level and composition in January, we can\u2019t say today that from industry analysis customer and peer commentary to-date at WFE growth rates in the 5% to 10% would be a reasonable starting assumption.","As always, the opportunity here is defined by the successive latest generation devices utilizing leading edge technology in the marketplace and also the ability of the ecosystem to supply these devices in a timeframe and price points that the market will sustain. We consider that our opportunity in calendar \u201815 is greater than WFE baseline due to etch and deposition markets growing faster than the average of other segments, combined with the relative strength of our product portfolio and sentiments of customer support for which we are sincerely grateful.","As mentioned at the start of my prepared remarks today, we would like to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on some of the company\u2019s strategic initiatives that have supported our growth this year and will in our opinion continue to drive our future.","The focus on solving customer\u2019s toughest problems puts a premium on commitments to significant investments in leading edge solutions and to our customer trust and collaboration level. I mentioned earlier that our execution level so far has translated into what we estimate is a market share of approximately 50% of the inflections, planning multi-patterning FinFET 3DNAND and advanced packaging for Lam Research.","With respect to overall market share, we shared with you at our SEMICON West Investor Day this year that we were performing at roughly 90% success rates for our targeted penetrations in defenses in the first half of the year. And that there were many more decisions outstanding through the end of the year.","I\u2019m very pleased to report that through a busy September quarter, we have executed well and remained at that same magnitude of customer decisions in our favor. For this reason, we maintained our conviction about the opportunity to realize our targeted market share gains, short and long-term.","From our standpoint, the commitments to investments in leading edge innovation will reinforce trust, leadership and cycles of differentiated learning for the company. We focus on technology leadership and productivity which assumes capability and cost are equally important to our customers.","One measure of our success is the milestones we are able to achieve and we\u2019ve had several of them recently. The shipments of our 4,000 deposition system from our Oregon facility, the shipment of our 2,000th VECTOR PECVD Module and our 100th 2300 Syndion Chamber shipment for Deep Silicon Etch which we announced earlier this week. The Syndion product allows for the very high aspect ratio of silicon etches essential to the production of image sensors, interposers and through-silicon vias, a market inflection just emerging.","We also expect to hit another milestone by the end of this year with the shipments of our 250th Flex FX product for memory high aspect ratio application. Our Flex systems showcase why we continue to build our market share in etch, delivering innovation and achievements with our proprietary [pulsing] technology and best-in-class uniformity tuning contributing capability to sustain our delivery of differentiated results on the wafer.","We are continuing to deliver the next generation of solutions that define the leading edge such as atomic layer deposition capability for applications such as spacer-based patterning schemes and atomic layer etch for high aspect ratio etch process steps.","These technologies have long suffered from under adoption in the industry because of productivity concerns, but Lam is now changing that paradigm with frequency of new product releases and engagements with customers that are designed to enable continued scaling for our customers.","As we move into calendar 2015, we will further emphasize by our actions the priority of staying close to our customer at a strategic and tactical level both, partnering with them on their technology introduction and ramp plans, sizing and allocating our R&D investments accordingly.","We remain highly focused on delivering sustainable growth today, efficiently scaling our business, maintaining a strong cash generation profile, and managing our balance sheet to enable execution on broader strategic goals. All of these efforts as well as our capital return programs are designed to enhance value creation for all stakeholders.","With the focus of the company as outlined, we think it is hard to find the better position semiconductor capital equipment company to capitalize on emerging industry trends. That is a byproduct of many years of hard work, continuity of leadership, strength of culture and values, clear strategic vision, and solid execution. We truly have one integrated and very capable team at Lam which is inspired to achieve more than ever and contribute to the success of our customers long-term. Let me conclude by thanking them all, the dedicated employees of Lam Research, without whom our performance would not be possible to achieve or sustain.","With that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Okay. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Before I share the results from our September quarter, I\u2019d like to pause for a moment to recognize and thank Carol Raeburn, who\u2019s done an excellent job temporarily heading our Investor Relations team, in addition to her role as Corporate Controller. Carol will be handing over responsibility for the team to Audrey Charles, who is stepping in the Senior Director of Investor Relations. Audrey has been with Lam for over 18 years and brings to the role a broad-base of experience in both customer as well as technology management. I\u2019m pleased that she will now be applying her talent and leadership to our Investor Relations team. I think you guys will enjoy getting to know Audrey.","Now on to our September quarter performance. We posted another solid quarter, delivering results at or above the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics and extending our positive momentum heading into the second half of the calendar year.","In the September quarter, shipments came in at $1,111 million, pretty much right at the midpoint of our guidance range. Relative to system shipments, systems for the foundry segment increased substantially in the September quarter accounting for 45% of system shipments and that compares to 30% in the prior quarter.","As we anticipated there was a broadening out of customer spending in the foundry space for a wide range of projects across multiple technology nodes. And I\u2019d just point out that this percentage of foundry shipments is the highest percentage for us since the March 2013 quarter.","The combined memory segment made up 44% of system shipments and this was down from 59% in the prior quarter. NAND shipments actually grew and represented 26% of the system shipments which was up from 20% in the June quarter. NAND spending reflected the continued focus on planar node technology conversions. DRAM shipments were down as we expected after the very strong levels we saw in the June quarter. DRAM shipments came in at 18% of system shipments and this was down from 39% in June. And finally, logic shipments held steady at 11% of system shipments.","September quarter revenue came in at $1,152 million and has been now running at a level of $1 billion for five consecutive quarters. Gross margin for the period came in at 45.8%, which was a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance and a little bit ahead of our near-term financial model. Our gross margin performance is determined by many factors as I\u2019ve told you before such as business volumes, product mix and customer mix. We should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter, particularly in quarters with high or low customer concentration.","Operating expenses were flattish at $321 million. SG&A declined sequentially while R&D spending increased both in absolute dollars as well as a percentage of total operating expenses. We continue to invest in R&D programs to ensure we\u2019re ready for the current as well as next set of technology inflections, which is critical to enable our revenue growth. This R&D spending is focused in areas like ALD and ALE which Martin referenced earlier.","Operating income in the September quarter was $207 million with operating margin of 18%, which again was a little above the midpoint of our guidance. The tax rate for the quarter came in at 18%, which was up sequentially due to the geographic distribution of revenue for the quarter with more revenue being generated in the United States.","For the December quarter, I would be modeling a rate in the middle teens and for the remainder of the fiscal year, I would be modeling a tax rate in the high teens. And I\u2019ll just remind you if the federal R&D tax credit were to be extended, the impact would be a reduction of a couple of percentage points on the tax rate relative to the numbers that I just referenced. Based on a non-GAAP share count of approximately 175 million shares, earnings per share for the September quarter were $0.96, which again was above the midpoint of our guided range.","Recall that with the increase in the share price, the share count now includes dilution from all three of our convertible notes offset by the impact of the note hedge that we put in place. The net dilutive impact from all three notes on a non-GAAP basis is approximately 10 million shares. And I\u2019ll remind you dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with your modeling.","We made good progress on our $1 billion capital return program. During the quarter, we spent approximately $300 million and took delivery of approximately 4 million shares at an average purchase price of $72.40. We executed these buybacks partially through open market purchases and partially through an accelerated share repurchase program, which will not close until the December quarter. On July 2nd, we paid our $0.18 per share dividend which consumed $29 million. We\u2019re pleased with the cash generation capability of the company and continue to be committed to returning a meaningful level of net cash to shareholders.","Let me now move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments including restricted cash of about $3 billion. This is down from $2.2 billion in the June quarter with cash generation in the quarter being more than offset by our ongoing share repurchase and dividend programs.","Deferred revenues were $357 million and this excludes $34 million in shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments remain as inventory on our balance sheet.","Cash from operations was $141 million, down from $246 million in the June quarter. Cash from operations was lower primarily due to the lower revenue. Additionally, we\u2019ve built some inventory in preparation for an increase in shipment output over the next couple of quarters. DSO also trended higher by 10 days due to the shipment profile in the September quarter. And finally we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 full-time employees.","Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect shipments of $1.240 billion plus or minus $50 million. We expect revenue of $1.230 billion plus or minus $50 million. We\u2019re forecasting gross margin of 45.5% plus or minus one percentage point. We forecast operating margins of 19% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally we forecast earnings per share of $1.12 plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 173 million shares.","So let me just summarize. We\u2019re pleased with our performance delivering another core of solid operational execution. It results in line to our objectives and attracting to our targets as outlined in the financial model.","With that I will conclude our prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for Martin and I to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question, I have two. Number one, Martin, when you look into 2015 it looks like you are pretty optimistic on FinFET and DRAM. I\u2019m just kind of curious, it looks like this year most of the NAND selling was on planar. Do you expect a similar trend in 2015 or do you think 3D NAND would increase as a percentage of the mix? And I also had a follow-up.","Martin Anstice","I think next year we\u2019ll continue to see planar investment levels being greater than 3D. Obviously there is a decent amount of installed base available and I think without exception today every customer is committed to scaling and committed to 3D NAND transition. And as you know there has been a various timing available from a customer. My expectation is that NAND flash investment continues to be very disciplined and in fact I would say it\u2019s probably the tightest of any of the segments in terms of the balances supply and demand next year. And I think we\u2019ll see a meaningful addition of capacity of 3D NAND, but we would still expect planar spending to be higher than 3D.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just as a follow-up, kind of curious on the status of your Single-Wafer Clean product for the front-end-of-line. Have you seen any traction or is it a product or is it a strategy you are going to pursue even on just focus on BEOL at this time? Thank you.","Martin Anstice","No, I mean the front-end-of-line is kind of largest market expansion opportunity, I mean the company is very competitive in back end of line; we have kind of great position and through the last several technology nodes we\u2019ve been very successful at defending those positions.","So the investment levels in clean and the growth opportunity in clean for sure has some back end of line growth opportunities. But in large part this is a front end of line expansion opportunity and we continue to be very engage with customers. Since the last earnings call, we have at least kind of one more engagement to my knowledge. And I would still say that\u2019s the initial revenues for kind of the new products, although there is some evidence of that today in a material context that\u2019s really still a 2015 event for the company.","And there are kind of two parts of the decision making process relative to a new product, one of them is the decisions of the company to stay committed to investments and we\u2019ve clearly performed and executed with in mind in calendar \u201814 and then ultimately set decisions by customers to adopt to technology and we\u2019re kind of in that critical phase where in many respect the decision making about the health and the direction of our clean business is more in the hands of the customers than the company.","I think we\u2019ve done what we should have done, we delivered a productive platform, we have a clear strategy around kind of difference here, the solutions offerings and it will either demonstrate differentiation of added the customer and call them to adopt our product or not. And I think the next kind of 6 to 12 months is kind of critical for the company in that regard.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. It\u2019s very helpful. Thanks Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Krish.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from C. J. Muse with ISI Group.","C. J. Muse - ISI Group","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, when you look back at or I guess we\u2019re still on 4-K. But when you think about outpacing the market, basically going two times, how do you think about the key drivers there? Is there way to rank order by end market or by FinFET or [SAPB] for DRAM in terms of what really drove that outperformance. And then as you think of 2015 and your outlook for WFE, what will be the key drivers there?","Martin Anstice","I think really kind of nothing new from the company on this point really, C. J. I mean the outperformance of the company is now kind of a two year work product. I mean we had revenue performance greater than WFE for two years in succession. And I believe we\u2019re going to enjoy the same performance benefits in calendar \u201815 and hopefully beyond. We\u2019ve got a lot of execution obviously. But certainly the set up is very healthy in that regards. And the growth opportunity is defined principally by SAM expansion by the markets of deposition and etch going faster than the average, and the multi-patterning opportunity in DRAM and logic, both the 3D NAND transition and ultimately advanced packaging are kind of the critical areas of segmentation that present that. And we\u2019re working really hard to compound that opportunity by actually executing market share growth in each of our businesses as well in the long-term and the short-term performance from my perspective makes the long-term objectives rational and credible.","So the largest opportunity in the inflection continues to be multi-patterning, second largest, 3D NANDs and both of those are heavy etch and deposition intensive process flows and device architectures. So I think the future is build upon the same outperformance elements as our recent history. And as I said in my prepared comments, the success of the company in terms of market share and positioning products and services which is kind of demonstrated outperformance in the last couple of years is kind of building momentum at the proportion of WFE spending by us as the inflections. So this year, I think the inflections see about 25% to WFE; next year we\u2019re kind of at approximately a third; and by 2017 probably 50% of WFE spending will be directly related to the inflections so providing the outperformance potential on SAM expansion and market share for the company.","C. J. Muse - ISI Group","That\u2019s very, very helpful. I guess as my second question, you basically saw pretty similar trends first half versus second half. How do you think about 2015 in linearity of spend, particularly on the foundry side given some of the commentary that it\u2019s going to be first half weighted?","Martin Anstice","Yes, the only conviction I had is there will be a first half and second half. It\u2019s really hard to answer a question like that. I mean we\u2019ve got kind of a pretty wide range on our WFE number; it feels really too early to answer that question. I do think consistent with Doug\u2019s comments on our inventory builds which you see in our balance sheet in September, we do expect a strong first half of next year and quite how strong it will be is kind of still to be determined but for sure, the visibility through the March quarter would imply that will what will be the case today. And it is really difficult when you\u2019re kind of nine months away and 12 months away to start a timing with any substance on the second half. I\u2019ll take a shot at answering that question if I may in January. ","C. J. Muse - ISI Group","Sounds good. Thanks so much.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks C.J.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Sundeep Bajikar with Jefferies.","Sundeep Bajikar - Jefferies","Hi, thanks for taking my question. First one is related to foundry. So, how much 14 nanometer capacity roughly do you think we should expect to see in the industry exiting 2015? And when do you think we start to see more optimized versions of multi-patterning and foundry? Basically something like spacer-based patterning or Intel\u2019s approach, both of which would be more deposition and etch?","Martin Anstice","Well, I think to the latter part of the question the kind of spacer-based approach is kind of definitely a trend which is accelerating. I\u2019m not going to directly answer your question in terms of capacity at the 40 nanometer nodes because frankly we don\u2019t spend a huge amount of time getting precise to one node, we\u2019re kind of grouping 20 and 16 and 14 together because to a very large extent the equipment selection for the customers are relevant for kind of all three kind of nodes or half nodes if you want to characterize it that way. But we would expect that according to the assumptions that I\u2019ve kind of given you this up 5% to 10% WFE number, we would expect that kind of the 15% ends with about 210,000 and 220,000 maybe 230,000 wafer starts per month of capacity at 14, 16 and 20.","Sundeep Bajikar - Jefferies","Great. That\u2019s extremely helpful. A quick follow-up there seems to be a lot of talk around strategic capacity expansion in semiconductor manufacturing in China. Are you starting to see this in terms of discussions around equipment purchases or do you think we\u2019re still sort of in a very early stages of planning a potential build in China?","Martin Anstice","No, I think there is actually a meaningful investment and there are kind of a number of expansion plans in China. And clearly in light of the kind of government and region specific agenda, I think everybody is developing and finessing their kind of China strategies and I would certainly say that\u2019s relevant for Lam Research as well. So, we have a very strong team, we have very closed engagement with the customers and I think we are participating well in the spending as it\u2019s going to flatten in the next year or so.","Relative to the big on unasked questions where does the government investment end up between device design, device manufacturing or even materials and equipment supply. My sense is in those four areas, there is a meaningful investment level in the device manufacturing, but I think design is going to take a lot of that money, that\u2019s my instinct today.","Sundeep Bajikar - Jefferies","Thank you very much.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Sundeep.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.","Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus","Thank you very much. Martin, maybe first off big picture in terms of a lot of the recent chatter on EUV from one of your peers. How do you see your roadmap relative to some of the comments out there? Has it changed any or do you believe that things are still on track based on a lot of the comments you\u2019ve highlighted in your previous Analyst Day?","Martin Anstice","Yes, I think our position with EUV is like almost identical today as it was at the Analyst Day. I mean the customer comments continue to reinforce; the 10-nanometer insertion is not the plan record for EUV. And I\u2019m even reading kind of custom commentary that talks about non-EUV assumptions or non-EUV possibilities for 7-nanometer logic flows as well.","Our assumption is that 7-nanometer insertion -- first of all, it\u2019s not relevant to the calendar \u201817 models of the company. So it\u2019s a \u201818 influence if at all. And we think it will be implemented with multiple patterning. And so one of the things I\u2019m struck by some of the external commentary that I read is this kind of like debate in the investment community around EUV and a very simplistic commentary on ASMI winning, Lam losing or Lam winning and ASMI losing. I think that dramatically oversimplifies things.","When we look at kind of the base EUV roadmap and the assumptions that we think are relevant in modeling, the impact of EUV on our business at the 7 nanometer technology node, we think kind of two to three passes is kind of a relevant insertion magnitude for EUV. And if you want to be more aggressive, then maybe you\u2019ll see in five or four or six or even eight. But even in that more aggressive scenario, what it does for our SAM and remember the context for our SAM. As long as there is multi-patterning, there is a SAM expansion opportunity for the company. And if you look at the 10 nanometer technology node from the material that we\u2019ve previously presented to you, there is a meaningful expansion of SAM opportunities for the company from first generation fabric FinFETs to the second 10 nanometers. And we still believe that SAM expansion go into 7 nanometer even with the aggressive adoption that we\u2019ve kind of characterized.","So, if you want to be extremely conservative about the impact of EUV on the SAM of Lam Research, you\u2019d may size the impact of couple of hundred million dollars. But it is not any more than that from the perspective that we have on insertion even with a 6 to 8 pass assumption at the 7 nanometer technology node.","Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus","Great. That\u2019s really helpful Martin. A question for Doug as my follow-up. In terms of the gross margin outlook for December, what\u2019s the key variable for your outlook there? Is it more customer concentration mix or a product mix given that the volumes obviously are higher in terms of both shipments and revenues?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, I mean it\u2019s a little bit of all of that. Customer mix actually might be the biggest one every quarter Patrick. But to the extent that things unfold the way we expect going in to this quarter through the December quarter, I feel pretty good about the 45.5 that we put out. Interestingly, if you look at the last quarter, the quarter unfolded pretty much as we expected almost to every single customer. And if that happens, I feel pretty good about that gross margin forecast.","Martin Anstice","Just to kind of add a little bit to that and this is as much as you\u2019re going to get on March. I think the deposition portfolio which has a greater magnitude in new product releases which are kind of maturing in terms of demonstrating value and also kind of cost reduction to company, definitely there is a greater proportion of deposition products in our mix in December than in September, so that\u2019s two points kind of part of the story. But the concentration of the business in December is actually not so very different from September from a customer point of view but from March it will be very concentrated. So our outlook right now for March is the top three customers will represent for us maybe kind of two-thirds of our system shipments and that compares with about the 45% level for December. So concentration of customers is definitely going to be a relevant part of our conversation in the March quarter based on what we see today.","Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus","Great. Thank you very much.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Patrick.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Mark Heller with CLSA.","Mark Heller - CLSA","Thanks for taking my question. Martin, I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color as far as the node spending trend within the 45% for foundry during the quarter, are you seeing a lot of FinFET within that and can you also give some geographic trends as far as where you\u2019re seeing spending strengths within the foundry?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, maybe I\u2019ll start and then -- this is Doug, Mark, I\u2019ll let Martin on balance. We saw decent amount across a lot of different programs, a lot of different customers, we saw spending at 28, we saw little bit of 20, and we saw some at first FinFET node, 16 FinFET. So, it was pretty broad in September and we expect that\u2019s going to continue going into December as well.","Martin Anstice","I have nothing to add. Awesome.","Mark Heller - CLSA","And maybe as my follow up, Doug then, can you maybe give us an estimate for the shipment split in December as well?","Doug Bettinger","I\u2019m not going to get into specifics; I\u2019ll give you a little color at least directional stuff. I think we\u2019re going to continue to see strong foundry shipments and I think it\u2019s going to continue to be relatively broad based. Dollar wise, probably not all that different than what we saw in the current quarter. I think memory is going to be up a little bit. And probably that\u2019s a statement more around DRAM than NAND; given how strong NAND was in the current quarter. And I\u2019m guessing or I think logic actually, not guessing, logic should be up a little bit as well. So, that\u2019s a little bit of color to think about.","Mark Heller - CLSA","Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Mark.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company","Hi guys, thanks a lot. First question Martin; I know you don\u2019t want to say too much about March. But I try to ask you this pretty much every call. So, if I look at the inventory build, it would suggest that you are planning on a shipment increase in March of somewhere in the range of maybe 10% to 15%, maybe I\u2019m not calculating that right, but I wanted to ask you that number one.","Martin Anstice","What you think my reply is going to be if you\u2019ve asked me this question before? Yes, I\u2019m not going to give that right now. We are -- I think we\u2019re looking at a strong March and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s strong if there wasn\u2019t kind of more than $100 million bucks or $150 million bucks or $200 million bucks, which is kind of the range that you are kind of talking about. But that\u2019s as good as you can get for now.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company","Okay, great. And then Doug also a question on margins. So, maybe it\u2019s sort of picking a little bit, but the guidance is a little bit below the financial model just a smidge below and that\u2019s due to the factors that you already talked about. But are those going to remain in a fact giving the concentration in March. Should we expect the margin in March to also be below financial model because of the customer concentration issues? Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Well, Tim actually 45 isn\u2019t below at least from a gross margin standpoint, the model. If you remember the \u201814, \u201815 model, 45% was the number. So, we\u2019re kind of right there. I think the directional color Martin was giving you as we expect customer concentration in the March quarter to be more concentrated and everything else equal that will be a little bit of a headwind from a margin standpoint. Having said that, if we\u2019ve got stronger top-line that should offset a little bit at the operating income line.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company","Yes. Okay, great. Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Tim.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations as well and thanks for letting me ask a question. Martin I want to go back to an answer you gave earlier around your expectations exiting next year for wafer start capacity at 2016 and \u201814. One of your peers sort of talked about a 175K number exiting this year, which relative to your \u201815 expectation would mean a lot of that spending was already done. I\u2019m wondering you could just give us your review on that 175K number or help us understand how to put your end of \u201815 into perspective for the calendar year \u201815?","Martin Anstice","Yes. Our end of \u201814 number is 130 to 140.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","That\u2019s helpful. And then\u2026","Martin Anstice","So, I mean maybe the difference is the timing of someone\u2019s order placement or its order commentary versus ship commentary, I mean we\u2019re all of that ship commentary as you know. So, hopefully that helps.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","And then relative to Doug\u2019s answer around shipment breakdown for December, is it too much to read into sort of the view that maybe the March quarter or the first half of next year going to see kind of a significant step up in memory spending? And when you look at the foundry strength in the back half of this year for you, how much of that is at the industry level versus you guys perhaps gaining some share?","Martin Anstice","Well, it\u2019s relative to kind of the foundry performance for the company. It\u2019s kind of a bit of everything. I mean it\u2019s the level of investments as 20-nanometer expansion kind of occurs as first generation FinFETs get invested and committed broadly across the industry and there is this kind of 28-nanometer kind of play as well. So we definitely get to kind of floats with the rising tide.","It\u2019s a very specific commentary from the company around SAM expansion through multi-patterning and also 3D device architecture and logic. And we\u2019ve got a little bit of a share gain in the mix as well. So, as I\u2019ve mentioned a number of times I think the primary story for the company is kind of the SAM expansion story. The market share is definitely a bonus for us, but a very important part of what we\u2019re investing to achieve. You had a second part to the question which I\u2019ve forgotten I think, sorry.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Memory trends into the first half of next year, it sounds like we can set up some pretty good memory in the first half of \u201815?","Martin Anstice","Yes, I think so. Remember we\u2019re not going to give you first half, second half specifically.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks guys.","Martin Anstice","Thanks John.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Great guys, thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. Question also on the financial model, Tim had asked about the model relative to March, I would ask about the model relative to the full year 2015. At the top end of your WFE range, assuming we come in at $32 billion this year at the top end of the guidance for next year, we\u2019d be in that $35 billion plus range. Your financial model contemplates to certain earnings number; I believe that was for 2016, 2017 at 35 billion wafer fab equipment. How different do you think your earnings might be in 2015 if we get to that $35 billion number compared to what you would have had in the model in 2016 and 2017 if you could help us out that\u2019d be great? Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yes.","Martin Anstice","Yes.","Doug Bettinger","We both could give this good effort. All I was going to say and then feel free to add on, Martin, Jim is the time component of that model as well as just the level of top-line also.","Martin Anstice","Right.","Doug Bettinger","This has maturated some new tools that gross margin gets better as we mature the product line. So there is a time component in addition to just volume, so it won\u2019t be as good where we\u2019d get that spending level earlier than the \u201816, \u201817 profile, should probably be partly in between the two models.","Martin Anstice","Yes, I mean I think in terms of the output of the company and the business done from the company, we\u2019re kind of tracking ahead of \u201814 and \u201815 kind of revenue level as many of you guys have kind of made that point. But to Doug\u2019s point, timing is a very significant part, or passing time is the very significant part of the \u201816 and \u201817 model. And it\u2019s not just about that kind of maturing products which is very important but it\u2019s about the magnitude of WFE which is an inflection, it\u2019s about the success of market share, growth plans in the company of multiple years. So, \u201816 to \u201817 really does mean \u201816 to \u201817. So my advice relative to kind of modeling \u201815 is use the \u201814, \u201815 model that we\u2019ve given you and flex it through the WFE assumption. That\u2019s what I would do. And more or less, the 25% operating expense level that\u2019s defined in \u201814 or \u201815 is a legitimate reference point for the company.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s really, really helpful. I appreciate that. And then just one follow-up, I think I know the answer to this, but I just want to make sure. Based on your comments you said for March, you would expect the book-to-bill in December to be above 1?","Martin Anstice","Yes, I would. But it doesn\u2019t trouble me, if it isn\u2019t, because the magnitude of backlog in this industry today is insanely low and it\u2019s about versatility and flexibility to respond to short term demand. So the magnitude of order placement to shipments in short order is high and these days the conversion of shipments to revenues is pretty high as well.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Very helpful. Thanks so much. Congrats.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Jim.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Martin thanks for the preliminary WFE spending outlook for next year. I know you have talked about 32% mix of inflection technologies. But can you just give us a sense on the relative contribution to the growth NAND versus DRAM versus foundry and logic next year?","Martin Anstice","Yes, I feel I\u2019m going to be pretty miserable responding to that honestly. I think I had a version of that question on the last call. And we\u2019ve kind of given you that answer for the \u201817 horizon, the \u201816, \u201817 horizon. And I\u2019ll just kind of refresh that as a reference so everybody has it. So in the context of a $2 SAM that we defined we\u2019ve kind of said that $800 million plus or minus a 100 is in the kind of foundry logic space which includes device architecture and multi-patterning. 300 plus and minus 50 is in the DRAM space which in large part is a multi-patterning. 600 plus and minus the 100 is kind of NAND in large part 3D NAND. And the advance packaging opportunity is 300 plus or minus a 100. And big part of that is obviously kind of 3D transition, three silicon via. So that\u2019s kind of the reference point.","Now what is going to be prevalent and most dominant in that context in calendar \u201815, I think the answer to that questions is multi-patterning and logic in DRAM, since that device transition, and we will see a continued deployment of 3D NANDs, but I think calendar \u201816 will be a much stronger play than \u201815 for 3D NAND HVM. I mean I think there will be a meaningful addition of 3D NAND capacity in \u201815, but I don\u2019t think it will compare to the additions in \u201816. And the advanced packaging I would say is going to show up, but it\u2019s probably again more of a \u201816 play in substance than \u201815 at this point. Hopefully that\u2019s some color that you can work with.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan","Yes, I appreciate that. What are the interesting dynamics in the memory segment and that as you transition to these inflection technology nodes, there is actually a loss of capacity, right, for fixed area floor space. So obviously this is true for the migration to the 2x nanometer node for DRAM. I think we\u2019re hearing as much as 15% capacity reduction. Are you seeing the same impact on the NAND supplier as they transition to 16 and 15 nanometer point planar technologies? And second question is are your tools and flows or how are your tools and flows helping your customers to kind of alleviate some of these capacity challenges?","Martin Anstice","Well, I definitely think that the impact on outputs for square foot of clean room in the DRAM space is a very relevant conversation and certainly to the extent there are additions of capacity forecasted assumes for DRAM next year. They don\u2019t take the baseline of available capacity up in any meaningful way for the reason that you\u2019ve just described. So, I think we\u2019ve got about 60,000 wafers our assumption for 2015 adds, but those adds just simply keep available capacity almost flat to kind of year-on-year.","In the NAND space, my instinct is the conversation is much more relevant in the planar to 3D transition that it is in kind of traditional planar scaling. I\u2019m sure there is some elements, but I haven\u2019t seen it show up permanently in conversations with the customers where it\u2019s huge customer interface is in kind of planar to 3D transition in NAND flash. That\u2019s a big one in terms of complexity of line layout and density of process chambers in a clean room.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan","Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Harlan.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS","Thanks. Hi Martin and Doug. I had a follow-up question, Martin, on the market share at the technology inflection. Do you think the market share at these technology inflections can go higher than your 50% target if there is still uncertainty between this merger, between Applied and Tokyo Electron?","Martin Anstice","Well that will be our plan. I mean we\u2019re working really hard to take advantage of every opportunity including any opportunities provided by competitors being distracted in any way shape or form. And if that distraction happens to a merger, if a merger is approved because integrating companies is not an easy skill to acquire it, it\u2019s extremely difficult. We are going to work hard to exploit every single opportunity to grow this company and that\u2019s a time expansion, Stephen and it\u2019s a market share Stephen. And then we\u2019ll see how it plays out, but that\u2019s the plan.","Stephen Chin - UBS","Okay. And then just I also have a follow-up question on the financial model. Does the model include higher shipments to a large logic customer? I was just wondering if these logic shipments start ramping into December, if that is also in this long-term model. Thanks.","Martin Anstice","All of the share gain opportunities that [Jupiter] has talked about before are comprehended in the model. Say it differently, yes.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Julian for Mahesh. Thanks for taking my questions. Martin, we appreciate that you provided color for 2015 WFE, but 5% to 10% is going to be a broad range I know you don\u2019t want to comment specifically on this at the movement, but we\u2019re wondering can you talk qualitatively, which segments are going to grow towards the higher end of the range which segments are sort of below the range just qualitatively any quote will be helpful. Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Well, I think it\u2019s kind of very similar to the answer I gave few moments ago. I think that planar scaling in NAND flash is clearly the majority of spending next year and that\u2019s a very tight specs, I mean supply and demand balance is really tight there and you can kind of see that evidence in the kind of pricing stability and the profitability levels of our customers. I think the investments in DRAM next year to a very large extent is very efficient, it\u2019s about technology conversions. There are performance benefits associated with the shrink, but there is meaningful cost benefits to the shrink. So, I think the motivation of customers to take advantage of an opportunity to invest to improve their financial performance with the cost benefits of scaling, it\u2019s clearly a very important part of their commitment. And there is a pretty aggressive raise to the FinFET foundry opportunity.","So, I mean those are the influences that I think are relevant to answering your question for the industry. For the company, our big growth trajectories are kind of multi-patterning and logic in DRAM. And 3D device architecture is very beneficial for the company and that\u2019s valid in the logic space and it will be valid in the 3D NAND space as well. But again to my earlier point, not to the extent that I expect it to be relevant as people transition, as everybody transitions, I think had a pilot into HVM in the kind of \u201816 time line.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you very much.","Carol Raeburn","We have time for two more callers. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi, thanks for taking my question. First just on the 3D NAND piece, I\u2019m wondering if you are seeing customers de-commit a little bit from what you expected earlier this year. I think previously you were looking on maybe 80,000 wafer starts, now you\u2019re talking 60,000. And earlier this year you were thinking that 2015 would be the volume ramp year. So just curious your thoughts on customer activity on 3D NAND.","Martin Anstice","Yes, I mean, I think all of our customers have kind of more or less said the same thing, right. I mean they have said they are working really hard to extend planar for as much as possible and as long as possible. But I think they are all invested in the legitimacy of a 3D NAND transition and there is kind of commitment by all of them to developments and kind of deployments.","I had expected, if I kind of look at beginning of this year, I had expected the performance and the cost benefits of 3D device to have matured sufficiently by the end of \u201814, but the kind of market dynamics accelerated the stated timelines of all four customers that have kind of engagements. And it hasn\u2019t kind of played out in quite that way. And so I think the original commentary from customers around kind of two or three year timeline difference between first adopter and kind of last adopter is probably as valid today as any reference point. So I think HVM transition is relevant in calendar \u201815, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant for everybody. So I think the HVM relevancy for everybody in 3D NAND is going to be a 2016 play.","Now all bets are off, if someone is in the marketplace with the significant performance and cost benefits and kind of deployments gets kind of pulled in which was my hypothesis before and maybe that cheers up and if it does, I think life will get pretty exciting pretty quickly.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just thinking about this a bit further. So you identified double-patterning and 3D NAND as your main SAM expansion drivers over the next couple of years. But you have also indicated that foundry spend is still fairly heavy at 20-nanometer right now and that the NAND productions are still focused planar extension. Is there some risk maybe developing around your ideas on SAM expansion in 2015?","Martin Anstice","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think we feel very comfortable with the assumption of kind of one-third of WFE being inflection based next year, I think the 28 nanometer investments is kind of supplements all and takes what already was in nodes that was in the 330,000 wafer starts per month range and makes it even a little bit bigger. It\u2019s a lot cheaper obviously for our customers to add 20-nanometer capacity than FinFET capacity. So in spite the fact that it\u2019s a decent number of wafer starts, it\u2019s kind of economic consequence is lower.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Wes.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our last question from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities","","Yes, thanks. Doug, is 50% to 60% incremental gross margin still the right way to think about the model potentially for next year in light of some of the customer concentration you expect to see in March?","Doug Bettinger","Romit, I would just redirect you back to the financial model which in \u201814, \u201815 shows 45% gross margin and roughly 20% operating income is the right way to be modeling the business next year.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities","Okay. And then just one final question on the current environment. I guess if I take the midpoint at December, it would imply that revenues for the second half of the calendar year come in about 100 million below your guidance of flat. And at the same time you seem to be more positive on March. So, I\u2019m just wondering if there was any dynamic here with the particular customer program that\u2019s influencing your guidance for December as well as how you\u2019re thinking about the March period.","Martin Anstice","Yes, with kind of due respect I went in awful of trouble last quarter to say not precisely flat. And I think a 51-49 profile which is kind of the mathematical derivative of the midpoint is pretty consistent with what I tried to position in the last earnings call. And obviously relative to kind of running the company and making choices about investments in the future, in the growth of the company and positioning to exploit SAM expansion, market opportunities as they exist. When we get these kind of ebbs and flows, and I realize the $100 million is a lot of money but when we get to these ebbs and flows, they\u2019re not actually very material to us in terms of how we think about running the company. And the difference between December and January is not worth of huge amount of anything to us, it\u2019s important to be aware of, it\u2019s important to be transparent on, our commitment to continue to try to do the best we can in that context, so.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities","Got it.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Shanye Hudson, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you, Vince. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Lam Research Corporation's quarterly conference call. With me here today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, Doug will discuss our financial results for the March 2013 quarter. Martin will then share Lam's business outlook for the June 2013 quarter before we open the call for Q&A.","The press release detailing our financial results was distributed over the wire services shortly after 1 p.m. this afternoon and is also available on our website at lamresearch.com.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements, including those related to our expectations of market size; the timing and quantity of wafer fab equipment spending; the revenue expectations of shipment to our Japanese customers; technology trends and transitions that may affect our business; market share changes; consumer demand, customer spending and behavior and the factors that will influence those expectations; our spending projections, investment plans and business focus and strategies; the positioning of Lam's products and services; the completion dates of various projects, such as our ERP integration, share repurchase activity and shipment of beta units for new products; our expectations of the benefits resulting from our Novellus acquisition; our intentions for research and development activities; our contemplated tax rate; and our forecast of cost savings, market share, shipments, revenues, expenses, margins, operating profit, earnings per share and cash generation both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis; as well as other statements of the company's expectations, beliefs and plans.","There are important factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements, and a list of these factors can be found in the slide package accompanying this conference call and on our most recent Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","All forward-looking statements are based on current information, and the company assumes no obligation to update any of them.","This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 p.m. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Doug.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Thank you, Shanye, and let me add my welcome to everyone on the call. During the short time I've been here, I've been coming up to speed on our business by having extensive one-on-ones and by attending our management meetings. I've had the opportunity to get to know something about Lam's people, processes and products, and I just thought I'd let you know that I've been very impressed with the caliber of this management team and equally impressed with the way we run the company.","For today's presentation, I'll start by reviewing our March quarter results, which will include an update on our merger-related cost synergies. I'll finish up with a few comments regarding capital deployment. And before I jump into it, I should point out that the numbers I reference today will primarily be our non-GAAP numbers.","Our March quarter results provided a solid start to the calendar year, as evidenced by performance that was above the midpoint of our expectations on most of our guided metrics. Overall, total shipments were up 12% quarter-over-quarter to $896 million. This was driven by continued strength in the foundry segment at the 28-nanometer node.","During the quarter, approximately 87% of our system shipments were for applications at the sub-4x technology node. This compares with 78% in the December quarter. At a segment level, foundry shipments accounted for 56% of the total system shipments. This is up from 51% last quarter. The memory segment made up 31%, up from the low of 20% in December. Of that 31%, NAND flash constituted 15% and DRAM was 16%. The remaining 13% was made up by logic and other shipments.","Revenue came in at $845 million, which was $15 million better than the midpoint of our guided range and down 2% sequentially. Revenue was a little stronger than we expected, driven by multiple customers in our deposition business. Gross margin was 43.9%, a little bit better than expectations and down slightly from the December quarter, which was 44.2%.","From a cost of goods sold synergy standpoint, a number of new supplier agreements took effect this quarter, and we have started to see some of those cost savings. We expect those savings to accelerate in the back half of the calendar year. And as we planned, operating expenses for the quarter were $296 million, which was up from $281 million in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we made progress toward our OpEx-related cost savings. We expect the completion of our ERP systems integration project to contribute towards achieving the remaining portion of the OpEx synergies. And I'll just let you know, system testing is well underway, and our team has done a solid job keeping the project on track to our original schedule. We expect the implementation of the newly combined system following the close of our fiscal year. And to date, we have achieved approximately half of the overall targeted cost synergies.","Now let me provide you a short commentary on 450-millimeter. Consistent with the timing of our customers' stated plans, we see our investments in 450 programs ramping in 2013. This is an area where we expect to deliver significant synergy benefits to the customer, as well as the company. We have successfully merged our engineering team activities and are executing plans to drive commonality across many aspects of our etch, deposition and strip platforms. We are closely managing our investments to meet both our customers' requirements for 450 while strengthening our competitive differentiation for the remaining 300-millimeter production nodes, which are critical to the success of our customers over the next 5 years.","I'll close out my spending discussion with the comment that we remain focused and committed to not exceeding the spending levels that we discussed during our recent Analyst Day of 305 millimeters per quarter at the $1 billion revenue run rate.","Operating income was $75 million and operating margin was 8.8%. Our tax rate for the quarter was a negative 5.6%, which was lower than we expected and down from 17.3% in the prior quarter. Our favorable tax rate this quarter is primarily attributed to the jurisdictional mix of income, as well as the extension of the federal R&D tax credit. Taxes had a positive impact on our EPS this quarter of approximately $0.02. We would expect a rate -- a tax rate for the fiscal year in the high single digits.","Based on a share count of 169 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter was $0.44. The share count includes the dilutive impact of approximately 2.7 million shares related to our 2041 convertible notes. And just a reminder about these. Whenever our average quarterly stock price is above the $35.11 conversion price, these notes have a dilutive impact. In the March quarter, our average stock price was $40.71. To help you understand the dynamic from these notes better, we've posted a dilution schedule on our Investor Relations website.","Now let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with gross cash and short-term investments, including our restricted cash, of $2.5 billion. Approximately 30% of this was onshore. This compares with gross cash of $2.7 billion at the end of the December quarter. Cash is down a bit from the prior quarter as we continued executing share repurchases and we paid our annual bonuses. And I'd just point out, cash net of debt and the restricted amounts was $1.1 billion.","DSO came in at 63 days and inventory turns were 3.7. We ended the quarter with deferred revenue of $327 million, which excludes approximately $50 million in shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters. Cash from operations was $102 million, with approximately 20% of this generated onshore.","Our cash generation this quarter was negatively impacted by those annual bonus payments I mentioned, as well as the growth in inventory to support our growing shipment plans. Company noncash expenses include, among other items, $26 million for equity comp, $45 million for amortization and $30 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $35 million, and we ended the quarter with approximately 6,500 regular full-time employees.","And finally, I wanted to provide an update on our share repurchase activity during the March quarter. We spent $214 million and took delivery of approximately 5 million shares of common stock. This substantially completes our previous $1.6 billion share repurchase authorization. Additionally, as I'm sure you saw today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $250 million, which we expect to be completed in 2014.","I just thought I'd let you know, I spent a decent amount of time working with the team looking at capital structure since I joined the company in early March. Given a largely offshore distribution of our cash, as well as cash generation, as well as the current uncertainty with regard to corporate tax reform, we believe ongoing share repurchases to be the best use of cash at this time.","I would like to tell you that we're committed to an ongoing return of excess cash to shareholders, and we will continue to evaluate the best ways to do that.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Martin for further color on the  quarter.","Martin B. Anstice","Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Before I begin, I would like to officially welcome Doug to Lam Research. As expected, Doug brings a solid financial track record and extensive leadership experience to the company. He is quickly assimilating to Lam's culture, and I'm very pleased to have him as a member of the leadership team as a true business partner. Many of you will have an opportunity to meet with him in the coming weeks and months as we plan Investor Relations activities. I'm sure you will quickly come to appreciate his strengths.","In the meantime, we've had a nice start to calendar 2013. As Doug just articulated, we delivered solid financial performance for the March quarter, meeting our expectation. We continue to position Lam products and services for market share growth. We realized incremental cost savings and remain on track for achieving our run rate synergy targets by the calendar year end. And we concluded our $1.6 billion share repurchase authorization, retiring approximately 44 million shares, faster than originally targeted, at an average price of approximately $36.","Previously, we shared an expectation for the merger to be accretive to earnings in the June quarter of this year. Worthy of note, we have delivered earlier against this objective also. March 2013 was the second straight quarter of accretion with and without the benefit of the incremental share repurchase activity. Two such data points do not guarantee all our integration objectives will be realized, but the company is truly operating as one company at the customer interface. Our ability to pursue opportunities and manage risks is undoubtedly stronger together than was true 1 year ago as 2 stand-alone companies. The ongoing and integration-related accomplishments of Lam, we believe, are significant. They reflect the substance of our vision and the talents and dedication of our employee population globally. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them all and to thank our customers and our suppliers for their continued support and partnership.","I'll now take a few minutes to share our perspective on the industry.","In many respects, things are generally playing out as expected. The trajectory of our performance is positive, supported by our shipments guidance for the June 2013 quarter given today, which will represent an activity level 34% higher than only 6 months ago. Most of that appears to be acceleration in timing of planned investments, hence, our decision to retain our outlook for 2013 WFE spending at the $30 billion level approximately.","We expect the current strengthening, which is predominantly in the memory space, to ultimately lead to a more balanced first half versus second half weighting of high 40s, low 50s, respectively, for calendar 2013.","Starting with the DRAM segment, the pricing conditions have clearly improved over the past couple of quarters, supported by healthy demand for mobile and server products. These non-PC DRAM segments account for more than 60% of overall DRAM bit consumption today. As a result of these conditions, DRAM manufacturers generally appear to be increasing the pace of their conversion plans to transition existing capacity to the 3x and 2x technology nodes, although original equipment purchases for capacity are clearly rare. We believe that DRAM capacity is reasonably fungible, meaning manufacturers can convert, relatively quickly, mobile and PC DRAM output.","We still project minimal new capacity additions this calendar year and between 450,000 and 500,000 wafer starts of capacity conversion. This activity supports overall DRAM bit growth in a range of 25% to 50%, and our analysis suggests pricing should remain healthy, with very tight supply for the foreseeable future.","Still, today, the NAND segment represents the most difficult to predict and largest swing factor of spending. But this is largely a debate about the final quarter of this year and the first quarter of next, we believe. Similar to DRAM, we're seeing a couple of NAND manufacturers pull in the timing of their next-generation investments. We continue to believe that the demand for flash memory is an attractive growth opportunity in the industry, for our customers and for Lam. We have essentially maintained our full year calendar '13 view of NAND's WFE spending at this time as we still expect manufacturers will be receiving a similar level of capacity, as anticipated in our last call.","The dominant capacity additions are playing up, but relative to 3D NANDs, we continue to project initial capacity shipments occurring towards the end of this year.","Our outlook for both foundry and logic segments has not substantively changed either. Investments for 28-nanometer capacity have been strong, and we expect that to continue over the next 1 or 2 quarters prior to decelerating and broadening the number of customers in the second half of the year. The 20-nanometer investment should commence in earnest around that same time, with an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 wafer starts of capacity shipped to our customers by the end of 2013 across the industry.","In the logic space, the second half story appears to represent a strengthening of original equipment additions, at least in our served markets, compared to the first half of the year. In this environment, Lam is executing our multiyear growth strategies in etch, deposition, clean and our installed base business. Consistent with what we shared during our recent analyst events, we are focused on aggressively defending our existing positions to realize growth potential in areas where our served markets are expanding, particularly around the so-called inflections; consistently driving incremental market share gains for the existing product portfolio; establishing opportunities to win together with our customers as productivity of an installed base becomes ever more important; and strengthening the competitive differentiation of Lam in existing served markets and leveraging into broader semiconductor capital equipment applications, such as packaging, as opportunities exist.","In 2013, we believe we gained 1 point or 2 of market share in etch, supported by the expansion of double patterning applications in the foundry space and our investments to increase differentiation around the inflections generally[ph] . We are positioned to gain a couple of points in deposition, with the initial production buys for 3D NANDs capacity occurring at the same time we enjoy a significantly expanding deposition-served market. This is being supplemented by some important wins in the packaging space and also logic or deposition. In addition, we're focused on defending our existing single-wafer clean positions to hold share relatively flat while successfully introducing our next-generation clean product, enabling more comprehensive growth opportunity for the company in the coming years.","Starting with etch. Lam has historically focused on delivering differentiated technical solutions at the leading edge. We believe this capability offers our customers a sustainable technology advantage while strengthening our ability to maintain our existing positions and grow. One example is in the area of multi-patterning. Multi-patterning applications have been in production on memory devices for a couple of generations, and Lam is the conductor etch market leader for the critical patterning steps. These critical processes require very precise and uniform control across the entire wafer to define the features. Lam's ability to precisely control critical dimensions uniformly across the wafer has enabled our leadership position. As foundry and logic manufacturers transition to the 20-nanometer node, we estimate between 5 and 15 multi-patterning steps will be required. These steps represent between $20 million and $30 million of incremental opportunity for the company per 10,000 wafer starts of capacity added.","We believe that we are well positioned for these opportunities once production buys begin later this year and anticipate that our market share in etch multi-patterning will be at least as high as our average market share position overall. Similarly, we've established strong positions in critical dielectric etch with NAND manufacturers to support developments of their 3D NAND's devices. These vertical NAND structures are built up from 24 or more layers of alternating films, which creates significant challenges for etch suppliers to deliver uniform processed results at high productivity. Lam has demonstrated the ability to address these challenges, which supports our confidence in expanding our dielectric etch share.","Now turning to the $2 billion to $2.4 billion deposition served markets, where we are -- where we currently enjoy #1 or 2 market share leadership in each segments of the business. With the transition from planar to 3D NAND devices, we estimate our served market could grow by more than 50% in that area. This is an important headline relative to future growth. Pausing for a moment, creating the complex films stacked in the 3D structure I just described requires uniform defect-free deposition also at very high productivity. The combination of Lam's multi-station sequential processing and small footprints of our PECVD toll [ph]  provide a throughput density advantage for our customers as they continue to require reductions in the overall cost of ownership.","To help optimize device power and speed, the contact and control lines require low-resistivity tungsten fill, which is free of voids. Lam is very well suited to deliver these capabilities for the challenging high-aspect ratio contact and re-interim [ph]  profiles with our extreme fill technology and film offerings.","In critical etch and deposition combined, Lam is well positioned for the transition to 3D NAND having one key development full of record precisions. Our position in 3D NAND is improved over the planar device structure in market size by between 35% and 55% and planned market share gains in the low to mid-single-digits.","We have strengthened our presence in the advanced packaging space also, having won multiple development and production decisions for through-silicon via copper Electrofill and other advanced wafer-level packaging applications.","While the market is still emerging, these wins position us well for future growth in deposition. This month, we shipped our 500 SABRE system. Our tool is widely recognized as the industry workhorse for copper Electrofill and is used by 90% of the production facilities running copper damacine processes today.","Last but not least in single-wafer clean, we continue to focus on supporting existing customers with the current product line and developing our next-generation product. We've made excellent progress to that end, demonstrating ultra-low defectivity performance in our labs necessary to meet process requirements for the 10-nanometer node. Our system is designed for lower cost of ownership by combining a high-productivity platform with advanced retained capability to reduce chemical costs. We are encouraged by the customer poll initially for our product and remain on track to begin shipping beta units in the middle of this calendar year.","Overall, our customer, company, individual core value guides us each and every day as we architect the strategies to increase our value by developing next-generation technology capabilities and productivity solutions that provide our customers with their competitive differentiation.","Related, we are pleased to have been recognized by 3 customers during the March quarter for our efforts in these areas, and for the first time in well over a decade, Lam was recognized by Intel, receiving their 2012 Achievement Award for Excellence in Technology.","Our non-GAAP guidance for the June 2013 quarter, which underpins the targeted performance communicated in our financial model at our latest analyst event, is as follows: shipments of $1,075,000,000, plus or minus $30 million; revenues of $975 million, plus or minus $30 million; gross margin at 44%, plus or minus 1%; operating profit at 13%, plus or minus 1.5%; and earnings per share of $0.70, plus or minus $0.07, based on a share count of approximately 168 million shares.","This guidance represents a 40% operating income flow-through on higher revenues sequentially at a time when we invest to support the trajectory of higher shipments and execute against our stated R&D plans of record to enable our long-term growth ambition.","Finally, I would like to communicate plans to host our 2013 Investor and Analyst event on July 9 in conjunction with the SEMICON West show in San Francisco. Although it's only a short time since our past November event, we plan on re-establishing our customary midyear communication. We expect to reiterate the stated vision objectives of the company and provide further insight into the progress we've made against key strategies we've previously described.","With that, Doug and I will now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two things. First of all, obviously, there was a pretty big memory pull-in into June. If I sort of back into what the overall WFE pull-in was using your share, it's probably like $1 billion worth of WFE. It looks like it might have pulled into June. But yet you didn't increase your full year number. Is that just due to the Intel cut? How should I think about that? And then I had a follow-up.","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I think in the context of memory, we, for sure, don't have all of the answers to the question, Tim, but there seems to be a remaining consensus around 25% to 30% bit growth for DRAM and the kind of mid-40s to high-40s level for NAND flash. And that's kind of the governing condition for capital. And so lacking any data points around a demand curve, we felt like it was appropriate for us to kind of keep the WFE number for memory essentially where it was previously. And things change and that gets stronger, then clearly, we'll revise that later. But we didn't have a basis to necessarily conclude life was going to be stronger than we previously anticipated.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it, Martin. And then just a quick question on the timing on 3D. Some of the big producers of NAND have recently said that there's not going to be meaningful 3D production for another 2 to 3 years, yet you're seeing some orders begin to happen and some production that might start to ramp the end of this year. So can you help bridge that gap? Is there just differences in timing among all the producers? Because there seems like a big difference, and it really sort of underpins some of the thoughts around just the NAND industry.","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I -- we definitely expect and I think the industry expects to receive orders and ship product into, at least, 1 3D NAND fab this year. But I think you described the situation quite accurately. There is a reasonable divergence of timing, as well as ultimately, process flow decisions for our customers. And that doesn't help any of us in terms of kind of answering some of these questions concisely. But uncertainty is there. It does appear there's a reasonable timeline difference between first adopter and last adopter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Martin, I was wondering if you could add any color at all in terms of how the profile might look like as we get past June. Your guidance obviously implies that you're thinking about a flattish shipment level in September and December that lifts up in [ph]  June. But I was wondering if we should expect some lumpiness and, perhaps, a decline in September and an increase in December as some of the foundry buying comes off and you get some other memory coming in later towards the end of the year?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I think in terms of -- yes, in terms of the specifics, obviously, we're not going to give guidance beyond the most recent quarter. But certainly, relative to the September period, you've got a nice reference point around the trajectory because the shipments guidance we've articulated is meaningfully stronger than the revenue guidance. And I do think the balance of spending in the year that you will remember from our last call was kind of -- was different than where it is today. We've seen the strengthening in DRAM in the first half and the strengthening in NAND in the first half relative to our original expectations. So our first half, second half view today is high 40s, low 50s. And I would expect the areas of spending in the remaining 28, the broadening of the foundries in the memory space and in 20, I mean, we've got pretty decent position so I think that is -- that bodes well for us and is a positive for the company in the second half. But time will tell.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And a quick follow-up I guess like you're not changing your view on wafer fab equipment spend. I was wondering if you could remind us of the controversy on this. What is your expectation in terms of wafer capacity adds, speculatively for flash, for planar and for 3D in the back half of the year? Just looking out beyond the second half of this year, do you see shelf space as a potential constraint in terms of expanding wafer capacity for NAND?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I think the answer to the last of that question is not really. I mean there's decent amount of SaaS space, whether it's in the right location at the right time, is obviously, an important question. But I don't expect there to be a clean room limitation, per se. And we're assuming in the range of 100,000 wafer starts of capacity being added this year and some part of that is kind of a very original investment, new capacity and some part of it is a transition from the DRAM space to NAND flash. If you look at the spending, so we're assuming a little more than $6 billion of spending for WFE. The additions we would estimate around the $3 billion level and the conversions we would estimate around the $3 billion level. So that's kind of a math of the data points we shared previously. I think the demand statement for NAND flash is a very positive one and certainly I would expect it to be more positive next year over this year when you look at the tablets, when you look at content, when you look at the smartphone, when you look at SSDs and the intercept points and generally assumes penetration for those products. We're going to end the year ready tight again. I mean, if these plans play out, there's not going to be whole bunch of anything sitting there waiting to be utilized and I think inventory levels generally have kind of gotten to a normalized level. So it would seem rational to conclude that spending in the NAND flash space is more likely than not and time will tell again.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Martin, I just wanted to clarify the comments you made on NAND flash 3D. I think you said previously that you expect 20,000 wafer starts at 3D capacity to be added in the back half of the year. Do you still expect that sort of magnitude of capacity added in the back half? And then, when you make your comments about OpEx for the year, do you assume Peter Wolters in that number? Or does it exclude and how should we think about that business -- I think you were looking to split that off some point this year.","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, until it's not part of the company, it's part of the guidance of the company. It's not the most material components of the financial statements so you might want to remember. So relative to -- what was the first part of the question, now it's gone?","Unknown Executive","3D NAND.","Martin B. Anstice","Sorry, 3D NAND. So I would say the 20,000 wafer starts, plus or minus, 5 is a reasonable assumption today and when we make those statements, we're talking about capacity we're shipping, right? So what form it eventually takes in terms of being available to service demand, there's a bunch of questions still remaining on that. And that's about qualification, processes, and it's about the very specific decisions of the customer that we don't clearly influence.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if you could help elaborate a little bit on the impact of double patterning expectations this year to your revenue assumption?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I mean, it's pretty important to say the least. It's one of 4 significant inflections for the company. So just to kind of refresh on that, our big focus in terms of positioning for growth in the company was around patterning around the planar the FinFET transition, the planar 3D NAND transition and through silicon via. And we believe in the transition from 28 nanometers to 20, that there's an incremental $20 million to $30 million of opportunity for the company in etch per 10,000 wafer starts. And if you skip forward 1 generation and obviously, our ability to be concrete about it is kind of limited. But we would expect that to be another kind of 30% to 40% higher than the numbers I've just kind of given you. So I think there's emerging clarity around when EUV can theoretically and practically intercept. And with a bunch of customers being out there with comments I won't supplement that today. But patterning is a very real opportunity to increase the SAM of our company and certainly, we would expect our share in those opportunities to be at least as good as the rest of our business.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then do you benefit, somewhat, from the logic transition, as well as the foundry transition this year to double patterning?","Martin B. Anstice","I would say probably not to the extent that you would like that to be true.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Perfect. And then just one more question on the 450 million millimeter impact to R&D. You maintained your OpEx cap for the year, but talked about equity investments in R&D. I just wondered if you could reconcile those 2 thoughts?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I mean, they were planned. So when we made the statements, 3 or 5 we knew what our baseline was for 450 spending and it's generally the same today as it was 6 months ago, certainly one change in either direction. I mean, the important thing about 450 is the time the investment to the expectations of customers. We don't want to be early, we don't want to be late, we want to be on time and that's a very difficult decision for the company and for anybody in the industry because practically speaking, 2018 is probably the earliest, maybe there's 2017 statement out there for somebody, but 2017, '18 is about the earliest that HVM is going to be real and so every dollar we spend in the years prior to that increases the pressure for everybody in terms of return on investment. So same assumptions today in timing from customers and therefore, same plan in OpEx for the company.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicholas.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Martin, maybe if you could comment a little bit about the foundry spend because we've heard now from TSM on their earnings about increasing their CapEx and talking about accelerating 20 nanometers. How does that impact, I guess, your shipment guide for both June and just how we look at second half of the year from that perspective?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I mean, yes, maybe I should remind everybody every time I make a statement about WFE, I did say plus or minus $2 billion when I made the statement of $30 billion and I think I repeated that in every prior call. It's tough to be super precise about these numbers. But I think $30 billion is a reasonable midpoints in all of this. As you know, TSMC has strengthened their outlook. We don't have segmentation per se in our guidance. But in the June shipments number that we've given you, we would expect that the NAND and DRAM component combined represents about 50% of system shipments and foundry represents about 40% of system shipments. So TSMC was super strong in the first half of the year at the 28 nodes as everybody knows as they talked about. And 20 becomes more important for them in the second half and there is a broadening of other foundries in at 28 and some at 20 as well. So I feel like the 30 number -- I tried to anticipate where things were going to go. It wasn't exactly mirroring the public announcements at the time we said it, but it was our best estimates and that continues to be true today.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great, now that's actually pretty helpful. Looking at the deposition market for you guys as a whole -- you mentioned the opportunities both in -- for 3D NAND and advanced packaging. Which opportunities do you see gaining traction on a high-volume manufacturing basis first on the 3D side of things or in the advanced packaging\/TSV?","Martin B. Anstice","No, I think by virtue of market size the 3D NAND is the biggest number. And frankly in any scale, it's the one that moves faster. So you should definitely process -- there are 3 or 4 catalysts for growth with our deposition products, one of them is just basic increases of competitiveness in the products, some of which come from the standalone company and some of which come as we integrate learning across the product portfolio of the company post-merger, so that's kind of one part of the story. The second part of the story is leveraging -- establish customer relationships that existed for Lam that were not quite as strong for Novellus. And by the way, there were a couple of examples of that in the other direction, so it's true for the entire business. But the biggest SAM expansion is clearly in the 3D NAND space. It's a very significant change for the industry. And our positioning in terms of DTOR [ph]  selection decisions is really quite positive. TSV is obviously, growing very quickly and is an important opportunity for us in the deposition products of the company are the ones that are most successfully penetrated in that area. Actually, one of the synergy kicks that we get us is we're kind of taking that position and trying to kind of broaden it across the portfolio of the company generally. So 3D NAND, I guess, is the simple answer to your question.","Operator","Our next question's from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Martin, can you remind us what your updated thoughts are on the WFE spend for 10,0000 wafer starts for 1Y [ph]  NAND and maybe compare that to  [indiscernible] and 3D NAND?","Martin B. Anstice","I don't think we've ever gone through that level of detail. And on the fly, I'm inclined to decline to answer your question. So if you have another question, I'm happy to take that.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Sorry, sure. Maybe let me try it this way, can you give us, maybe your thoughts on what's the CapEx for 10,000 wafer starts of NAND in 2013.","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. I mean, we have -- we got an assumption for capacity additions in the range of $350 million per 10,000 wafer starts. That's our kind of baseline for additions and we assume that conversions are in the $60 million range. Now you should kind of put a plus or minus 5 or 10 percentage points on those numbers, but that's the baseline for the company. And I believe I previously communicated that about 80% of the spending is in a planar device structure. I think holistically, I believe that, at least, 1 semiconductor company spoke to this in the last week, there are still some unanswered questions around equipment reuse in the planar to 3D transition. What is very clear to everybody is that the lithography road map gets relaxed meaningfully and the deposition road map, particularly significantly expands. So I would caution you to kind of be very clear around the headline for WFE and also the headline for the segments because the story just as is true in logic, is quite different by segments and it's very different in the NAND space and 3D NAND.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Very helpful and then just a follow-up. Question on the clean business. You have a big tool refresh coming in the second half of the front end. Is that an upside to possible share gains that, that you -- upside to your second half estimate? Or is that included in your guidance?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, it's included in the guidance to the extent it's there, but practically speaking, the release of the product in the year isn't going to impact in any material way the financial statements for the company. It takes a long time to position a product, get it qualified and get it into a high-volume manufacturing environment. It is clearly the only reason why we are able to describe a 5 to 10 percentage point market share objective for the clean business and we have a very important year this year, to demonstrate that capability to our customers in their fabs, and we're on plan to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Martin, sort of -- we've been around this issue, but maybe not addressed it directly. So you guys and ASML have pretty much articulated the 100K plus NAND wafer starts in 2013. People like Samsung and SanDisk and HInext have all said they're not going to add any wafer starts. Is that just you think those guys not going to show their hand, which I know happens sometimes? Or is there any reason for the delta there?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. I'm experienced enough to know that answering that question directly gets me into trouble. But so you got to make it what you can. I mean, we are doing the best we can to articulate the world as we see it. Which doesn't mean it's perfect, but it's the best information that we have at hand. I've been very clear and I think consistent again today that the NAND space is clearly the most difficult to predict for the reason that you've just described. And we're doing the same thing, which is to give you the best view that we can and unfortunately, the reason you get the big box is you get to triangulate around our comments.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wish. And maybe one sort of logistical thing around that. And part of this is, I know it's going to be tough to answer another part. Your industry perspective could be helpful. Somebody like an ASML where the lead times are 9 months, didn't really see a lot of NAND orders, saw very good DRAM orders and maybe part of the answer is DRAM is making up the difference. But if we didn't get a lot of lithography orders for NAND in the first half of the year and the lead times are 9 months, it's hard to understand how you could order the tools in July, get them installed by sometime in the second half and then bring that stuff up online such that you then need to order etch equipment to support that litho equipment. Is there something different about that dynamic or again, maybe part of the answer is that we should be thinking about memory as a whole and DRAM is a lot better?","Martin B. Anstice","No, I think having a conversation around NAND is just fine. I mean, I -- there's a decent component for the industry of conversions, right? I mean there's about 0.5 million wafer starts to conversion likely in NAND flash this year and that's a lot of spending, that's approximately $3 billion of spending. What is very clear to everybody is, as I just stated, the 3D components of NAND spending is going to be probably quite limited at the beginning for lithography generally because the entire scheme is more relaxed. And so the  [indiscernible]  opportunity I would imagine is quite significant. We're not the experts speaking to that, we are the experts speaking to etch, depth and clean. And certainly, I think there can be some situations where you will not see lithography spending in NAND when you do see other segments. And to be fair, I'll spin it to the other direction in logic, for example, you should expect to see some spending in the lithography space when you might not always see to the same extent spending in other segments. So the segment stories are really important this year. The 3D NAND and NAND generally is beneficial to the etch and depth space nicely and we got some really nice messages, like patterning, like TSV in the logic space as well. But in terms relative to lithography, it's tough to keep up with that success.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just want to start by congratulating and welcoming Doug to Lam. Very happy that you can make the transition from [indiscernible]. I look forward to working with you. So the first question that I have is I want to understand your perspective on progress and timing of foundries since that. Specifically I wanted to understand how the depth of your engagement with Foundry customers changes since that configuration versus the planar?","Martin B. Anstice","I'm not sure I necessarily understand everything in your question. I mean in terms of depth of engagement per se, I mean, we're as active in any device flow and structure as the customer. Its the opportunity for us in etch and depth kind of ballooning in a planar to FinFET transition logical? Answer to that question is no. I mean, there are some applications where there's maybe some increased process flow or process time. But generally speaking, the etch and the deposition spaces are reasonably agnostic to a planar to FinFET transition, obviously, some of the challenges get a lot harder like conformality and CD control and profile and high aspect ratio challenges. I mean, that's a very different game and that ultimately will influence the amount of equipment that gets purchased because process time is everything and it will ultimately influence how much we get to charge for a capability we deliver to the customer. And there's a decent set of unanswered questions in that area today. So 5% or 10% would be a baseline I will give you on our SAM expansion in the planar to FinFET.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, terrific. The second question that I had was a quick question on gross margin. We're seeing 20% shipment growth and 15% revenue growth. I would have expected gross margin fallthrough to be slightly better. I just wanted to better understand some of the puts and takes there and whether there are any special charges included in that gross margin?","Douglas R. Bettinger","Terence this, Doug. No, there are no special charges included in anything here. You have a lot of moving pieces here in terms of different product gross margin levels and you've got a lot of product mix things that go up and go down quarter-by-quarter. And that really is what you're seeing going on here. You're right, you would have expected maybe a little better gross margin everything else equal, but everything else isn't equal from a product mix standpoint.","Martin B. Anstice","I guess one of the things we would also emphasize is that the financial performance that we just guided is not so very far away from the financial model we shared from you in November of last year and certainly the commentary from the company around kind of mid-40s and ultimately when we're through kind of the synergy conversations and anything else we can figure out, maybe we even got a shot at slightly better than that. We're still a very, very, very focused on that part of running our company and we'll do our very best.","Operator","Our next question's from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I had a question, actually a follow up to the previous one. When are we going to see the tool selection for the FinFET? Is it already in place? Or taking place? And I have a follow-up.","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I think you know what the stated public timelines are from the foundries to the extent they're out there and at least one is. So you've got kind of that data points available and I do expect ramping and I think this is in the public domain from our customers as well. Their ramping expectations are faster, bigger as every node transitions. So there's a decent amount of time between a high-volume manufacturing communication and a selection. And maybe 12 months is not a bad proxy. So go take a look at the committed dates for HVM for customers and back at 12 months and that's a reasonable stake in the ground.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So the market share and who is going to claim what essentially at 2014 PR campaign, correct?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. Certainly, I mean -- it's active now, quite clearly, because...","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","The data is not going to be available until the ramp takes place and that's more like a '14 timeframe.","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, we're not going to be sitting here communicating market share changes as a result of the FinFET transition in foundries any time soon, that's a correct statement.","Mark J. Heller - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then with 3D especially with the first question, there's a lot of confusion. Does it make sense for your customers to have a pilot line, 20K and then it's going to take them some months to figure out the recipe because there are different technologies, there's an IP issue and at the end of the day, that 20 pilot line may not be producing too many NAND chips for quite some time. Isn't that a fair assessment?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I mean, there's a limit to how specific I can get because there are only -- very limited kind of customer presence in this space. But I mean, it is a very complicated technology, pilot line is an important place to validate that. But I would say, although there is clearly a lot of choices to be made in the industry on process, you can reasonably assume when we're this close to capacity hitting a fab, any customer where that's true is pretty clear what path they're on.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I see. Is it just the customers haven't shown their hands because there are few of them.","Martin B. Anstice","Well, they've shown their hands to us in terms of the engagements we have, but I'm not at liberty to describe them.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","One question on the foundry gain. Maybe I can phrase it differently. Based on the share gains and potential increase etch with double-patterning intensity, how do you think your revenue opportunity can increase from 28-nanometer to 20-nanometer and then as we get to 14-nanometer, which is Foundry has talked about a FinFET and road map. How does that benefit you in terms of revenue opportunity?","Martin B. Anstice","I think the best way to answer that question is to kind of refer back to 3 to 5-year objectives we have, because that's the timeline that's relevant to the technology nodes you just talked about from a high volume manufacturing point of view. So you can approximate a $4 billion SAM for etch and you know that we're seeking a 3 to 5 percentage point share again in that market. You know that to 2% to 2.5% is a reasonable SAM for the deposition markets that we target and you know that we're -- our objective is 5 to 10 points -- sorry, 4 to 8 points of share gain. And the single-wafer clean market is about $1.5 billion of SAM and we're targeting 5 to 10 percentage points of share gain. But because that's generally a by-product of the new product, it will tend to be biased toward the back end of the timeline, not at the beginning. So if you take those the data points, you're going to answer very, very specifically what the revenue growth opportunity is with the company and systems and then the unanswered question is what happens in the installed base and we have significant objectives in the installed base business. The company  [indiscernible] that will naturally come from broadening an install base beyond the 35,000 modules that exist today for the company. And the service offering and the productivity solutions offering of the company is something we're very focused on building and so there's a nice opportunity to supplement the system statement with customer service business as well.","Shanye Hudson","And I believe we have time for 2 more questions.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Actually, can I do my follow-up quickly. So on your [indiscernible], you talked about revenue synergy around $100 million by the end of this year from the Novellus acquisition, I was wondering if you can give us an update on that?","Martin B. Anstice","It's executing to the plan. It's only the first quarter in a 4-quarter period. So we still have work ahead of us, but I feel pretty pleased that it's executing to the plan we have.","Operator","The next question comes from line of the Ben Pang with B. Riley & Co.","Benedict Pang - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Two quick ones. First on the DRAM shipments, can you comment on what you expect for the pattern for DRAM shipment for the rest of the year? You kind of talked about the puts and takes on foundry, as well as on NAND how about DRAM?","Martin B. Anstice","So I mean, in our last earnings call, we thought DRAM WFE was going to be 50\/50 first half, second half. We would now say that 65\/35 is the better split. So it's a stronger first half than the second half. And that's all -- and obviously, that's additions and conversions combined.","Benedict Pang - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Sure. And my second question is back on NAND topic. Can you guys tell from your, I guess, systems, is there a difference in the lead time if they're requesting an etch tool for 3D NAND versus planar?","Martin B. Anstice","No.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.","Mark J. Heller - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Last, but not least. Quick question on the logic etch win that you guys were talking about last quarter. I'm just wondering, can you could give us an update on when that starts to ramp and maybe if you can give us an idea of the benefit this year in terms of revenues?","Martin B. Anstice","So I think I described it as an active production buy. So it is kind of ramping this year, consistent with that -- the selection. And in terms of the size of the opportunity, we have respected the wishes of our customer not to describe that.","Mark J. Heller - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I can follow up on the 450-millimeter spending. How should we think about that longer-term? Will Lam maintain sort of dual development platforms or a 300-millimeter platforms and 450-millimeter platforms separately and just wondering how we should think about the level of R&D spending going beyond this year and maybe the economics for the company?","Martin B. Anstice","In terms of platform architecture, I think generally speaking, the industry is going to answer that in a pretty consistent way. The opportunities that exist, the opportunity just for kind of productivity types of solutions in the 300 to 450 transition are quite different than existed in the 200 to 300. There are commonalities being designed in, in terms of fundamental technology and in the case of Lam because we have a broader product portfolio today, we're able to bring kind of, common platform, common software solutions to the products of the company, but I don't think you're going to see too many examples of bridge tools between 300 and 450 in ways that you did in the 200 and 300 transition, which means to the extent there is misalignments in the plans of our customers or even to the extent that our customers who do not transition to 450, there's a fair amount of complexity that rests on the shoulders of the equipment industry because we are likely going to have to run for multiple generations in multiple years parallel investment. Now, whether the investments of next year is any higher from this year is a question, frankly, none of us can answer right now because the specifics of plans of customers are still likely to be in flux. And we have no interest in spending money earlier than we have to. So we're going to be pretty attentive to that. And we watch this space. But frankly, we're probably going to be having this conversation for the next 5 years.","Operator","Gentlemen, that's our final question. I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any closing remarks.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you, Vince. We want to thank you today for joining us.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Shanye Hudson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you, Camille. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Lam Research Corporation's quarterly conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ernie Maddock, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Shortly, Ernie will discuss financial results for the March 2012 quarter. Martin will then share Lam's business outlook for the June 2012 quarter before opening up the call for Q&A. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed over the wire services shortly after 1 p.m. this afternoon and is also available on our website at lamresearch.com.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements, including those related to our expectations for the global macroeconomic environment of market size; wafer fab equipment spending; market share changes; consumer demand, customer spending and behavior and the factors that will influence those expectations, as well as our spending projections; our investment plans; our business strategies; our aspirations of the benefits of our planned merger with Novellus; our intentions for research and development activities; our contemplated tax rate and our forecast of market share, shipments, revenues, expenses, margins, operating profit, share repurchase activities, earnings per share and cash generation on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, as well as other statements of the company's expectations, beliefs and plans.","There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements, and a list of those factors can be found in the slide package accompanying this conference call and on our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","All forward-looking statements are based on current information, and the company assumes no obligation to update any of them. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 p.m. [Operator Instructions] ","With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Ernie.","Ernest E. Maddock","Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. The March quarter represented a solid start to the calendar year as Lam shipments, revenue, gross margin, operating margin and EPS results met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance ranges. Relative to these specifics, shipments for the quarter were approximately $713 million, up 27% from the December quarter and indicative of improving customer demand across all product lines and most notably, in the foundry space.","The breakdown by application and market segment was as follows. Applications for the 4x technology node and below represented 91% of overall system shipments, and the memory segment accounted for 40% of all systems shipments, with NAND at 30% and DRAM at 10%. Foundry accounted for 53% of overall system shipments, while logic and other constituted the balance of 7%.","March quarter revenues came in at the high end of our guidance range at $659 million, up 13% over the prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was at 40.9%, up sequentially from 40.1% and is consistent with our expectations of customer concentration and mix, offsetting improvements in factory utilization from the increased business levels.","As planned, non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter increased to approximately $197 million versus $180 million in the December quarter. More than 70% of this incremental spend was focused on next-generation R&D and the customer-facing activity that surround and support it. The balance of the operating expense change was attributable to higher variable compensation expenses associated with higher profit levels, as well as expenses related to market appreciation of deferred compensation plan assets.","Lam intends to mitigate overall exposure relative to market fluctuations impacting these plans, and this quarter is no exception. The increased operating expenses related to these plans were substantively offset by increased income in other income and expense.","As we indicated on our last call, we remain committed to keeping Lam standalone operating expenses at or below $200 million per quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $73 million versus $54 million in the December quarter and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 11.1%, slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the March quarter was 20.4% compared to 21.8% in the prior quarter.","On a Lam standalone basis, we estimate the June quarter tax rate to be in the mid-teen, bringing our fiscal year non-GAAP tax rate to around 20%. This rate would be favorably impacted by approximately 2% should Congress extend the federal R&D tax credit prior to the end of our fiscal year.","Based on a share count of approximately 121 million shares, March quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.50, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter by $0.06. Our EPS results were impacted primarily by the favorable operating results.","On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share were $0.38. The GAAP results this quarter include both acquisition and integration costs associated with the Novellus transaction, as well as costs resulting from a customer bankruptcy filing. As has been our practice, the amortization of convertible note discounts are also included. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's press release.","Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash and investments, of $2.6 billion versus $2.4 billion last quarter. During the quarter, we settled a structured share repurchase agreement and received $79 million in cash, and we also delivered cash from operations of $146 million in the March quarter versus $169 million in the December quarter.","DSO for the quarter were 65 days, down from 72 days in the prior quarter, and inventory turns of 4.2 represented an improvement from the prior quarter end performance of 3.7 turns. Our deferred revenue this quarter grew by $54 million, to end March at $246 million, excluding approximately $19 million in shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters. ","Noncash expenses include, among other items, $16 million per equity compensation and $23 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $28 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately 3,900 regular full-time employees.","In closing and similar to the December quarter, our ability to buy back shares this quarter was very limited due to restrictions relating to the pending Novellus transaction. We've repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our common stock for about $12.5 million and look forward to resuming more substantive share repurchases shortly after the May 10 Novellus shareholder vote.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Martin for his perspective on the quarter.","Martin B. Anstice","Thank you, Ernie. As we just articulated, Lam successfully delivered on its financial commitments for the March quarter. We achieved this performance while also executing key milestones towards our most important strategic objectives. ","Specifically, this includes significant momentum on the integration planning with Novellus and progress demonstrating results from continued investments designed to extend our technical differentiation and advance longer-term growth. ","The solid performance and execution, we believe, illustrate a high level of focus throughout the organization, and I would like to recognize and thank employees and the management teams of both companies for this extraordinary achievement and for laying the foundation for what we believe will be a very important year for the combined company. I will share more with you on each of these subjects shortly, but first, would like to refresh our views on the industry environments.","Our view of wafer fabrication equipment spending has not materially changed since our last earnings call. We still expect spending within a range of $30 billion to $32 billion in 2012, and based on the plans our customers are communicating to us today, we would look for spending to be relatively balanced between the first and second half of the calendar year, with less customer concentration beyond the June quarter.","Demand for leading-edge logic capacity continues to strengthen as IBM and fabless companies compete to supply power efficiency in the high performance devices for the mobile market. For the foundries, given the strong demand environments, we now project they will add between 85,000 and 90,000 new wafer starts per month of 32-, 28-nanometer capacity this year, which would translate into ending 2012 with capacity at this node of 220,000 to 240,000 wafer starts per month. ","Using 65-nanometer as a baseline, foundries will have added between 250,000 and 300,000 wafer starts per month of capacity throughout the life cycle of that node. Associated with IBM's transitioning more of their leading-edge capacity to foundries since the 45-nanometer node and the broader demand profile for consumer devices, we would expect total lifetime capacity added for the 28-nanometer node will exceed the historical range.","Turning to the DRAM segments. Our view of the demand drivers has not changed considerably. We still anticipate muted PC unit growth, reflecting the hard disk drive shortages, a cautious corporate refresh cycle and subdued content growth. Consistent with our prior commentary, DRAM, WFE spending will be comprised almost entirely from capacity conversions in 2012. ","Considering this, we would expect that bit growth for 2012 is in the lower 30% range versus our prior view of the mid to upper 30% range. Needless to say, should PC volumes expand later in the year, supply shortages will likely lead to DRAM price increases and the manufacturers will typically begin adding new capacity at that time. This could occur towards the end of the year.","For NAND, we continue to forecast bit growth in the range of 65% in 2012, with a higher proportion of capacity conversions versus new capacity additions relative to 2011. As a result, we are still projecting a modest decline in NAND's WFE spend year-over-year, which reflects our customers' plans to maintain a healthy balance of supply and demand. ","Combined, this supports a relatively stable total WFE spending outlook. This is the result of several factors, including the broadening of semiconductor demand drivers, consolidation among the customer base, cycle time improvements from the equipment companies and the prudent management to spending plans by the customer to align with the demand outlook. As a result, cycles are potentially shaped less by industry-induced supply, demand imbalances and more by changes in the macroeconomic environment and consumer confidence. ","At this point, the current economic outlook for 2013 suggests a more likely slightly positive macro environment relative to 2012, supporting the potential for stability and growth in our markets. Given that Lam's market share is relatively balanced across each of the market segments, with one exception, our continued execution would have us stand to benefit should the upside scenarios play out.","Collectively, this is positive news. However, while the top-down view of WFE spending is characterized by relative stability there's quite a bit of change going on beneath the surface. For our customers, the mounting cost challenges we've described previously are driven in large parts by the levels of device complexity required to deliver lower power, longer battery life and increased functionality demanded by the consumer markets.","For equipment suppliers, these trends present both opportunities and challenges, whereby success is predicated on the ability to partner with customers to quickly sell these increasingly complex technical and productivity challenges. Customer trust and partnership is ever more important.","As we have talked about for most of the past year, now is a critical time for us to leverage our strength in developing solutions that address our customers' most critical technical challenges. We continue to see opportunities in each of our core product areas that should position us to execute against our 3- to 5-year market share objectives of a 3 to 5 percentage point gain in etch and 5 to 10 percentage points gain in single-wafer clean. ","In etch, we have held the leading position in the conductor space for more than a decade and believe that we are well positioned for future opportunities with the expansion of patenting techniques and the transition to FinFET structures. In each of these areas, the ability to tightly control feature dimensions and depth uniformity across the wafer is crucial for device performance, and we believe Lam is currently the market leader for critical patterning, gates and isolation applications across both memory and foundry segments. ","In dielectric etch, we are focused on strengthening our product and process capabilities to expand share over the next several years. Accordingly, in memory, we continue to focus on the next generation of high aspect ratio structures. We're leveraging our demonstrated strengths to position the company for growth opportunities as NAND's manufacturers plan to transition to the 3D structures. In Foundry\/Logic, we are targeting growth in back-end-of-line interconnect applications by advancing our capabilities to deliver solutions for both performance and productivity.","In single-wafer clean, our ability to tightly control the cleaning process has led to technical differentiation in a few key application areas. As a result, we currently hold leading positions in the areas of wafer backside and bevel cleaning and the back-end-of-line. ","We are developing capabilities necessary to expand our share in the front-end-of-line by translating some of our process tuning capabilities in etch and applying them to clean processing. We're also focused on enhancing the productivity of our clean systems to more effectively compete for a broader range of applications and expect to deliver differentiated process results to support accelerated market share momentum moving through the sub-20-nanometer node. ","Our product strategy remains focused on delivering best-of-breed technology and productivity solutions to our customers. This objective is core to our market share expansion strategy. As we pursue these opportunities, we have communicated to you our commitments to keeping quarterly operating expenses below $200 million for this calendar year. We are pleased to have delivered that in the March quarter and are reiterating that commitment relative to Lam's standalone business as we move forward.","I'll share with you now our outlook for the June quarter: shipments of $725 million, plus or minus $25 million; revenues of $710 million, plus or minus $20 million; gross margin at 41.5%, plus or minus 1%; operating profit at 13.5%, plus or minus 1%; and earnings per share of $0.67, plus or minus $0.05. In anticipation of closing the transaction with Novellus, I would like to clearly state that the guidance I just provided represents projections for Lam as a standalone company. We expect to present our view for the combined company on our July conference call.","Prior to opening this call for Q&A, I will provide a brief update on the status of the Novellus acquisition. As you may have read in our proxy statements, we have scheduled our Special Shareholder Meeting for May 10, and thus far, we have received regulatory approvals from all required countries with the exception of China. We continue to expect that the acquisition will close within the June quarter. ","At this point, integration planning is well underway and is progressing as planned. We've established an integration team comprised with executives and senior level employees from both companies and supplement facts, where valuable, with experienced external resources. We have completed an assessment of each company's culture, organizational structures and business processes in detail and determined there are more similarities than differences. We have made and communicated decisions relative to these subjects through both companies already. We have defined a set of objectives around prioritized areas of focus to begin immediately on day 1 following transaction closure, and as we've discussed in the past, ensuring this transaction is seamless for our customers remains a critical priority. ","We have validated our opportunity to achieve our target of $100 million in annualized costs synergies exiting 2013, which we plan to commence at some level immediately on closing and accelerate over the 6 quarter period. Through these activities, it is fair to say we are now more confident in the strategic rationale of this transaction and the value proposition we believe it brings our customers and shareholders.","Given the expected timing for deal closure and our immediate focus on both integration and our customers, we have decided to hold our 2012 analyst event in the November time frame rather than during the SEMICON West conference this year. This move will give us the opportunity to present you a more comprehensive view of the combined company and our future growth plans. We are excited about the opportunities that this transaction presents for the combined company, and we look forward to keeping you updated over the second half of the calendar year on our progress.","I would like to express once more my tremendous satisfaction for the company's accomplishments in the March quarter, a period which included a leadership transition, the start of significant integration planning for the single largest transaction in the company's history and an ever challenging industry environment. Our performance illustrates the strength of both our employee base and leadership team, which are obviously core to our success in the years to come.","With that, Ernie and I will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Martin, a couple of questions, firstly on what's happening in terms of the June quarter shipment outlook. It seems like related to your commentary a quarter ago, perhaps the June shipments are a little bit lower than I would've expected. Could you talk a little bit about the [indiscernible] you might have seen by the right segments in June, and specifically comment whether AFP demand is temporarily affected by potential bottlenecks in lithography [indiscernible] customers?","Martin B. Anstice","I'm not sure I quite get the second part of your question, but certainly on the first part, as is always the case, the subtleties of the timing of requests by our customers, frankly, from one month to another and one week to another or one day to another is such that it's a little bit unhelpful sometimes trying to extract meaningful conclusions even from kind of quarterly progressions. And so I don't think there's a fundamental message for us to be communicating today relative to shipments momentum in the guidance that we've given for June. I do think that the shipments for Lam, certainly, as we're modeling that against the wafer fab outlook that we've communicated, we're expecting the shipments for Lam are approximately kind of equal first half and second half. And at a segment level, that would probably translate for us to have Foundry\/Logic first half maybe in the mid-50s, a 55, 45 split approximately and memory maybe slightly in the opposite directions. So 47, 48 range for first half, 52 to 53 second half. So that's about the best that I can probably give you on the shipments at this time.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And a quick follow-up you said that you're 32-nanometer, 28-nanometer capacity addition forecast by foundries has increased to 85 to 90k relative to 3 months ago. What were you thinking that they would add 3 months ago? And what exactly do you mean by modest decline in NAND CapEx. Could you quantify that?","Martin B. Anstice","I think probably about 10,000 wafer starts is the estimate I give you an answer to the foundry outlook at this point compared to 3 months ago, and I missed the second part. Satya, sorry, what was that?","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you quantify what you mean by modest decline in NAND CapEx?","Martin B. Anstice","Sure. Why don't we pick up the next question, and I'll look up that exact number for you and then, include them in the answer to the next question.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Martin, Lam -- you guys in Lam have spoiled us over the years with tremendous incremental operating leverage. You've always had the best in the industry. And there is clearly operating leverage in the model, but not at the same rate that we've seen before. Is that strictly -- could we expect that kind of operating leverage, that same incremental drop-through to return as the customer base broadens out? Or are there other factors at work?","Martin B. Anstice","So the answer to Satya's question is down about $1 million, so year-over-year that's modest statement. Relative to leverage, Jim, I think that there's clearly 2 things going on today. There's the conversation about leverage, and then, there's the conversation about customer concentration. And we worked really hard to deliver the same variability and cost structure today that we did last year, 2 years ago, 5 years ago, 10 years ago. The outsourcing initiative is still alive and well in our company. And to illustrate that point, when I look at the shipments momentum in the company, March over December, we had a pretty sizable increase in the shipments percentage of the company, and yet the underlying gross spending in the company associated with factory and field increased only by a single-digit percentage. So there's a very healthy statement of leverage in the kind of transactional base cost structure of the company. What is challenging for us and perhaps even more challenging for us in the midst of our peer equipment companies because of our kind of relative lack of position in certain segments is customer concentration. And we certainly were sitting here 3 months ago speaking to you about the fact that customer concentration was extraordinarily high in the March quarter. The outlook at that time had us conclude that by the time we got to June that would be kind of much more normalized, then we'd expect some pickup. And as I think everybody on the call knows that since that time, the public announcements that have been made by customers have actually kind of stretched the concentration into the June quarter. And that's why the message is, today what it is, I feel pretty good about the margin uptick for the company. I think when you look at kind of the sequential performance, March to June, that we've guided, the absolute dollars of revenue, that pickup is reasonable. But the headline still for the first half is customer concentration is still meaningfully above the average of last year. And when we look at the full year, I don't know that I would conclude that actually the full calendar year gets close to kind of the participation levels, broadly, that we saw in 2011. Meaning, that in spite of the fact that things get better, I don't think they get back to the same level of participation that we saw in 2011. And maybe just to frame that, our assumption on wafer fabrication equipment spending, so I kind of talked about an outlook of the year of 30 to 32. We're assuming the top 3 guys are in the $18 billion to $20 billion range combined.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question, Martin, on the shipments to memory customers in the second half, I think you said being about 55% of the total. Is that kind of based on what the NAND customers are communicating to you now? And do you think there could be upside to that based on perhaps Windows 8 and maybe ultrabook releases in the second half of the year? And then, I have a follow-up question.","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I mean, just to be sure that you interpreted the numbers I stated a little earlier correctly, and you might well have done so I apologize here. But I was saying when I gave you some numbers on first half, second half memory that we were thinking about the 47, 48 level for memory first half and second half, 52, 53 range. And clearly, the outlook for the company is based on the complete sets of investments, DRAM and NAND. When we look at the memory segments, clearly DRAM is all about conversion and upgrades, and there's very little incremental capacity this year. I think, certainly, as we look at plants today, 20,000 wafer starts of addition in DRAM would probably on the optimistic side in outlook. So clearly when it comes to capacity adds, we're making an assumption today of about 130,000 wafer starts of additions, decent amount of upgrades. And in terms of upside, I would say there are some obvious moving parts. One of them is ultrabooks. And there appears to be, as best as I can tell, some pretty helpful AFP trajectories that might be timed well to be a catalyst for ultrabook demand around kind of back-to-school season. So I think we're sitting on the 800, 900 range and may be heading down to 800, 700 as a healthy catalyst. So there's plenty of room, clearly, for ultra books for SSD broadly as a percentage of mobile devices to gain momentum. But the price point is maybe still not quite where it needs to be. So we're assuming you have to be in the kind of $100 range to be a catalyst against the hard disk in solid state drives, and we're probably at about 140 to 110 depending on whether you take a commercial view of configurations versus the consumer. I think there is some upside in DRAM, but it's kind of too early to tell, frankly. And for me, feels much more about exactly what plays out second half in the hard disk space, how that plays out and impacts content because it appears like as kind of densities in hard disks have kind of contracted to manage the supply issues that it had a content consequence on DRAM as well. And I think there's some -- perhaps it can only get better, maybe that's my summary there.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up question. Does the June shipment guidance include customer pushouts or yield issues at the 28-nanometer node? And is that something that gives you some visibility in the second half of the year once customers exceeds yield issues?","Martin B. Anstice","It's always a little hard to tell frankly, Stephen, because the customers are motivated not to make kind of yield-specific issues public as anybody. And so what we are communicating to you today is the full set of statements, the demand from customers for whatever purpose, either getting ahead of capacity needs or executing timely. I would say their motivations are today very much to add when they need it.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Martin, can you talk about your expectations for etch as a percentage of NAND WFE spending this year as you sort of think about some of the changing customer spending patterns? And also, how do you expect your performance to compare versus last year, especially now that customers -- larger customers is talking about spending less on equipment this year?","Martin B. Anstice","I think to the first part of that question, the message today is very similar to the message that we communicated in the last earnings call. We do expect this to be a better year sequentially than last year around the proportion of wafer fab that is assigned to etch. Last year was about a 12% year, and we're assuming about 13%. And that's the byproduct of a bunch of things that we've talked about previously. So that I think in relative terms is a positive for the company. To your other point, there are some customer mix dynamics that I think are kind of net positive for us this year. And I would say a point or so of momentum is certainly not unrealistic to assume, at this point, around shipments market share related to that. And I think, secondarily, there are some emerging trends and many unanswered questions around, for example, which presents, perhaps not in this calendar year but in future calendar year, some opportunities for us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first question, Martin. I'm curious on your thoughts on the breadth of foundry spending today and kind of what you expect into the second half of calendar '12. And I guess, the context of the question is QUALCOMM, post close tonight, talking about shortages that they expect through the third quarter of the calendar year at 28-nanometer, not due to yield but due to capacity shortage. So curious what kind of impact that kind of comment is having on the breadth and I guess your change in what shipments have looked like for foundry in the second half versus, I guess, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months ago.","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I mean, I think, if you're breadth question is a question related to participation in the community of guys that could be adding capacity, I think it's the very broad level of investment today. And as I said a few months ago, we're assuming kind of a 55%, 56% first half; a 45%, 44% second half in terms of spending. And it's always extremely difficult, quite frankly, to separate capacity needs from yield needs because they're kind of one and the same thing. But we are assuming for the calendar year about 125,000 wafer starts of new capacity coming in, and a big part of that obviously is 28. And we're assuming that there's pretty healthy level of conversion by customers maybe up to the 40,000 to 50,000 wafer start level. So that's kind of the outlook we have right now for foundry.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. And as my follow up, you talked about the May 10 vote. And I guess, curious, how should we think about the timing of when you can get back into the market and repurchase -- start repurchasing shares. How does that fit in with the vote?","Ernest E. Maddock","C.J., this is Ernie. Provided nothing unusual happens subsequent to the voting, by unusual I mean that if we go into the vote without China approval and it isn't obtained between the vote and 2 days after the vote, we expect to be in the market on Monday, May 14, I believe it is. If something unusual happens, i.e., China approves after the vote, it would delay it by a day or 2. But we're talking a matter of days after the vote that we would be in the market.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Martin, I wanted to question you about the cost savings you see as you integrate the 2 companies. You had a lot of time now to really continue to work on the planning on that. What are your thoughts on confidence if the $100 million number's still valid or if there's actually more savings you're discovering?","Martin B. Anstice","My confidence is pretty solid, frankly. And I mean, that's a very strong statement in the context of the reality, and the reality is we're not one company and so we still have something to learn, despite the fact that we have integration teams working together. I mean, we're certainly working through -- substantially working through concepts into very specific strategies and very detailed plans. That process will conclude in the next month or so. And certainly the areas of cost reduction that we had identified and previously communicated still appear to be valid. And until we communicate something different, then the presumption is the $100 million that we have stated is the plan and the commitment and one of confidence by the company.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question I had is related to your commentary about a very balanced year. It seems like you may be a little more positive about the second half than maybe you were on the prior earnings call. I wanted to get your feel. Have you seen -- is your confidence on the balance of the year improved since that timeframe, just to kind of get a relative comparison?","Martin B. Anstice","I think in relative terms it's actually quite similar. And I don't think there's, in the full-year, a big story. But the big customer concentration story that we're communicating today is the fact that June didn't quite play out in the way that we anticipated 3 months ago due to the announcements that we're in the public domain. They kind of prolonged the concentration message. And I think for the calendar year, the outlook today is more or less the same in terms of mix of participating customers as it was 3 months ago.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The first question is on longer-term discussions with your foundry customers. Specifically, how are your conversations with foundry customers around 20-nanometer evolving? And what's your expectation for the initial ramping of foundry 20-nanometer?","Martin B. Anstice","Relative to conversations, I'm not sure the conversations we're having are that much different than the conversations that you're probably having reading public announcements. I mean, I think certainly the big guys are communicating emerging demand for them to kind of begin to install that capacity and kind of tape outs are certainly kind of imminent. The equipment selection decisions are right on us. I mean, they're on us, some of them are behind us, and some of them are ahead of us. So there's clearly an expectation that there is some 20-nanometer qualification activities towards the back of the calendar year. And I would expect kind of production to occur in the '13 time frame. But if there is a statement of momentum, my instinct is it's a fairly positive one at this point.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. Then my follow-up question is around single-wafer clean. Single-wafer clean, in recent market share data from Gartner, was actually one of the fastest-growing areas of equipment. I wanted to understand what you feel like the dynamics are regarding competition in single-wafer clean and your margin of that business as well.","Martin B. Anstice","Well, this is one of the sad realities, is there's almost no segment -- or there is no segment in this industry which doesn't have a tough competitive dynamic, so we have tough competitive period. The rationale, obviously, for us having a plain clean is all about an adjacent strategy for the marketplace is considerably more fragmented than the etch marketplace. The competitive dynamic is tough. The growth, as you quite rightly pointed out in your question, is occurring at a pace that is faster than over all WFE growth. And that reflects to, a large extent, the transitions that have been occurring now for the last 2 or 3 years, particularly at the front end from batch- to single-wafer processing. That is a trend that is kind of reaching the end of its most obvious kind of transition. So I think maybe in the '13 or '14 timeline, we'll see a single-wafer clean segment that is much more in tune with the pace of growth as the rest of wafer fab. As I articulated in my prepared comments, I feel like we've got a very competitive product portfolio, and we have meaningful strength and presence in the backside bevel and back-end-of-line clean applications. The area of focus for us, which unfortunately coincides with significant amounts of this batch to single wafer transition, is we are addressing some gaps in terms of products capability that, I think, in the 20-nanometer or sub-20-nanometer nodes spending situations will give us a lot more upside. But front-end-of-line is clearly not the competitive strength for our company today that it needs to be, that this it isn't the competitive strength that our back-end-of-line segment in clean is.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So just to be clear in terms of your guidance between Foundry\/Logic, DRAM and NAND, how do you see those customer -- how do you see, at least sequentially, directionally they're going change going forward?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, relative to our shipment guidance, we didn't actually kind of provide a segmentation per se. But slightly more than 50% of the shipments guidance was in the foundry space. NAND is approximately at the 25% level, and DRAM is approximately at the 20% level. So that's kind of the segment story as it's reflected in the guidance today. And I think you're generally aware of kind of the recent inflection points and progressions. And clearly, the foundry is positive. Clearly, we've articulated a little bit more a cautious outlook in terms of bit growth and DRAM today than we did 3 months ago. So those were kind of 2 things I would call out in terms of changes.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And now a follow-up question on gross margins. So you articulated that it's mostly due to this high-level customer concentration, if they continue into the June quarter. I was wondering is that a way for you to kind of think about -- as we get in the second half, the concentration would be updated, do you -- how do you kind of see your gross margin can trend assuming that you're  likely running at the same amount of revenue and shipment level for the company?","Martin B. Anstice","I can see it trending up. Does that help you? There's -- clearly, I try to watch for questions like that. It's always a byproduct of specific mix in products and in customers and one of that's fraught with risk and complexity as I was speaking to. But the obvious headline, I hope, for everybody is the single biggest influence over today's margins relative to those of, let's say, last year at similar levels of output is the customer concentration. So if I were you attempting to model an answer to that question, I'd be looking at the recent past, comparing it today and extracting that. The recent past is not an unreasonable data point for the second half of the year. Now I don't think calendar '12 overcomes the customer concentration that exists in the first half. I think we'll still have customer concentration in calendar '12 that's greater than '11, and that shouldn't be as right to everybody. I think we all know what happened in that space in the industry, and it's the reality that every equipment company is now wrestling with.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Martin, just going back to memory in the second half of the year. Are your thoughts still the same as it was last quarter where the tipping point is above the big growth assumptions that you have for DRAM in the 30% -- or the mid 30% range and for NAND at 65%? If it's above that, that's when they'll start looking at added capacity? Or do you need more significant differences between those bit growth rates for new capacity addition?","Martin B. Anstice","I think, it's -- I mean, I think technically it's the same answer that I gave last quarter, although the number is slightly different. I mean, we -- I think I answered very specifically the last time. I think anything above the 40% bit growth drives capacity. I think today I'd say anything above 35% drives capacity. One of the interesting dynamics that I think we're all sensitive to is although we're looking at this thing called DRAM and saying bit growth of the 30% to 35% range, if you kind of get underneath that in each of the segments, PC DRAM bit growth this year is probably only about 15%. And then, you look at service work stations, cellphones and set-top boxes, each one of those has a bit growth expansion of more than 60, and the DRAM bit growth in tablets is above 100%, at least in terms of the modeling that we have. And so it's not going to take that much but something kind of needs to give clearly, and there's a mix of consumer dynamics with ultrabooks and a broader kind of notebook conversation. There's tablets and the broader notebook, and there's a supply uncertainty that makes it difficult to predict. But I would certainly say we would expect, based on what we know, that capacity additions occur on bit growth above or about 35%.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And maybe moving on to EUV and the potential implications for Lam as a whole, have you seen any changes in terms of your customer base in terms of qualifying additional tool sets or their changes in recipes given the delays in EUV over, say, the last 3 to 6 months?","Martin B. Anstice","No. I think we have not seen material changes because, clearly, as we've spoken to, I think, now for most of the last year, the level of uncertainty that exists not just in the area of EUV and resulting kind of patterning scheme decisions, but materials planar to 3D structures, and if you want to throw in a wafer side, throw in that as well. There's clearly a ton of uncertainty in the customers parallel processing, a whole range of things, including trying to manage the risks. They don't understand everything they need to understand on the economics of EUV compare and contrast it to what's happening and making sure they're prepared to deliver what their customers are asking for on time. So that hasn't kind of fundamentally changed in the last few months, and frankly, I don't expect it to for the rest of this year. I think that reality of uncertainty will be with us right until the end.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.","Mark Heller - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just had a question on -- looks like, at least according to Gartner, that silicon etch share, there was some share loss of there in 2011. How much of that was due to customer mix? And how much of that can be reversed, do you think, in 2012? And will it be entirely due to mix? Or will it be through share gains there?","Martin B. Anstice","We're, obviously, as I think probably we've consistently messaged in the last 5 or maybe even 10 years, we're not a big fan of trying to explain someone else's presentation of market share data because there's so much complexity with the assumptions. But as it turns out, the kind of basic headline both in relative terms, not necessarily on an absolute basis, but it comes out of Dataquest this year, is not that different from our own. To answer your question very specifically, the majority of what shows up on that slide is a byproduct of customer mix. And as spending customer mix changes, then the effect is immediate.","Mark Heller - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is -- what's your view of -- looking to 2012, but beyond just customer mix, do you expect any share gains beyond just mix effects?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I mean I have said in the prior call that we've had a great run over a 10-year period, frankly, of kind of picking up healthy chunks of market share. I think we're in a more modest year. And I still believe that the plans of record for the company targeting 3 to 5 percentage points of share gain in etch over 3 to 5 years is as valid today as it did the first time we talked about it. So we're very focused as the byproduct to the investments we're making in establishing competitive differentiation in technology turns and productivity turns. And I do expect that we will gain some share in the transition from end to end plus one.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Martin, not to harp on the customer concentration point, but just wondering if in the second half the memory guys do not come back to place orders, is it fair to assume that June customer concentration continues into the back half.","Martin B. Anstice","Well, if the customer mix in the back half of the year is the same as June, then probably yes is the answer to that. That's not what we expect. That's not what our customers are telling us. That's not what they're telling you, as best as I can tell in terms of the public announcements. But technically, if the mix in the second half of the year is the same as the mix that we see in June and the March quarter, then mathematically, it plays out in the same way. Now we're going to work our butt off dealing with cost structures, should that play out, to try and minimize the effects. But frankly, that's not what we're seeing today as an outlook.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then on the NAND side, it seems like eventually many of the NAND guys have started moving to the 3D structures. Have you guys quantified what is the incremental opportunity for you when you go into NAND for both the etch and the clean product?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. I mean, we have a view that etch and clean both stand to benefit from the transition, and that's a process time commentary, as well as a process steps commentary for 3D devices, and it's always incredibly difficult to try and speak to a consequence in terms of size of a marketplace. And the first thing that we can do, which is maybe the only thing I can speak to today, is to communicate how we believe the amount of process time will modify going from a plainar to 3D structure in NAND. And we believe that in etch and in single-wafer clean, process times could increase by 15% or so on the device integration schemes that we're working with customers on today. Now whether that translates itself into 15% increase in the TAM really is a byproduct of what happens to other segments and their process times. And it's a byproduct of the pricing on the systems that are sold to satisfy those capacity needs. But at a very basic process commentary, all things being equal, we think it's beneficial, and we think it's beneficial to the tune of about 15%.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffrey.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Two questions, Martin and Ernie. First one, this morning, ASML was very cautious on NAND spending for the remainder of 2012. Clearly, the NAND makers have had a free bit pricing environment. What gives you the conviction that NAND makers would spend in the second half? And if so, are you seeing spending by all the 4 major NAND spenders? And I have a follow-up.","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. It's a little difficult to kind of compare and contrast the commentary from one company or another because we know our own assumptions on spending. We don't necessarily know ASML's. We're confident about our own because we dialogue with customers. And the segment bit growth for cellphones is pretty solid. It's probably above 100%, and the tablet bit growth is probably about the 60% level. And you've got some nice momentum in solid state drives as well, with probably about slightly in excess of 100% bit growth in that area as well. So I think there's kind of meaningful catalysts on the demand side of the equation. And I think the technical answer to your question is everybody participating, is yes. And whether they are participating more or less than their perfect plans or their plans I think to be determined. There's a lot of unanswered questions ahead of us in terms of economics. But to your point, it's a pretty healthy pricing in the cost environment today, and people are making money and long may that continue.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","The second question is you talked about 13 application wins, I think, in your last quarter commentary. I just wanted to find out on the foundry side, how much of that would likely translate into some share -- meaningful share gains this year? Or is it likely going to be next year?","Martin B. Anstice","This year -- as I said a few moments ago, this year is a pretty kind of modest year for us in terms of share expansion. There's a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace and a lot of questions getting answered towards the back end of the year. Market share headline, for me, is very simple. We're still absolutely committed to the 3 to 5 objective for etch and the 5 to 10 objective for clean over the next 3 to 5 years. So the previously communicated objectives we still believe about it. And I think we get some modest traction on customer mix this year. But we're focused on getting differentiated more in the future than in the past and gaining share.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Pang with Caris & Company.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One on the 20-nanometer foundry applications. You commented that there's still some design wins to add. What area in terms of etch applications do you think you had the biggest opportunity in terms of incremental design wins?","Martin B. Anstice","I think by virtue of the market share strength of the company, the incremental opportunity is, no doubt, going to be in dielectric. So we're still focused on gaining share in conductor, and we're blessed at some level by the weighting of conductor against dielectric kind of biasing the natural strength of the company. But kind of back-end-of-line dielectric is clearly the focus area for the company instead of the market share expansion. And the reality is a meaningful proportion of 20-nanometer positions have been made at least in terms of their DTOR selections and how much of those selections are ultimately influenceable and the transition into a fab is anyone's guess at this point.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And my follow-up is we seem to be seeing some acceleration in the node of option for the foundries. And you had earlier commented on your run rate for your OpEx. Do you see any change beyond 2012 or fiscal '13, either way, in terms of your R&D to accommodate the fact that it looks like these foundries  are more aggressive in transitioning technology nodes?","Ernest E. Maddock","It's way too early to tell.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But what's the non-GAAP R&D for this quarter?","Ernest E. Maddock","Non-GAAP R&D? I'll have to get back to you on that, Ben.","Operator","And our final question is from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just real quickly. You gave us a 3- to 5-year share gain view for etch market share. I'm just curious. In that same time frame, what do you view the single biggest driver of an increase in etch demand in terms of new process technologies, which is [indiscernible] or FinFET or double patterning?","Martin B. Anstice","The biggest? I mean, I think the 3D scheme that we touched on at least already in terms of the VNAND structure, obviously the FinFET, has a very similar profile, honestly, of kind of process expansion in the marketplace. I'd probably pick those 2. And I think patenting generally as an opportunity for the company, given the statements that the participate in. And a large part of that particularly in the QPT space is kind of still ahead of us. So there's almost kind of nothing of substance at least in the LELE scheme today in the marketplace, so I'd pick 3D transition, frankly, as the biggest catalyst.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. By 3D are you referring to 3D NAND -- vertical NAND structures? Or are you sort of bucketing...","Martin B. Anstice","I'm referring to that, yes, yes and the plainar to FinFET transition for logic.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Lam Research quarterly conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today\u2019s call we will share our outlook on the business environment and review our financial results for the December 2014 quarter and our outlook for the March 2015 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 PM this afternoon. It can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website along with the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call.","Today\u2019s presentation and Q&A will include statements about our expectations and beliefs regarding certain future outcomes, including our outlook. A more comprehensive list of forward-looking topics that we expect to cover is shown on the slide deck accompanying my remarks.","All statements made that are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements based on current information and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.

As a reminder a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","With that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thank you, Audrey. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. We\u2019ll start by speaking to our December quarter results, supplemented by a review of calendar 2014 millstones with comments on their relevance to the future growth and opportunities for the company. We will then segue to provide an update to our outlook for wafer fab equipment spending in 2015.","Then more specific to Lam as we enter a New Year that marks the 35th anniversary of the company we want to take this opportunity to outline our focus for the year and provide some context for the multi-year out performance potential that exists as a result of the company\u2019s vision and execution. I will then hand the call over to Doug for a review of our financial and operational performance.","The December quarter concluded with results in line with our expectation showing strength across all metrics and reinforcing our outperformance trend for calendar \u201914. Within the quarter we grew our backlog by greater than 20%. Additionally, our deferred revenue balance has increased, which we expect to continue with the shipment strength anticipated in the first-half of 2015. December was the sixth consecutive quarter of greater than $1 billion in revenues and concluded a record breaking year for the company with total annual revenue reaching $4.9 billion.","Our revenue growth rates we believe outperform the industry by a factor of two with profits expansion at more than twice the pace of our revenue growth. The strong December quarter marks the end of a very rewarding year for Lam that featured the delivery of record setting performance, execution on our market share gain and SAM expansion opportunities that exceeded expectations and a high level of focus on increasing innovation in everything that we do. In turn, we believe that the differentiated culture, values and management system of the company have enabled effective scaling necessary for making profitable growth sustainable.","In 2014, we made meaningful progress against our market share targets, introducing new products and services to participate in the market expansion opportunities of the various technology inflections, including multi-patterning, FinFET, 3D NAND and advanced packaging. We believe we exited calendar 2014 with an inflection-based market share across the portfolio of deposition, etch and clean in excess of 50%, a double-digit increase compared with our total company pre-inflections baseline.","Our strong early position, combined with our unwavering commitment to customer trust and value enhancing collaboration positions us to continue to drive our theme of outperformance over the next several years. Evidenced by our relative revenue growth these last two years and further underpinned by our March quarter 2015 guidance today we accelerated our achievements towards 2017 market share targets which call for a 4% to 8% increase in deposition market share, 3 to 5 percentage points in etch and 5 to 10 percentage points in clean.","As previously shared we maintained a 90% success rate across all plans, penetrations and defenses in 2014 and as such we believe that our corporate market share has increased by 200 basis points to the 42% level in calendar year \u201814. At least as importantly we conclude that we increased our available market size from approximately 26.5% of WFE to 27.5% of WFE in 2014 through the successful introduction of new products.","We\u2019ve always judged our ability to lead and execute predictably to be one of Lam\u2019s core competitive strength. We feel that the results presented today again are evidence of very strong execution but even more noteworthy perhaps a demonstration of execution capability through a period when we are scaling the company real time, preparing for an even more exciting future.","For example last year we expanded our investments in fundamental research and C&F activities. We added a significant number of resources in the factory and in the field; we ramped all manufacturing facilities to multiple shift operations, shipped a record number of systems on-time and at quality standards that are ever more critical to our customers, all while continuing innovate at perhaps the highest level in our history, delivering more than 20 new product and service offerings to our customers.","Delivering value to all stakeholders was and continues to be a strong theme and we believe a highlight for 2014. We collaborated closely with our customers and suppliers on innovations, designed to meet the considerable technical and economic challenges of the industry. Notably we delivered products such as the VECTOR ALD Oxide deposition system targeted at extremely thin and uniform layers critical to advanced patterning and the Flex FX dielectric etch system necessary for critical high aspect ratio etch. Both products are experiencing unprecedented momentum in the marketplace. For example our VECTOR ALD Oxide system output likely comes close to tripling in calendar 2005 year-over-year, driven primarily by patterning-related application wins.","We augmented our strong earnings performance with the establishment of a $1 billion capital return program, which included the institution of our first ever quarterly dividend program. We\u2019re on track relative to our financial model and are very pleased to note that in recognition of this strong financial performance we were recently added to the NASDAQ 100 Index.","WFE investment for 2014 was largely in line with the views we expressed through the year. We estimate spending by our customers in 2014 WFE was approximately $32 billion. As we enter 2015 we maintain our outlook of a growth year for WFE investments. The predicted trends in semiconductor consumption, including demand of the leading edge and the publicly stated plans of our customers we believe support this growth outlook, but as is customary I would add that this is predicated on a positive macro environment and healthy industry fundamentals.","Our initial 2015 market outlook is as follows for the key segments starting first with memory. In the DRAM segments we see continued strength in demand and a supply constrained market entering the year. Strong market demand continues to be driven by mobile and enterprise DRAM growth, pricing remains stable. This year we see DRAM investments to be focused primarily on conversions to 20-nanometer. Projections are for DRAM bit growth of approximately 30% this year. In the NAND space we believe there will remain a healthy balance in overall supply and demand. NAND ASPs as you are aware declined somewhat over the last quarter but is generally expected to stabilize over the course of the year, reinforcements of continued spending discipline across the industry.","We anticipate that NAND WFE investment will include planar conversions and 3D NAND capacity additions in 2015 with the 3D investment being more second half weighted and for the first time the spending level more or less equal to the planar capacity components. Our outlook for 2015 NAND supply bit growth remains in the high 30's. Overall we're projecting 2015 memory WFE spending in the range of $14 billion to $15 billion.","Now turning to the Foundry segment; investments in 2015 will be focused on FinFET enablements at a number of customers and some 28 nanometer capacity additions, responding to increased demand for these devices. Our current view of foundry investment is that it will be up slightly from the healthy spending levels we saw in 2014 and again reasonably distributed across customers with consistency compared to fabless company stated growth forecasts.","We expect logic spending of $6 billion to $7 billion, more or less flat with 2014, reflecting a balanced and some slightly positive news on PC volumes and a sustained commitment to technology conversions with optimized reuse of the installed base by the customers. Overall, we are modeling 2015 WFE in the range of $34 billion plus or minus $2 billion for the year. At this point our visibility for the strong first half is better than the second as you might imagine and we believe the scenario of a relatively balanced first half and second half is not unreasonable. Of course we will know more as the year progresses and update you as appropriate.","Now turning to our goals and objectives for the business; execution and in turn sustaining outperformance remain the guiding principles for Lam in the New Year. We managed the company with a strong focus on the fundamental drivers of profitable growth, value enhancing products and services, scale and operating effectiveness. In that regard our 2015 focus is clear; differentiate on customer trust and customer experience; execute on the opportunities already won to make sustainable platform of growth; gain market share with a focus on atomic level control in deposition and etch processes; prioritize employee organization and business systems development to enable efficient scaling; and deliver profitability requires to fund growth.","Putting the $2 billion market expansion opportunity, we described previously in context, LAM's standalone etch and clean product portfolio competed for 19% of WFE. Subsequent to the addition of the deposition portfolio we competed for 25% of WFE at the date of the Lam- Novellus merger closing. On the three year anniversary of announcing that deal we have a product portfolio that will compete for approximately 28.5% of WFE in 2015 and we believe by 2017 greater than 30%. The significant market expansion, combined with accelerated market share gains in applications critical to the inflections demonstrate what we consider very good progress with exciting upside.","Before handing the call to Doug I would like to express my genuine appreciation for the recognition Lam has received for our hard work and achievements over the last year. Lam was recognized for its leadership and collaboration by multiple stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, investors, industry analysts and peers. This recognition serves as a powerful affirmation and acknowledgements for the 6,900 Lam employees who unite around the objectives of the organization to make all of this possible.","On behalf of the entire Lam team I would like to express our appreciation for the support and opportunity given us in 2014. We look forward to sharing our performance against our goals and opportunities with you again this year. Doug?","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. As Martin mentioned in his opening comments calendar \u201814 was a year of fundamental outperformance for Lam Research. The focus on market share gains and product positioning to take advantage of SAM expansion, combined with strong execution I think was clearly demonstrated in our financial results. We delivered record levels of shipments and revenue. We grew revenue at more than double the rate of WFE growth and we grew operating income at more than double the rate of that revenue growth.","We generated $942 million in operating income for the year, which represented nearly 20% of revenue and we returned approximately $486 million to our shareholders through the initiation of our first dividend and our continued share repurchases.","Specific to the December quarter shipments, revenue and gross margin were in-line with the midpoint of our guidance and earnings per share were at the high end of our range. In the December quarter shipments came in at $1.247 billion, which was up 12% sequentially. The combined memory segment made up 53% of total system shipments and this was up from 44% in the prior quarter. DRAM shipments were strong and contributed 43% of system shipments, which was up from 18% in the prior quarter. DRAM investments continue to be heavily focused at the 20 nanometer node.","NAND represented 10% of shipments and this was down from 26% during the September quarter. The Foundry segment remained steady in the December quarter, accounting for 32% of system shipments versus 45% in the September quarter. Foundry shipments were relatively broad based with investment for sub 20 nanometer FinFET being completed by 28 nanometer outlays.","The Logic segment grew and made up 15% of system shipments, and this was up from 11% in the prior period. We delivered $1.232 billion in revenue in the December quarter. Revenue increased 7% from the prior quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter with revenue above the $1 billion mark.","Gross margin for the period came in at 45.4%, essentially at the midpoint of our guidance and pretty consistent with our near-term financial model. And as I previously mentioned you should expect some quarter-to-quarter variability in gross margin due to a number of factors such as product mix and customer concentration. I think our financial model remains the best way to think about our ongoing financial performance.","Operating expenses increased to $330 million but actually decreased as a percent of revenue compared to the September quarter. SG&A was flattish while R&D spending for items such as engineering program and associated materials for our next generation products increased. We continue to make the strategic investment necessary to successfully position the company for sustainable growth and will adjust our plans based on our ongoing assessment of these opportunities.","Operating income in the December quarter was $230 million with operating margin of 18.7%, which was 30 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance. The tax rate for the quarter came in at 9%, and that compares to 18% last quarter. The December tax rate benefited from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in the United States as well as a more favorable jurisdictional mix of income. A tax rate in the middle teens would be reasonable for you to include in your forward-looking models. Based on a share count of 174 shares earnings per share for the quarter were $1.19, and this was at the high end of our guidance primarily due to that favorable tax rate.","I would like to remind you that the share count includes dilution from all three of our convertible notes at this point. The net dilutive impact is 12 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. With the first of our convertible notes maturing in 2016 and given the current favorable interest rate environment we will be evaluating our alternatives to refinance this note. Dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 converts are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference","In the December quarter we spent about $46 million and took delivery of approximately 590,000 shares at an average price of roughly $77. We also took delivery of 278,000 shares from the accelerated share repurchase that we executed during September quarter. And we made pretty good progress on the $850 million share repurchase authorization that we announced in April 2014 with greater than 40% of it completed during the first eight months. And finally we've returned $0.18 per share in dividend distributions to our shareholders.","Let me switch gears now and move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short term investments, including our restricted cash of $3 billion which was about flat compared to the September quarter. Cash generation was partly offset by those capital return programs as well as capital expenditures. Cash from operations was $161 million, which was up from $141 million in the September quarter. With the increase in shipments account receivables and day sales outstanding grew slightly. We also saw growth in inventory to support the levels of shipments expected in the next couple of quarters, and I just mentioned that I expect the linearity of the March quarter to be even a little bit more back end loaded, and therefore expect to see a little bit of lengthening in accounts receivables and DSO.","We exited the quarter with deferred revenue of $374 million and this excludes $53 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments remain as inventory on our balance sheet. Company non-cash expenses include $31 million for equity comp, $40 million for amortization and $30 million for depreciation. We incurred $61 million for capital expenditures in the quarter. CapEx was up in the quarter as we increased our investments in lab and new product development capability. We exited the quarter with approximately 6,900 regular full-time employees. This growth of roughly 300 employees comes from supporting new customer sites, higher manufacturing volumes as well as increases in new product group development activities.","So now looking ahead I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the March quarter. We're expecting shipments of $1.450 billion plus or minus $50 million. We're expecting revenue of $1.370 billion plus or minus $50 million. We're expecting gross margin of 44%, plus or minus one percentage point. We\u2019re forecasting operating margins of 19% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally we forecast earnings per share of $1.30 plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 174 million shares.","And I\u2019ll just remind you that as we mentioned during the September quarter call, the March quarter is impacted by both a mix towards more new tools, that haven't fully moved on the cost curve yet as well as a heavier customer concentration. These items are contributing to the lower gross margin percentage. I expect this to continue to and extend in the June quarter but I anticipate improvement in the gross margin percentage in the second half of the year. The right way to think about our financial performance over the medium and longer-term remains our published financial models.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And at this time we'll take the question from C. J. Muse, Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","C. J. Muse","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess first question, was hoping to get some clarity from you on directionality, I guess the shipments just going into Q2 and the second half. Last quarter you talked about an uplift a quarter out, curious if you could provide some color on that front and what the key moving parts are and assumptions?","Martin Anstice","I guess the answer to that question is once bitten twice shy. I think one reason I did share perspective today CJ around kind of backlog is I think it should kind of tell you something about the trajectory of the company and the industry spending kind of out, that we have but I am going to kind of avoid a level of specificity at this point in time for the June quarter.","I do think and I think I mentioned in this in my prepared comments that the outlook for the first half is reasonably clear to us and pretty strong and there is still a lots of months left in the year for us to get really specific about the second-half. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable seeing we haven\u2019t a short reasonable [ph] balance this year.","C. J. Muse","Okay, and I guess as a quick follow-up, Doug can - you talked a little bit about the up lift in OpEx, came in a little bit higher in the December quarter and then relative to the guide you know roughly $8 million to $10 million higher as well. So just curious are these one-off programs associated with specific customers or is this a slightly new trend line that we should be thinking about going forward?","Doug Bettinger","No, I mean the right way to think about, kind of our levels of spending are what we perceived to be our sustainable level of profitability. Yeah, we were a little bit below that operating income but I don\u2019t think 30 basis points is too much. We are ramping up some of our R&D activity as I kind of indicated in my prepared remarks which is part of what you are seeing go on in the March quarter. But the right way to think about how we intend to spend money will be to be roughly consistent with financial models that we put out. And right now we do have a little bit of gross margin headwind that I described but the spending level is still pretty well within those models.","Martin Anstice","I think as just to add, I think Doug\u2019s prepared comments that kind of describes the addition of headcount, also need to be put in context. And so I don\u2019t spend a huge amount of time talking about this because I think across the industry it\u2019s not a very easily comparable benchmark but for the company a revenue per employee trajectory is not an unreasonable reference for you to be thinking about. And in fact through the December quarter and the March guidance that we have given today, the revenue per employee is getting better not worse.","So I mean I think the context for spending more money is the growth of the company is pretty significant and our focus as a leadership team is making sure we are effective doing that, before we start worrying about efficiency, which doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t try to do both. But the customer trust exposure for getting a ramp wrong is not a risk we are biased to take - we are biased to get this effective so that we can kind of really, really kind of deliver sustainability for the story that we are telling here today.","C. J. Muse","Very helpful, thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks, CJ.","Operator","At this time we will take a question from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.","James Covello","Great, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congratulations on the good results. Obviously you guys don\u2019t talk about orders on the call but the shipments going up quite a bit would suggest order activity overall is healthy over the last couple of quarters. Can you talk about any pushes or pulls in order activity overall, obviously your guidance for shipments is a little bit stronger. Is there any movement within that one way or other in the various sub-segments?","Martin Anstice","Thanks Jim for your comments at the beginning. I don\u2019t think that this anything new for us to communicate. I think the industry generally saw a little bit of a push on some foundry investments, saw a little bit of a pull on some DRAM investments and the rest of the industry more or less kind of played out in the way we had expected. I do think it is a little bit more concentrated shipment number for us from a customer perspective then even we were anticipating in the October timeframe relative to March \u201915. But I think those messages are messages that are well communicated right now by the rest of the industry.","James Covello","That\u2019s very helpful. And I mean I guess it\u2019s always hard to distil the industry down, there a couple of things alone that we should be looking for, but is it fair to say that your memory margins are probably going to dictate, if we do get that balanced half on half, if memory margins stay high we would expect continued investments in that segment but if there was any deterioration there we would run the risk that the back half is a little softer. Is that one key thing that you would be looking at?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I think sustained discipline is something we continue to see, is something we continue to hear from the customers and it\u2019s something we continue to expect. But I think kind of history tells us if this gets ahead of itself in a significant way then there is always, at a minimum some kind of pause. Where, we don\u2019t expect that, we expect continued discipline in every segment of the industry and we kind of come into the year pretty tight almost everywhere. And from, as best I can tell, the inventory levels and the industry commentary are, from our customers on inventory kind of supports continued discipline that I think at some level is a byproduct of a consolidated industry.","James Covello","Very helpful. Thanks a lot and good luck.","Martin Anstice","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","And at this time will take a question from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Martin, first in terms of overall memory spending in the year, do you see it biased first half versus second half in terms of DRAM, maybe potential be more first half weighted while you see DRAM flash more second half weighted or do you see kind of a balanced spending across both segments throughout the year?","Martin Anstice","So I kind of have two answers to your question. One of them is kind of from the bottoms up forecasting and planning, which is always a little bit limited, when you start kind of focusing on something six months from now and nine months from now but our bottoms up analytics would tend to support what you just described, which is a slightly stronger first half for DRAM and a slightly stronger second half for NAND. But frankly when is all is said and done here I think we're likely to see a little bit of strengthening in the second half but time will tell, that may play out, it may not play out but the basic premise that you just described.","And I guess the only other thing I'd supplement with is perhaps compared to the commentary from the company three months ago, where we articulated we expected planar spending in NAND flash to exceed 3D. We're kind of making the statement today that as best we can tell it looks more likely to be equal and the planar investment in NAND flash is biased the first half and the 3D investments in NAND flash is biased the second half.","Patrick Ho","Great, that's really helpful. Maybe and my follow-up question, more for you Doug in terms of just kind of OpEx levels and how we look at the longer term business model. One of the areas you talked about at your Analyst Day was building out your installed base business and the services front. With IOT kind of gaining momentum a lot more verbiage out there, how do you see, I guess your growth in terms of that business segment and in terms of the OpEx that maybe needed to support the growth over the next few years.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah, you may remember Patrick we talked about or I tried to talk about our objective with the installed base business is to grow at faster than the new equipment market, right. So there was a graph where I showed that. Consistent with that we are growing a little bit of spending in that business group this year over and above what was there last year to go try and take advantage of those opportunities. So that is part of the investments when I talk about opportunities that are out there. We do believe we see opportunities to generate returns and the spending is up there a little bit.","Patrick Ho","Great. Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Patrick.","Operator","At this time we'll take the question from Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company.","Timothy Arcuri","Hi, guys, thanks. I jumped on here a little bit late, but my first question is around the inventory. Doug if I look at, just look at days, days are up to like 125 and I am wondering if that portends some view on June. I know you don't want to say too much about June, but I am wondering if that portends some view that maybe June shipments are going to be up?","Doug Bettinger","Yeah, I am not going to give you kind of what June looks like. I did describe purposely in my prepared remarks that we expect shipments to be strong in the next couple quarter, without giving you a direction from March to June. And we've built inventory in anticipation of that. So you should expect that those inventory levels come down in the back half of the year likely, but expect us to update that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, Tim.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, and then I just had two more quick ones. First of all Doug, just can you give us some sense of what you think the mix will be for shipments in March and then I wanted to know also, if all things equal, so let's just say shipments were flat in June, I just wanted to try to isolate the customer concentration issue that's bringing down margins in June. Would margins come right back up to the model in March, would margins come right back up to the model in June, absent this customer concentration issue. Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah, so I think directionally in the March quarter, memory shipments are going to be up as a percent, logic is probably flattish, maybe down a little bit and I think foundry will be down a little bit, when you put all that together and by the way those are system shipments. I kind of indicated, I think the customer concentration piece continues into the June quarter a little bit and then my expectation is in the back half of the year the gross margins move backup from where they are. It\u2019s hard to call things move around Tim, as you know in this business. But as we sit here today I think we are going to continue to see some concentration in June, might be a little bit less than it is in March but this stuff moves around quite a bit.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks so much.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Tim.","Operator","At this time we will take a question from a Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin","Thanks, hi Martin and Doug, nice results last year too. I had a follow-up question on the 3D NAND spend in the second half of the year. Just curious if you think the spend on 3D NAND in the second half will be mostly driven by one customer, or you think it\u2019s equally spread across the customer base? It\u2019s been a long time since we have seen any meaningful 3D shipments too, I guess or starting [ph] customers, just curious on the diversity you are looking at?","Martin Anstice","I would say there is clearly an expectation that one of the customers, well publicized is kind of in the lead from kind of an investment timing perspective. But we expect this year to have kind of a diverse spending and anticipate all four NAND flash memory companies participating in a meaningful way. So I expect the spending to be more distributed in \u201815 than it was in \u201814 and just to kind of give you a little bit of a number on capacity we expect to be shipped in. So I think in the last call I mentioned that we were thinking that we ended the calendar \u201814 year with approximately 60,000 wafer start, 65,000 wafer start, of shipped-in capacity 3D NAND. And as best we can tell that more or less kind of played out as anticipated and we think by the end of \u201815 that 130,000 wafer starts plus or minus 10 is not a bad kind of reference point to have.","Stephen Chin","Okay, thanks for sharing those numbers. So it sounds like if Lam were to outgrow WFE again this year, it sounds like 3D NAND spend in the industry is strong in the second half of the year. That\u2019s probably one of the main ways that you outgrow the industry this year, does that - seems like that\u2019s one of the messages?","Martin Anstice","Well from an inflection point of view the 3D NAND inflection is not insignificant, as we\u2019ve talked about before and from a timing point of view it plays a pretty meaningful role in the year-over-year comparison. But that\u2019s also true by the way for the multi-patterning transition as well. I would say the only inflection that doesn\u2019t kind of really get traction of substance to have kind of a material impact on the kind of outperforming characteristics of the company is advanced packaging, which isn\u2019t to say there isn\u2019t a positive story, because I actually think that the advanced packaging revenues of the company have [indiscernible] kind of doubling year-over-year but the scale of that compared to multi-patterning and then the 3D NAND transition is kind of obviously very different and meaningfully lower.","So yeah, I think our performance is a commentary on the 3D NAND and FinFET and multi-patterning transitions in DRAM and logic both, and it is a commentary on market share momentum in the company which we are, I think accelerated, it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s slowing or stagnating, it feels to me like the market share momentum is actually accelerating. This is kind of something we\u2019ll work very hard to sustain.","Stephen Chin","Thanks, Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Operator","At this we will take a question from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Weston Twigg","Hi, just wanted to follow-up on the last comment related to DRAM multi-patterning as being one of the drivers. Wondering as the industry works through the 20-nanometer conversions and add the additional etch tools for multi-patterning, is there some risk to etch intensity for DRAM in the following years as they kind of - as maybe the incremental etch opportunity slows down given that they would have more etch tools for use?","Martin Anstice","I think the reality is that even after the investment that we\u2019ve described in calendar \u201815 and our best estimate is approximately 400, maybe 400 to 440 or 410 to 430, hard to be specific at this point, is the kind of 1,000 wafer start conversion, approximately of the industry. There is much more than that at the end of calendar \u201915, still in need of conversion to the 20 nanometer technology node.","So to the extent there is a risk in the form that you are describing it I don't think it shows up in calendar '16. It has the shortest showing up in calendar '17 but a lot is going to change between now and '17 relative to the roadmap of DRAM. So it's not something that's a particularly prominent kind a risk factor for us in the scheme of things.","Weston Twigg","Okay so in other words the same drivers that you see today, the 3-D NAND, FinFET, the DRAM multi-patterning, you expect those to be pretty consistently strong over the next two years?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I mean I think the context to one of the earlier questions is the discipline and the balance, the supply and demand balance, but we had a number of years to demonstrate the performance on that. So I think we're getting to a point where trusting that is the legitimate assumption it is much more balanced.","Weston Twigg","Great. Thank you very much.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Operator","At this time we'll take a question from Sundeep Bajikar with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sundeep Bajikar","Hi guys thanks for taking my question. First just following up your comments on heavier mix of new tools expected in the first half, can you say which end market these new tools are targeting?","Doug Bettinger","Martin referred to 20 new tool introduction last year, I mean it's that. So it's obviously broad based. If I had to give you a little bit of color it's probably more biased towards our deposition product group then it is the etch product group in terms of new tools that are coming out, given some of these inflections that are happening there is a little bit more going on there.","Sundeep Bajikar","Okay great. And then a quick follow-up on foundry. Are you continuing to see activity in the 14 nanometer node, and how much 14 nanometer capacity do you expect to see exiting the year?","Martin Anstice","So the answer to the first part of that is yes. And I said before we are not kind of distinguishing the 14, 16 capacity additions from the \u201820 because there are so much of an overlap of the equipment portfolio, 90% to 95% of the equipment is kind of in a track [ph] from the last planar node to the first FinFET node anyway. So our assumption is that we exit 2015 with somewhere between 200,000 and 220,000 wafer starts of combined capacity 2016 and '14.","Sundeep Bajikar","Thank you so much.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Sundeep.","Operator","And at this time we'll go to Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar","Yeah, hi thanks for taking my question. And thanks for the color on the SAM and share gains that you guys highlighted for last year. Two quick questions, first one, Martin in the past you\u2019ve spoken about a third of the WFE spending this year might be for tech inflection. Curious if that is still the view or do you think that would change given the challenges people are having at FinFET and 3D NAND? I also have had follow-up after that.","Martin Anstice","No, I don't think there is a fundamental challenge. Instead of maybe 33, maybe we end up saying it\u2019s 31 or something like that, or 32 is the byproduct of the 3D NAND kind of assumption set, kind of delaying from '14 to '15 a little. But the fundamental message, I think is exactly same today as it was before and the kind of end gains to the extent we are describing one of calendar '17, the 50% kind of spending proportion on the inflection is still the assumption we're running with.","Krish Sankar","Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick question for Doug. What is your mix of on-shore versus offshore tax and what do you think is the right amount of cash to run the business? Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Krish, it's somewhere between 20% to 25% onshore, as we sit here today and obviously then 75% to 80% offshore. And as always we're thinking through how to fund that $1 billion capital return program and I previously said we can fund that with the cash that we have in that program. I think it's a pretty significant program in terms of returning cash. And once we get through the current authorization you will hear us talk about what are our plans as we go forward. So pretty comfortable with the level of cash. It's been pretty flat in gross terms over the last couple of quarters and that's because we've been returning cash to shareholders.","Krish Sankar","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah, thanks Krish.","Operator","And at this time we'll take a question from Mark Heller with CLSA Equity Research.","Mark Heller","Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the strong results. Martin I was just wondering if you could update us on the DRAM, the outlook for the DRAM sector in terms of new capacity additions this year. I think previously you were talking about maybe 50,000 to 60,000 starts. I am just wondering if that\u2019s still the case for this year.","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I think maybe we would probably say more 60 than 50, but I think a number of customer have said most recently as well that addition frankly does not do more than keep the available output kind of constant because in the technology transitions from the 3x range to the mid-20 and to 20 there is kind of loss per kind of square foot of clean room in terms of output. So the assumptions that we are making is the investments of 60,000 wafer stocks or so is maybe it\u2019s a little higher, maybe it\u2019s 60-70, that range but it\u2019s not a 100,000 wafer stocks of additional or anything like that. It essentially kind of keeps the output potential constant year-over-year.","Mark Heller","Got it. And then it looks like the shipments to Korea picked-up quite a bit during the quarter. I am just wondering if that\u2019s more weighted to foundry or memory spending. Thanks.","Martin Anstice","In the interest of not being specific to any one customer we are going to kind of elect not to answer that question directly please.","Mark Heller","Thanks.","Martin Anstice","But Mark you can just listen to what I said in my prepared remarks and kind of get some level of indication from there.","Operator","At this time we will take a question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.","Sidney Ho","Thanks for taking my question. So a question on the foundry. I think I know you talked about visibility in the first half is good. How\u2019s your visibility in the second-half? And if a customer decides to go with FinFET this fall do you think there is enough capacity to handle that right now or do you think more equipment needs to be ordered from here?","Martin Anstice","Well, that\u2019s a little hard to answer without kind of getting into a lot of details in terms of a demand statement for those devices. I guess the headline for us is we kind of trust the substance of communication from the customer. I think everybody is saying that in the interest of keeping everything in balance and so what we are communicating is our best understanding of their investment plans, which as I said it\u2019s in the kind of 200,000 to 220,000 wafer starts installed capacity by the end of this calendar year for 2016 and \u201814 combined. So. If the customer is underestimating the demand for that device then I think there will need to be more investment. It doesn\u2019t show to me like there is risk, that they are over investing it. I think it\u2019s pretty reasonable commentary on outlook as best we can tell.","Sidney Ho","Okay, and a follow-up, maybe this one is for Doug, you talked about the customer concentration in Q1. Does it happen every Q1, is that - it just happened that the stars are aligned this quarter, or you think it\u2019s a byproduct of a more concentrated customer base?","Martin Anstice","I don\u2019t know if there is seasonable profile to it per se, Sidney. I mean this is more concentrated then I can recall seeing it in the two years I have been with the company. So I think this is over and above where you would normally expect it to be.","Sidney Ho","Okay, great. Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks, Sidney.","Operator","At this time we will take a question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad","Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on a great quarter. Martin, one question on the 2015 WFE, at the last quarter earnings call you had indicated WFE to be up 5% to 10%. Now it seems you are indicating it up flat to up 13%. Just wanted to understand why you are broadening the range? What are some of the factors that have kind of increased the variability in 2015?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I don\u2019t know that I kind of read too much into it. I mean I think kind of our headline is the outlook that we described in percentages three months ago is not so far away from the outlook we are describing for dollars. And it\u2019s kind of pretty customary for the company to start the year with a plus or minus $2 billion and it\u2019s kind of out in the middle of the year now in that range to plus or minus a $ 1 billion. So we\u2019ve just kind of done our best to translate the outlook of three months into a customary form of guidance I think what has changed is from the kind of public disclosure of the customer, some kind of foundry spending expansion and kind of DRAM more less the way it was and commentary from the micro-processor space of the importance of reusing their overall strategies. But the 34 plus or minus two is just a commentary on we\u2019re at the beginning of the year and lots can change and we are doing our best to tell you what we think the range is.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it, thank you. And then one question on NAND. You mentioned the spending on the planar versus PD should be about balanced this year. I wanted to ask about the planar spending this year. How much of the capacity do you think will go through a planar node transition this year?","Martin Anstice","Again, I've come to appreciate that, that level of specificity gets a little bit close to the sensitive disclosure of the customers, given there are only so many. So if you may allow me I'm going to kind of defer that question to our customers.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. Thank you. That's all I have.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Operator","At this time we'll take a question from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats for a great quarter. So first on the SAM expansion commentary, Martin you had - that you believed your SAM would expand about 30% of WFE by 2018. I guess two parts question, first is how much are you baking in, help [ph] greenfield 3D NAND investment versus converting excess planar to 3D? And the second part to it is does that factor in some kind of adoption of EUV?","Martin Anstice","Well, first of all we said 2017, not '18 relative to last part of your question, EUV we don't believe has any relevance of substance in 2017 timeframe by virtue of the stated plans of the customer not to have an EUV kind of adoption until kind of the 7 nanometer technology node at the earliest. And I think we kind of gave you some color on that the last quarter. Relative to 30% as being a legitimate target for our company, from a proportion of WFE, that's available to us, there of course is some assumption associated with how the customer builds 3D NAND capacity, but we are not assuming a very grand, I would say conversion of kind of the planar installed base that sits at more than a million wafer starts from their capacity today.","So and I think there is a lot of learning still in the industry to kind of know quite what 3D devices get targeted to in terms of end markets and how fast that conversion will play out. But we haven't kind of - we haven't assumed a grand conversion of the installed base. We're trying to estimate as best as we can an efficient way for the customer to establish that capacity. So we tend to bias a conversion assumption rather than an addition assumption for the industry generally, but as you know every customer is slightly different relative to answering that question and there are some that are very focused on addition, and there are others that are very focused on conversion.","Unidentified Analyst","Great that's very helpful. And then just quickly touch on the clean side, you guys have a new product, just any kind of update on how that's coming along. And as that product assuming that's still later year part of this year which I think was your target right, where do we expect first initial adoption, is it foundry DRAM or NAND?","Martin Anstice","So, frankly three months is a really short term period of time in the context of kind of new products and new markets. And I don\u2019t have so much more to say than I did - today than I did in October and maybe the one exception is for the kind of new product, the ES [ph] product we have had kind of repeat order of the penetrations that we made for one customer which is, I think, a meaningful statement of validation, but it isn\u2019t everything we need and so what we need is kind of an industry, to kind of make that choice as well as a couple of customers and this is the year where I think the decisions of the customers will define the legitimacy of this strategy and plans of the company.","I think the company has done a really good job in delivering the productivity differentiation and getting us process capability for a front end of line clean growth opportunity. But just because the company does, it doesn't mean the customers are going to be invested in that selection of that adoption and we're doing our best and as you said this is the year that it kind of really plays out one way or the other.","Audrey Charles","Okay, operator we have time for two more questions today.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Thank you very much. I had a question on the foundry commentary you made that spending is up flat to up slightly. TSMC guided for 20% increase in CapEx. So I'm assuming other customers are probably reducing the spending. Can you talk about where the cut is coming from, is that other customers, is it in the FinFET area or they\u2019re reducing the investment in mature technologies?","Martin Anstice","I don\u2019t know that I can easily answer that question. I mean we are assuming that all of the foundry customers are making investments in this calendar year and we\u2019re assuming that at least two-thirds of the wafer starts in the industry are getting added at the 14, 16-nanometer technology node. And as you\u2019ve heard from two of those customers I think the 28-nanometer demand is not insignificant. So that\u2019s kind of in the mix as well.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Okay, so my follow-up I just want to revisit the financial model you presented at Analyst Day mostly in terms of revenues at $32 billion, you were targeting 5.1. I think that was probably towards the end of 2015 and I don\u2019t think we have the right number - we don\u2019t have the precise number for 34. So according to that model where will you be at $34 billion revenue?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Mahesh I am not going to give you a new model, as I sit here right now but I will give you a little color around it. The one thing to think about is there is a level of WFE context in the model. There is also a time component to the model right, because there is a maturation of some of these new tools that are coming out. Both of those items are very important to the attainment of the financial model and if you recall we kind of showed a $5.6 billion, \u201816-17 model that got a percentage point better than the \u201814-\u201815 model and we are probably somewhere in between each of that once we get through some of these tool maturations but we need the time to get through those.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Mahesh.","Operator","Our final question will be from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes, thanks for squeezing me. Martin, going back to your DRAM bit commentary, what are the key assumptions for that 30% bit growth and I say that because earlier this morning Hynix talked about 25%. I think Micron is also talking about 25% bit growth. So I am just trying to better understand the underlying assumption in your view? And I have a follow-up.","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I mean the assumption is when we kind of add up the collective disclosure from customers and kind of what\u2019s available to us kind of, from being kind of inside of the industry and participating kind of real time, that\u2019s the best assumption we can give you.","Mehdi Hosseini","Okay, and then for the purpose of modeling, Doug how should I think about working capital requirement, how does the inventory changes from the December into the March quarter?","Doug Bettinger","Yeah, just the fact that the denominator goes up even if inventory is flattish, which it probably is going to be. You will have inventory turns and days come down. Directionally inventory is going to trend down, I think as we go through the year, as we\u2019ve built into this level of shipments. So a little bit of color for you to think about as you model it.","Mehdi Hosseini","Okay, thank you.","Audrey Charles","Operator, I think actually we have time for a couple more.","Operator","Okay, thank you. At this time we\u2019ll move to Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.","Atif Malik","Hi, thanks for taking my question. On the $34 billion WFE outlook, Martin can you talk about the swing factor that can take it to $36 billion or the high end of the range? Which segment can take it to that range\u2026?","Martin Anstice","Yes I guess anyone can in theory. I think the 3D NAND conversion is more likely to influence in a positive direction than anything and that\u2019s really a statement on the size of that transition and the implications of it and obviously the degree of uncertainty that exists in terms of kind of market penetration of that device at this time. So I do think kind of FinFET conversions can accelerate, if there is kind of momentum that it is in excess of stated plans in terms of going from planer to a FinFET device, but it feels to me like the upside is kind of greater in memory than foundry logic and greater in NAND than DRAM. But I guess in theory all of them can move in a positive direction.","Atif Malik","Got it. And then on the timing of EUV insertion, one of the foundries has taken a pilot production, little tools [ph] and just curious if anything has changed to your thinking in terms of different node\u2026","Martin Anstice","Yeah, nothing really. I mean we\u2019re still thinking 7-nanometer as kind of the earliest and the only thing that I read in the last kind of three months kind of reinforced the complexity of the infrastructure around the EUV process itself as being kind of significant component of that question. And it didn\u2019t look like it got any easier, it looked like it got more difficult as best I could tell. Okay, Harlan you are up.","Thanks Atif. Harlan you are the last guy today. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The final question will be from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Bill Peterson","Yes, hi, this is Bill Peterson calling on behalf of Harlan. Thanks for sneaking me in and congrats on a good December quarter. I want to clarify a few things relative to your commentary on logic, you mentioned about re-using. In fact to understand what will be different in logic relative to the foundries and the nature of that, some logic customers are already at FinFET and a lot of foundries are not, if you could provide some color on that, that would be very useful, thanks.","Martin Anstice","You know, I think really it\u2019s kind of the age old, relative ease and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy but in relative terms it probably is, you know with the amount of kind of die concentration that exists in the microprocessor fab compared to the distributed die and customer reality of the Foundry, the conversion cycle really kind of is a big challenge. And so I think that\u2019s kind of principle reason that there is an emerging trend of some substance to conversion in foundry but it does not compare to what is available to the microprocessor world.","Bill Peterson","So in terms of implications is that there should be more and more upgrade or what does it mean in terms of how do we think about it for implications for Lam and other equipment vendors?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I think it can be, when people do conversions, it can be upgrades from a hardware perspective and sometimes it is nothing because they find a way to make the hardware work and there is a process modification and you know with rare exception this industry doesn\u2019t get paid very much for process. It gets paid for the hardware that gets sold into a fab even though perhaps the value contributions in that is really made is the process contribution but that\u2019s a long story.","Audrey Charles","Great. All right, thank you operator. That\u2019s all we have time for today. Thank you for your participation and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Operator","Once again this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation."],"13480":["Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) Q1 2013 Earnings Call October 23, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Shanye Hudson - Director of Investor Relations","Douglas R.

[Operator Instructions] And with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Martin.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As you may have read in our press release today, September 2013 marked the highest revenue quarter in the company's history, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. We grew operating margins by nearly 200 basis points, sequentially, demonstrating a strong execution throughout the company. Additionally, we've made progress towards our strategic growth objectives, winning key production tool decisions across various technology inflections and shipping new products, including our next-generation clean system and latest 3D NAND etch capability into leading-edge customer engagements.","Overall, the quarter was more than satisfactory and reinforced the substance of our vision objectives and our strategies and capabilities to execute. The September quarter marked the close of an important transition period for the company as we successfully concluded our major integration activities.","Singularly focused, we now present one face to our customers for all products and services, and we enjoy the full complement of a well-aligned employee population. Aligned, not just to our business objectives and plans, but to our stated culture and values. Related, I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every employee for their contribution to these outstanding accomplishments, which would not have been possible without their hard work and dedication.","As stated previously, I regard acquisition integration capabilities at Lam as a competitive differentiator within our industry. The aspiration to be the most collaborative semiconductor equipment company grows in our consciousness as we look forward to planning our actions in calendar 2014.","Turning now to the industry environment. As we enter the final months of the calendar year, we are able to narrow our 2013 wafer fabrication equipment spend forecast to $29 billion, plus or minus $1 billion. This outlook is largely consistent with our views throughout 2013, though there are some well-publicized moving pieces that I'll highlight for you now.","Starting with the Logic segment. We now project WFE spends close to $6 billion for the year, slightly lower than our prior view, as certain customers have been able to reuse more of their existing equipment to support their leading-edge production needs.","In Foundry, at least one customer has started to ramp 20-nanometer capacity and the pace of those investments has accelerated in the second half of this year. We still expect overall foundry spending around $12 billion, albeit with slightly less trailing-edge investments than previously expected. We see healthy demand and a positive profit and spending trajectory from memory customers and maintain our WFE forecast of approximately $11 billion for that segment for the calendar year. NAND manufacturers are making the transition to the 20-nanometer technology nodes and below for planar devices, and consistent with our expectations, total shipments for the first phase of 3D NAND's production are beginning, as we speak, and extend into the first half of 2014. Depending on qualification and time to yield this capacity, we assume, would likely begin contributing to NAND's bit supply in the mid-2014 timeframe.","Overall, we project bit growth in the mid-40% range for 2013, with relatively stable supply and demand balance headed into 2014. In DRAM, contract ASPs have surged by 10% to 20% over the past month driven by tight supply conditions. Due to the well-known short-term supply chain disruption, we've lowered our estimates for 2013, bit supply growth by a couple of points to the mid-20% range and expect a balance between supply and demand to remain extremely tight and disciplined through 2014.","Over the past couple years, WFE spend has been driven primarily by mobile electronics. Media tablets have grown at a compound annual rate of greater than 130% since 2010, and we expect smartphones will represent about half of total cellphone units this year versus around 20% in 2010. While annual unit growth rates for tablets and smartphones are intuitively starting to decelerate, off the much lighter base, continued demand and density expansion for mobile products supports our preliminary view for 2014 wafer fabrication equipment spending to be in the range of $32 billion, plus or minus $2 billion, assuming a flattish GDP. Actual spending levels are likely to vary, of course, around customers' investment supporting technology inflections, and in the coming months, we expect customers will continue fine-tuning their plans and outlook. We will share more information as this becomes available.","It has been nearly 1 year since we introduced our growth strategy for the broadened and newly formed Lam Research. This strategy is founded on market expansion and share gain opportunities derived, in large parts, from technology inflections, such as multiple patenting, 3D device transitions and advanced packaging. Having completed our merger integration slightly ahead of schedule, we are now singularly focused on executing against those strategic growth objectives. We shared with you, previously, our view of success relative to the transition from planar to 3D NAND. While we continue to work hard strengthening competitive differentiation and protecting positions established, we can report today that we are pleased by the initial production tool decisions.","In etch, we sustained strong and above our overall average market share, securing critical dielectric high aspect ratio applications. We expect our new capacity addition, served available market, or SAM, to expand by 30% to 40% over the planar baseline.","In the deposition segments in which we compete, we believe our new capacity addition, SAM, grows by 60% or 70% compared to the planar baseline. Further, we believe we've made sizable share gains, winning critical applications in both CVD and tungsten CVD. Our focus over the next 12 to 24 months is on achieving a similar outcome with each of the remaining NAND manufactures, as and when they transition to 3D device structures, in high volume manufacturing. Overall, we estimate it will cost more to add new 3D NAND capacity versus the same amount spent on equivalent wafer starts in that final planar generation. Based on our market size and market share expectations for high volume manufacturing when 3D NANDs become mainstream, we believe that Lam's stands to realize more than 1\/3 of the transition opportunity, representing incremental revenues in etch and deposition combined, of approximately $25 million per 10,000 wafer starts at capacity added, or more than 60% market share on the incremental SAM.","Equally important are the production tool decisions for the foundry, 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer technology node. Compared with the 20-nanometer node, this initial FinFET transition represents a SAM growth opportunity of 5% to 10% for LAM's markets and conductor etch is a key beneficiary of this transition. The complexity of the transistor increases exponentially with FinFET structures and the need for precise control of etch processes has grown accordingly. This plays well into Lam's strength as a leader in conductor etch, with the ability to control CD uniformity to within a few assets. We believe that we are well-positioned here to maintain our critical share positions and benefit from market expansion.","This FinFET transition also creates opportunities for our deposition markets over the next couple of technology nodes. Process steps requiring highly conformal dielectric films are growing. These processes have historically been very slow in nature, requiring a single heir to be deposited at a time. We are partnering with customers to develop high productivity solutions, targeting these applications.","With the need for thinner barriers and low resistivity film stacks, we are leveraging our production experience and technology leadership in tungsten deposition to further prevent metal applications. We have a strong engagements with the leading foundry and logic customers in each of these areas and are encouraged by our progress. In terms of shipped market share, based on our current outlook for 2013 WFE spend and the associated customer mix, we stand to gain a couple of points in Etch this year. We successfully won application decisions in logic and DRAM and expect to benefit from additional patterning steps in both foundry and DRAM. We've also defended above average in the initial 3D NAND's transition. In deposition, higher than expected equipment reuse has been headwind for shipped market share this year. However, we still expect to gain a point or so, supported by application wins in 3D NAND and through-silicon via copper fill.","Looking ahead, we anticipate that our application wins combines with the message around SAM expansion is a great story for Lam deposition. In single-wafer clean, we anticipate shipped market share in the upper teens this year. We've successfully defended most, all our positions in the back-end-of-line this year and continue to focus on growth opportunities in front-end applications.","We have started to ship our next-generation clean tool for evaluation with a leading customer and have focused on making these customer engagements successful. As we've shared in the past, we would expect to have a better understanding of the tool's performance in the first half of 2014, with the potential for early revenue towards the end of next calendar year.","While it is still too soon to specifically quantify share growth projections for 2014, I'm encouraged by the solid progress we're making across each of our product segments and the level of customer engagement across a broader set of applications. We remain fully committed to our stated long-term share goals, our resolve against competitive threats, never stronger.","As we have said on a number of occasions, this is a period of significant change for our customers and significant challenge within the wafer fabrication equipment industry. That fact is further illustrated by the recently announced plans to merge our 2 largest competitors. We believe the consolidation can be an opportunity to create value for our customers to the extent that it allows for the sustainable competition necessary to fuel innovation throughout the industry. As an example, our acquisitions of SEZ and Novellus Systems allowed us to leverage process adjacencies, but to stay committed to our mantra that the customer deserves the best-in-class technology and productivity solutions. That's the bases of competition today.","We do have the opinion that it is possible for consolidation to reach a size and scope that goes beyond those value-creating fundamentals, and that conversation is active with our customers, real-time. We continue to believe customers remain invested in Lam's success and we will only strengthen our collaboration with them. It is very clear that our vision of being #1 in customer trust has never been more important, or valued, than in this environment.","Prior to turning the call over to Doug for a review of the September quarter's financials, I'd like to share with you a celebratory event that occurred earlier this month. We renamed our Fremont campus, the James W. Bagley campus, in honor of Jim's many contributions to Lam Research across his 16-year tenure with the company. Among his accomplishments, Jim established Lam's mission, vision and core values, which reshaped our culture and continue to serve as the guiding principles for how all of our employees engage in business today. He also provided the inspiration and leadership to our decade-long etch segment leadership journey. I had the pleasure of working under Jim's leadership for many years and strongly believe the principles he established are the genesis of Lam's value-based culture and innovation spirit, which both differentiate the company competitively, I believe, and enable a rich and ongoing tradition of customer trust and collaboration going forward.","With that, I would like to hand the call over to Doug for his prepared remarks.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Thanks, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. In the September quarter, as Martin has already told you, we delivered record revenue for the second consecutive quarter, topping the billion-dollar mark, which was a first for Lam Research. We achieved gross margin performance at the high-end of our guidance range, with both operating margins and earnings per share exceeding our expectations. These results demonstrate what I believe are solid execution against our cost synergy objectives as well as our discipline in managing expenses.","Shipments for the September quarter came in at $987 million, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range and down a little bit, sequentially. Our results were impacted, somewhat, by delays in shipments to certain memory customers, as well as a slight decline in spares levels, driven by lower overall utilization in the industry. Partially offsetting these declines were stronger-than-expected shipments to foundry customers.","Specific to our systems business, excluding spares and services, the combined memory segment accounted for 48% of our system shipments versus 46% in June. NAND represented 28% of system shipments compared to 18% in June. DRAM was 19% of system shipments, with approximately 1% attributed to other memory shipments. On an absolute basis, memory shipments were slightly down for the June quarter.","Foundry represented 36% of total system shipments and that compares with 43% in June, and the remaining 16% was comprised of logic and other shipments.","And as I've noted earlier, we recorded more than $1 billion in revenue, which was in line with our expectations and was up 3% sequentially.","September gross margin was 45% and at the high end of our guidance range. This represents a 50 basis point improvement from the June quarter, as we delivered margin performance, in line with our published models, a bit earlier than expected, reflecting a richer mix, as well as an acceleration of our factory and manufacturing efficiency plans.","We were obviously pleased to see the benefits from the supply chain cost synergies that I've spoken about before. And as we've shared in the past, our margin performance is a function of business volumes as well as overall mix and we would expect to see fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter depending on those factors.","Operating expenses declined to $292 million, or approximately 29% of revenues, and this compares with $297 million in the June quarter. The decline reflects the timing of certain R&D program activities which can be lumpy at times. Importantly I think, the activities necessary to complete our targeted annualized cost savings of $100 million are now largely complete, and we expect to realize the remaining savings as we exit the December quarter.","Looking ahead, we will continue to seek operating efficiencies while investing in new technology and capabilities that are necessary to fuel our future growth.","Let me now turn to operating income. The combination of higher gross margin and lower operating expenses resulted in operating income of $165 million and operating margin of 16.2%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Taxes for the quarter were approximately 12%, a little bit lower than we expected. For the fiscal year 2014, I'm now expecting a tax rate in the low teens for the year. Our expectation for the December quarter was for a tax rate in the high-single to low-double digits. Can I just point out you, that if the federal R&D tax credit were extended prior to our fiscal year end, which is in June, the annual rate would be reduced by a couple of percentage points.","Based on a share count of approximately 171 million shares, earnings per share for the September quarter totaled $0.81, and that was up $0.01 from the June quarter and it exceeded our guided range. Can I just point out to you, the dilutive impact from our 2041 convertible notes was 5.6 million shares based on an average quarterly share price of $48.83. And as planned, we began executing against our $250 million share repurchase authorization during the September quarter. We spent $96 million and took delivery of approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock. We plan to complete this authorization by the end of calendar year 2014.","We ended the quarter with gross cash, short-term investments, including our restricted cash, of $2.6 billion, and that compares with $2.7 billion in the June quarter. Of this cash, roughly 25% was onshore and the remaining 75% was offshore. We had deferred revenue of $334 million, and this excludes approximately $84 million in shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters. Those Japanese shipments remained as inventory on our balance sheet.","DSO increased to 64 days, as shipments for the quarter were more back-end loaded than last quarter, something we expect to see recur in the December quarter. And I point out to you that many receivables are paid on the last day of the calendar month, which, last quarter, was 1 day after our September 29 fiscal quarter end. Had those end-of-month payments been received in the quarter, our DSO performance would have improved by several days.","Inventory turns were 3.8 and that's down from 4.1 in the June quarter, as we increased on-hand inventory to support our growing December quarter outlook.","Cash from operations was $52 million, and that's down from $175 million in the June quarter. Operational cash was depressed this quarter, primarily due to the receivable growth and inventory build activities that I just mentioned. Calendar year-to-date, distributed [ph] cash flows from operations are comparable to operating income, as a percentage of revenue, and this would be a valid planning assumption for the December quarter as well.","Company noncash expenses include, among other items, $23 million for equity comp, $42 million for amortization and $32 million for depreciation. We incurred $24 million for capital expenditures in the quarter. And finally, we exited the quarter with approximately 6,500 regular full-time employees.","So let me now turn to our guidance for the December 2013 quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect shipments to be $1.125 billion, plus or minus $30 million. Revenue of $1.1 billion, plus or minus $30 million. Gross margin at 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating margin of 18.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And earnings per share of $1.02, plus or minus $0.05, based on a share count of approximately 174 million shares.","So let me just briefly summarize. Overall, we were very pleased with our solid execution in the September quarter. Our September performance, as well as our December quarter outlook, reflect, what I believe, reflect our achievement against our near-term financial models and demonstrate our focus on delivering against our long-term business objectives. As we've shared many times, there are always puts and takes within any given quarter.","Looking into 2014, we remain focused on achieving our published models and still view them as the best proxy for modeling our financial performance. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a quick one. Martin, have you seen any impact in the December quarter from the recent Hynix file? And if so, how much of that is added to your shipment forecast for December?","Martin B. Anstice","Krish, I think that it's fair to say that, as a company, to the extent there's an impact that's reflected in our guidance and, indeed, there are some systems that are included in our shipments forecast, but we're not going to specifically disclose that number with you, with respect to our customer.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. So could I just have a quick follow-up. Martin, you highlighted how 3D NAND is going to be much more expensive. Is there any way you can quantify, from an industry standpoint, going from planar to 3D, how much more it would cost per 10,000 wafers for the industry, if the planar was around $400 million or something, how much would it be for 3D NAND?","Martin B. Anstice","I've come to appreciate, maybe I'm getting old, maybe I'm getting wise, but the best person to answer that question is the customer. Inevitably, Krish, we've got a very comprehensive understanding of the segments that we participate in, which is why the disclosure in my prepared comments biased etch and depositions segments. Whatever happens in clean is the byproduct of the yield experienced through pilot lines in the early phase of production. But we consider the opportunity in etch and deposition to be significant. We've ranged that historically in the 30% to 50% range, incremental, compared to planar baseline, and we've provided more commentary here today. I think the $25 million reference point per 10,000 wafer starts, we believe, is a significant component of the cost increase, and I think, I read in the ASML transcript that they stated LIFO intensity, in 3D, equivalent to planar. So I think you can probably connect some dots and figure that one out yourself.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Martin, the question I have, you touched upon the consolidation happening in the industry and you talked about that it can reach a point where it's not very productive. If you can elaborate on that, and also, if you can include if you have seen a reaction from your customers on how they are viewing the consolidation in the industry, and will that change your view in going after the next acquisitions?","Martin B. Anstice","I think, the -- just to kind of state the obvious, there is, inevitably, a review process associated with every deal. And so, there is a limit to the disclosure that I can make. And certainly, I don't intend to encroach on the disclosure that our customers might make. But the headline that I conveyed in my prepared comments, I think, is an important one. We do believe that size and scope can risk value-creation and, frankly, our voice in this process is a very small one, and it's not the important one. The voice, that's the important one, is the voice from the customer and the voice for the regulator. Relative to our approach to acquisition and collaboration, I would say, nothing has changed. We believe that we have a very clear vision today, to be a leader in the etch and deposition and clean markets, and to the extent that we execute any deals or collaborations or partnerships or licenses, according to the definition of today's strategy, that frames around accelerating our growth in those markets against stated plans. And the primary definition of success that I always hold us accountable to, is the value creation for the customer. And if you can articulate that, not just as a company, but as an industry, and I think the values of our company causes to do that really well because we all think and process and make decisions oriented to customer, company and then, individual, then I think you make the right decision in the end. So I think you have to talk directly with customers, at this point, to get a sense of what their opinion is.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question on operating margin, Doug. Can you describe, you have a significant upside in gross margin and operating margin for the September, as well as December quarter. Are these a permanent impact or do you have some moving parts, or lumpiness, which goes away in the March quarter? So just, if you can separate the permanent facts and some timing-related items on the gross margin and operating margin, that will be helpful.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Sure, Mahesh. Happy to do it. I think and I tried, actually, to stick in my prepared remarks a couple of different times, that was financial models that we put out are still the best planning or working assumptions, in terms of managing and modeling our financial performance. So we're thinking about those things when we make decisions here and you should think about those models when you put your numbers together, so that's my first guidance. Within gross margin, there's always puts and takes, ups and downs, mix of different tool types matters. How hard running a factory matters, the types of think going on in the factory can impact utilization and things like that, so that's important to understand. There's puts and takes, always. And as I explained, with our spending in this quarter, oftentimes, you can get spending profiles that can be lumpy, there can be big programs that happen in 1 quarter or push from 1 quarter to the next. The total spending, across multiple quarters, probably doesn't change but within any given quarter, there can be ups and downs. And you saw that, a little bit, sequentially, in September. And when you go do the math on the December quarter, you see we get back to a spending level that is kind of more in line with the previous quarter, so there's always ups and downs. To run your models, please think about those financial models that we put out in the past.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowan and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. I guess, first, Martin, just a follow-up on the questions around the Applied\/TEL deal. I mean, it sounds like, at least one big customer is definitely not very happy about it, and I'm wondering if you've seen any near-term changes in the share dynamic, i.e., have you seen any share come your way, as customers try to maybe plan around this, if it actually happens?","Martin B. Anstice","The best way I can answer that question, Tim, is somewhat similar in my prepared comments. I believe that our customers are invested in our success, and I believe they understand and appreciate the value of the stated objectives for the company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, all right. Maybe let me ask a question then, on earnings guidance. And I think I asked you the same question, last quarter. But you've beaten -- the last 6 quarters, you've beaten, by about an average of a dime, on the earnings line. So I'm wondering, have you sort of changed the way you guide or are you still guiding to what -- at least the last 6 quarters has been a fairly conservative view, and I'm just sort of wondering how to handicap that, because now you've pretty consistently begun to beat by about $0.10 per quarter.","Martin B. Anstice","Thank you for asking the questions, Tim, I'm glad you did. And I'll repeat, somewhat, the answer I gave you last time we talked about this. One of the things, I hope, everybody appreciates is the complexity associated with bringing 2 companies together. I mean, at the high level, there are integration challenges, there are product portfolio challenges, there are business process integrations, SAP systems and there is getting to know the financial performance of the company. And in every respect, we've gone through a tremendous learning curve in the last 12 to 18 months, and that includes, relative to financial performance, our guidance for the last 15, 18 months, and our guidance today is defined, in exactly the same way it has been in every year of the 13 years that I've been in Lam Research, it's our best view of our performance. And the fact that we've beaten this is sometimes the byproduct of we're kind of getting to know the company and learning how its inflows are influenced in the short term. Some part of it is, we've had changes of behavior from customers and we've had positive surprises that we've been out to exploit, competitively. And the headline that Doug conveyed, right at the end, I think, is a very important one. There is a reason why we have the long-term models of the company, they're intended to be the best commentary we can give you on financial statements and what I would not want to happen is for everybody to go, \"Oh. Every time they've beaten for the last 6. Therefore, we're going to add that $0.10 to every forward-looking guidance, because that would be inconsistent with the message that we're trying to communicate. But we're doing our very best to communicate through the eyes of management, sometimes we get positive surprises, sometimes we're more effective managing the company than we originally anticipated. But the guidance and the framework of long-term models is the very best commentary we can give you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Martin, if I could ask you to kind of characterize the dynamics of around memory spending, first, I guess, there was the comment that's some memory spending slipped out a little bit. But then based on their memory shipments, slipped out a little bit. But based on the guidance, I assuming that just slipped into the fourth quarter. So first, if can you confirm that? And then, secondly, is this a dynamic where the writing capacity exactly as they need it? Is it a dynamic that the writing capacity based on the technology transitions? Or is it a situation where one customer is kind of looking around and, seeing another customer, a competitor of theirs is adding capacity in a tight environment, and then wants to add their own capacity, so they don't lose share?","Martin B. Anstice","First question is easier than the last one. I do think that, in general, it was a very slight push from September quarter to December quarter. So your hypothesis was correct there. I think there are a couple of things that DRAM and NAND have in common and there are some things that are slightly different. So in common, I think, is the discipline of our customers relative to spending. I'm not seeing any evidence of extravagant spending behavior, almost any time a customer talks to me, or us, about market share, they're incorporating the word profitable market share into the conversation. So I think the awareness and sensitivity to the value of discipline is now well-established in the industry, and I have no expectation of that changing anytime soon. The DRAM story, obviously, there was some short-term disruption in supply chain that caused some pluses and minuses in the short term. And the principal spending outlook is oriented to upgrading capacity to the most leading-edge device. And I think the pace of the customers willingness to do that is defined around their profitability levels and their outlook for the industry. And as you know, a 3D NAND, it's a little bit more complex because you have a very fundamental device transition. And you have 4 customers that will talk about it, but their timeline for adoption by public disclosure today are significantly varied. And I frankly don't know any better than you do, whether the second, third and fourth customers accelerate plans, or keep plans as currently stated, based on the performance of the guy that's going first. So I think we are going to have a big learning experience in the first half of next year, not least for the customer that is going first. They're going to learn and impact in the marketplace. They're going to learn yield in a production environment, and that will contribute to answering your question. It's a really big question and one that is tough to answer right now.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I'm allowed one, on top of that, it would just be, the bear case on Wall Street around companies are all around the 3D NAND transition. People say 3D NAND doesn't work. It's not going to work. We're not going to see all the memory spending that you, Jim, or some of the other companies think we're going to see. What do you say when people say that, to you?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, not so many people say that to me, but if they did say it to me, I would say, \"Our customers that are articulating transitions are pretty smart people. They are convicted, and when they have established plans, previously, and in the transitions in the industry, they've kind of -- they can execute it in the way they thought they would. As I said, in the last call, until I have evidence to the contrary, I'm going to believe the statements from our customers.","Operator","The next question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Martin, always appreciative of your willingness to kind of give us macro actual numbers. I'm kind of curious, when you look to the $32 billion in WFE next year, can you give us some broad ranges of how you think that plays out between memory, logic and foundry? Just a sense of how you're thinking about those 3 buckets relative to that $32 billion WFE number?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I'm happy to do that, John. I would kind of just ask that you allow me the flexibility of kind of, slightly, a broader percentage range on these numbers because it is really early to be having a segment based conversation. But based on our understanding today, we would tend to presume that the single largest investment segment, next year, is foundry and a $13 billion to $14 billion range is probably a reasonable placeholder. The next biggest is memory, and we would see memory in the $12 billion to $13 billion range. And I think DRAM and flash are probably as close to 50-50 as they've been for a while since the dollars of invested capital and the balance is microprocessor, logic and other for us. So that $6 billion or so there. But there's a $4 billion range on the overall number I gave you. So please, remember that, as you think through the answer I've just given you.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then on -- Just to drill down on the foundry section. I think you've talked a little bit this year about 20-nanometer, you kind of given ranges between 30,000 and 50,000 wafer starts of investment, and I think, last quarter, you said the low end of that, one, has that changed. And as you think about foundry growth next year, how important is the 20-nanometer buildout? And does your number need FinFET build next year to get hit?","Martin B. Anstice","A certainly think there's traction on the FinFET 14, 16 node. I believe, every customer is publicly articulating some plans and I believe in the most recent CS&C earnings release that would say a specific statement on their timing. We have 2\/3 and 1\/3 is the relationship we're assuming right now, in terms of 20-nanometer capacity expansion next year versus the 14, 16 kind of a pilot and early phase production investments. And again, we got plenty of time to learn whether that's reasonable or not, and adjust it. I would say, as I said previously, for an equipment company, there's not a huge difference between the 20-nanometer spend and a 14, 16 spend. In fact, I think I saw a communications from customer in the last month that said, they have about a 95% equipment overlap between the final planar and first FinFET. And we've never been quite so precise in our quantification, but when the customer is articulating that and when, as I said, previously, when they visit with us, they've almost don't distinguish between the 20-nanometer ramp and the 14, 16. Hopefully, that is -- that's helpful perspective as well.","Operator","The next question is from the line with the Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the WFE view in 2014, Martin. Just wanted to see if you could share any early thoughts on how you're planning to manage the company and perhaps the first half of calendar 2014? Are you kind of managing, maybe for first half shipments, to stay at similar levels that we saw here in the second half, the calendar 2013? Or maybe something different?","Martin B. Anstice","I'm presuming you're not prepared to accept the answer, \"I plan to manage the company well.\" But I think, relative to shipments, for example, our job and the philosophy of their running this company is, \"We're going to ship to customers, when they need it. We're going to take orders off the street, when they're available to take off the street.\" As I think about running the company, there is a very clear commentary of discipline today, and I think that's probably an industry statement, but it's, for sure, a company statement. We take a lot of responsibility for the investment choices we're making. We are invested in the long-term success of the company, but we recognize that being responsible, supplementing the investment profile of the company, is really critical, and the best we can articulate, at a high level, is the financial model that Doug presented some time back for '13, '14 year and 15, 16 period. So that's really the framework for answering the question. We're not planning to go crazy spending more money next year. I suspect our customers are going to put lots of pressure on us, relative to the price of what we sell and, I suspect, the competitive dynamic will be as intense as ever. And I hope that the performance of the company, in the last 12 to 15 months, gives you some level of confidence that we are able to manage that. And certainly, that's the basis of our forecast ongoing. But I don't sit here and try to plan linear -- linearizing the calendar year. I would like us to take orders when they're available, ship when customers need it, get at revenues and qualify it as production capacity as fast as possible and collect cash. And then, start all over.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And maybe just a quick follow-up question on the December shipment guidance, can you share any color on how you think that'll split across, I guess, memory, foundry, logic?","Douglas R. Bettinger","Yes, I mean, Steve, we talked about $1.125 billion. Within that, I think memory is probably up a little bit. I think, we're seeing reuse in the logic space, so it's likely that, that's down a bit. Foundry, maybe a push to slightly up. I think you're going to see some spending in 20 and maybe some of the legacy stuff nodes behind that, down slightly. And then, spares. We do ship spares, which we don't talk all that much about. But that is driven by utilization, at times, and I think you probably know, utilization in the industry is down a little bit, so we're probably shipping a fewer spares next quarter.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the last call, you mentioned push outs by some foundry suppliers to make the move to 20 nanometers. What are you seeing in your pipeline from those customers? Are they potentially pulling the trigger this quarter? Or are they stepping up the transition to 20 nanometers, in maybe more like first half of '14? Do you have visibility into when these customers are going to transition?","Martin B. Anstice","Actually, Harlan, I don't think that the story is much different today than it was 3 months ago. I mean, at least, qualitative, I described the fact, last call that, having originally anticipated 2 customers investing at 20 in a significant way, we were seeing evidence that it might be one and, in fact, the quantified reset of WFE is made on that basis today, with our narrowed range. And there's a big debate and I don't know the answer to the debate at this point. Again, it is not so impactful to us. Is it a 20? Or are they skipping to go to 16, 14?I will tell you that the FinFET transition is a very tough one. It has a lot of complexity to it, in terms of technology transition and has a lot of complexity in terms of yielding, and it isn't going to be easy. But we have very capable customers around the world and, I believe, that they believe there are performance [ph] benefits in the end-device and cost benefits in terms of their business. And so, my presumption is, if the fabless community is on the same page, everybody's going to want to get there as fast as possible. But for an equipment company, we may be the last to know because it isn't so important.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Makes a lot of sense. When we think about the complexities of next-generation manufacturing technology as we typically tend to think of things like higher selectivity, some thickness uniformity, et cetera, but we were just talking with a large memory supplier the other day, and they were pretty frustrated about the significant increase in manufacturing cycle times with some of these next-generation technology migrations, especially in NAND and DRAM. I think they were talking about something like a 40% increase in process steps and 30% increase on average cycle times to the fabs. So as Lam competes for PTOR on some of these new process modules, how much of the decision centers more around connectivity, i.e., cycle time? And is this a major differentiator for you on some of your next-generation tools and etch step in clean","Douglas R. Bettinger","That is a really good question. I would say, as a general theme, and it's one of the reasons that the mission statement of the company doesn't just say, \"We want to be an innovator of technology.\" It says we want to be an innovator of technology and productivity solutions. I mean, the economics, for everybody, is such that we kind of deliver more to the customer around the productivity for many reasons, including the ones that you cited. That would be my general answer. At a specific level, particularly, when you get very significant changes in the definition of SAM and the most obvious example is deposition in 3D NAND. Productivity is a huge play. It isn't the only play, because there's a lot of complexity to the deposition process, high aspect ratio, reentering profiles, a lot of complexity there, in metals and in dielectric. But one of the themes of the deposition business of Lam Research is a multi-sequential station deposition architecture. And so, I believe, we have the most competitive offering in terms of productivity throughput solution sets and also clean room density, which is hugely relevant to the costs and the issues that you're describing. So I believe you're right. And I believe that the product and technology roadmap of Lam Research is structured to contribute the most value to the customer and to reinforce the legitimacy of the share gains we're pursuing.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicholas.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Martin, first, in terms of the discussion you had about the 3D NAND and the increasing SAM, related to both etch and deposition, specifically on the etch side, given your current positions in silicon and dielectric, where do you see the biggest incremental opportunities as this industry transition is being made?","Martin B. Anstice","Where do I see the biggest opportunity in etch?","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","In etch, yes, between silicon and dielectric.","Martin B. Anstice","I would say the bigger opportunity is in dielectric.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then maybe...","Martin B. Anstice","I mean, but they're both -- obviously, they're both very important, not just in terms of growth, but they're both are important it in terms of defense. So they're getting a lot of our attention, but the biggest opportunity gain is, I would say, is in dielectric. And the success, frankly, that I would describe, the planar NAND share for the company is significantly above our average, kind of going into this transition. So that's a really fabulous result for the company, if it's exactly the same, and if it's better, that takes very good to very, very good, I guess.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, now that's helpful. Maybe for Doug, on the OpEx side of things. You guys did really good job this quarter and you did mention that there is some R&D timing issues related to when projects are. Just on a going forward basis, now that you've completed the integrations with Novellus, what are some of the other levels that you can play around with, in terms of the OpEx line, as you go forward?","Douglas R. Bettinger","Patrick, there's always tons of opportunities to do things more efficiently and better. And in the technology industry, you have to do that every year, and we will be doing that as we get into the next calendar year. In terms of thinking about it, Patrick, I'd encourage you to go back those financial models that I referred to. We've kind of got a certain level of spending baked into those models and that really is how we're thinking about -- running and managing the company is making sure we achieve and attain those models that we've committed to you guys.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the foundry segment, when you talk about 2014 expectation, do you see any kind of seasonality and foundry spending next year? Or do you think that this year -- next year is going to be different, given that only one customer is having 20 nanometer, and given a piece of technology [indiscernible]. And I have a follow-up.","Martin B. Anstice","I think I gave my best shot at answering that already. I -- clearly, there is one customer that, at least today, is leading the investments and the public commentary from them supports that. And clearly, there are a number of companies invested in creating an opportunity for competitive advantage with the FinFET transition. So maybe that's the slightly different story. But all things being equal, we would say, at this point, that the 20 nanometer is reasonably concentrated but broadening a little. And the 14 and the 16 FinFETs node is very early, obviously, and I think the foundry community wants to be -- everyone of them wants to be there first, for fairly intuitive reasons.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And just of the foundry shipments, what percentage of your shipments would be to the 28? Or excluding the 20 nanometers, what percentage of your shipments will be to some of the other customers?","Martin B. Anstice","For next year?","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","For the fourth [ph] quarter.","Martin B. Anstice","I'm not sure. I don't have that to hand, unfortunately. I can't give you that right now.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Yes. We typically don't break it at that level of detail, Vishal.","Carol Raeburn","Operator, we have time for 2 more questions, I think.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","First question, on foundry shipment. Do guys see any pull within -- you mentioned shipments would be higher in the September quarter, and it's sounds like December, it remains strong. Any risk that business is going pulled in from the first half of '14 into the second half of this year?","Martin B. Anstice","I guess, the only honest answer to that question is, there's always risk, but we don't see it today.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I see. Okay, that's fair. And then, maybe moving on to 3D NAND. You mentioned you're beyond the one large customer that -- obviously, if you a NAND customer who was working towards that and you're targeting a similar option in those customer, have any -- when we listen to this customer, they talk about 3D NAND being, frankly, some of them talk about 2 years out, right?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","How realistic are those opportunities being a 2014 opportunity? Or are lot of that still quite far out? And in terms of customer decision, are they getting close to making a decision? Because typically, they have to make the decision ahead of time, right? Are they close to a decision for equipment choice or are they still pretty far along?","Martin B. Anstice","I think, it varies enormously by customer. And it's one of the things we talked about in the analyst meeting and, again, in the last call. There are timelines of PTOR decisions and they range by, probably a year, from first customer to last customer, and there are PTOR decisions for customers that range, I think, 2 years, probably. And so, whether it's resting on our laurels or not, we've got to manage the risk that when we think we've won, that we can protect that win, all the way through the adoption. And when we haven't won, that we can turn it around for a production buy. So I would say, generally, the 3D NAND environment is still, significantly, in flux. Certainly, when it comes to high-volume manufacturing, and that will probably be true for a reasonable period of time in calendar '14.","Operator","It's your final question. It's from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a very quick single question. I, obviously -- commented on EUV push outs. I want to understand your perspective of what's going on there, and whether you're seeing any feedback from customers, specifically, with regard to roadmaps that used to be EUV versus traditional multi-patterning?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, it's a question I always ask the customer, and I have a sense that the answer that they give me is very similar to the answer that they'd probably give you. So I don't to have too much to add. Obviously, it shows up for us, in a tangible way, around patterning opportunities. And I would say, today, the recent disclosures we would only see as a positive, relative to an opportunity for Lam Research, principally in etch, but also, to some extent, in deposition. And I don't see downside to the SAM as we know it today, or the increased patents that we shared with you in our recent 2 analyst meetings. So for me, our job is to support the needs of the customer, and where they don't have any real alternative to patterning, they're going to look to us. And our job is to do that as economically as we can.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Martin, you said you don't see downside to multi-patterning. Do you see upsides based on recent developments?","Martin B. Anstice","I guess, I can always be hopeful of that, and the reason I'm, perhaps, I'm hesitant is because, if I do, there are upsides that would show up a couple of years from now, right? When you've kind of gone beyond double and you're into quadruple and I even saw a presentation with octuple, the other day. Now whether that ever plays out, that's a number of years away and a lot can change on an EUV roadmap or a customer's device architecture between now and then. So we'll cross that bridge when we get there.","Operator","And that's all the time that we have for Q&A. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Martin B. Anstice","I like to say thank you, all, again, for your continued interest in the company. As you likely can extract from our discussion today, we're very pleased at the continued progress against our mission and vision objectives. We remain excited about our future opportunities and customer partnerships. Based on our current understanding, we expect an expanding WFE market through 2014, and believe that Lam is nicely positioned in the areas of technology transition. The legacy strength of the company bodes well for the generally anticipated memory investment expansion. The new products across each of our businesses continue to strengthen our competitiveness, and the culture and values of our new company are firmly established. We believe that action speaks louder than words and hope the demonstration of financial performance reported today, that's consistent with our model, is recognized generally as validating our vision and our strategies and execution capability broadly. Thank you, again. We look forward to meeting with key shareholders in the coming quarter to discuss these themes more.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Lam Research Corporation December 2012 Quarterly Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Shanye Hudson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Shanye Hudson","Lorenzo, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Lam Research Corporation's quarterly conference call. Here with me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ernie Maddock, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Shortly, Ernie will discuss financial results for the December 2012 quarter. Martin will then share Lam's business outlook for the March 2013 quarter before opening the call up for Q&A.","The press release detailing our financial results was distributed over the wire services shortly after 1 p.m. this afternoon and is also available on our website at lamresearch.com.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements, including those related to our expectations for the global macroeconomic environment; of market size; wafer fab equipment spending; the revenue expectations of shipments to our Japanese customers; technology trends and transitions that may affect our business; market share changes; consumer demand, customer spending and behavior and the factors that will influence those expectations; as well as our spending projections, our investment plans, our business strategies, our expectations of the benefits resulting from our Novellus acquisition; our intentions for research and development activities; our contemplated tax rate; and our forecast of market share, shipments, revenues, expenses, margins, operating profit, share repurchase activities, earnings per share and cash generation on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as other statements of the company's expectations, beliefs and plans.","There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements, and a list of these factors can be found in the slide package accompanying this conference call and on our most recent Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","All forward-looking statements are based on current information, and the company assumes no obligation to update any of them.","This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 p.m., and we ask that you please limit questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up.","And so with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Ernie.","Ernest E. Maddock","Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin my prepared remarks, I'd like to add a few words to the press release announcing my planned departure from the company in April.","First, I'd like to convey how much I've enjoyed working with each of you since my appointment in the CFO role in September 2008 and that I look forward to continuing to do so in the next couple of months. I also appreciate the experience of being part of a values-based management team that puts customers first, and I'm committed to ensure a smooth and orderly transition to my successor. Now on to business.","The December quarter results reflect a solid finish to our calendar year as we met or exceeded the midpoints of our guidance in all areas. Total shipments were $803 million, down 14% sequentially. Approximately 78% of our system shipments were for applications at the sub-4X technology node and by segment breakdown as follows: foundry shipments accounted for 51% of total system shipments; the memory segment accounted for 20% of total system shipments, which includes NAND at 11% and DRAM at 9%; comprising the remainder were logic and other at 29%.","Revenue in the December quarter was $861 million, down 5% from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 44.2%, down just 20 basis points from the prior quarter, reflecting favorability in our product mix, complemented by our continued focus on operational execution.","Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $281 million, down $3 million from September and in line with our expectations of synergy achievement.","We remain focused on our integration efforts and are making strong headway towards achieving our cost-related synergy targets of $100 million. Two key elements of this achievement are the transition to a single ERP system and the completion of activities related to supply chain rationalization, and in the December quarter, we made significant progress in both areas. This progress will pave the way for the remaining $60 million of annualized run rate operating expense and cost of goods sold synergies, which we've committed by the end of calendar year '13.","Although Martin will be providing March quarter guidance in a few minutes, it's worth noting that the March quarter of 2013 will see both an extra week of operating expenses together with our normal seasonal increase in employer taxes, which represent approximately $10 million.","Back to December, non-GAAP operating income was $99 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 11.5%, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 17.3% compared to 16.3% in the prior quarter. With the extension of the federal R&D tax credit earlier this month, we would now expect our tax rate for the fiscal year to be in the low double digits. Under this scenario, we expect a March quarter non-GAAP tax rate near 0% and a June quarter non-GAAP tax rate in the low single-digit range. Based on a share count of approximately 173 million shares, non-GAAP earnings per share for the December quarter were $0.45.","Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, of $2.7 billion in total versus $2.9 billion for the September quarter, with our cash generation again being exceeded by our ongoing share repurchase program. Approximately 40% of the December ending cash balance was onshore.","DSO and inventory turns for the December quarter were both slightly improved at 62 days and 4.1 turns, respectively.","We ended the quarter with deferred revenue of $282 million, excluding approximately $46 million in shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters.","Cash from operation was $193 million, or 22% of revenue, in the December quarter, and combined company noncash expense include, among other items, $24 million for equity compensation, $44 million for amortization and $34 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $39 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 regular, full-time employees.","In closing, I want to provide an update on our share repurchase activity during the December quarter. We bought back around 10 million shares of common stock for approximately $354 million at an average price of $34.74 per share. For the full calendar year 2012, we've repurchased nearly $1.4 billion at an average price of $35.74. We've continued to execute our share repurchase program subsequent to the close of the December quarter and, as of today, have approximately $100 million of the authorization remaining. Consistent with our comments on our analyst meeting, we will provide a further update on our capital deployment strategy once we have completed the current authorization. With that, I'll now turn it over to Martin.","Martin B. Anstice","Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. As Ernie just reported, we had a solid finish to 2012, including a transformative year for Lam Research. The year began following our announced merger with Novellus Systems, and we aggressively executed plans to integrate both companies. On the strategic front, we presented a single face to our customers starting day 1, which is a function of our rigorous planning efforts, and we executed to the commitments made as 2 stand-alone companies.","We enhanced our focus on core businesses and made the decision to divest the Peter Wolters business and transition PVD to a sustaining mode with existing customers. We have successfully combined organizations and made progress in streamlining our infrastructure. We have established an ambitious plan for integrating business systems and remain on track to complete the majority of that work by the middle of this year. We're well down the path towards achieving our target of $100 million in cost synergies.","Related to capital structure, we repurchased approximately 39 million shares of stock, returning nearly $1.4 billion to our shareholders through 2012. This financing strategy monetized overall industry and economic conditions, lowering the effective purchase price of Novellus by approximately $200 million.","Within our etch business, we had our customary opportunities and threats, successes and failures. But after more than a decade of absence for Lam, we are pleased to report today that we have now been successful in achieving a production tool of record selection by a leading logic company. We have received our first production tool order and expect business to continue to materialize in calendar year 2013.","We are very pleased with these accomplishments and many more not called out today. They are testament to the dedication and hard work of our employees and the commitment to our values and vision by our leadership team. A big thank you is due to all.","Relative to market share, we believe we are #1 or strong #2 in each of the product segments we now serve. We view this as crucial given the increasing focus by our customers and strategic partners to work with a select few leading equipment suppliers.","Worthy of note for calendar 2012 in deposition and strip, we were successful in gaining critical back-end-of-line applications in PECVD at a couple of key logic manufacturers for both leading-edge production and next-generation device nodes. We acquired Axcelis' dry-strip intellectual property, further strengthening our product road map, particularly for non-oxidizing strip applications for advanced memory and logic.","Overall, we are on a positive trajectory broadly, achieving shipped share across our targeted deposition markets in the mid-30% range and are realizing initial plans beyond traditional WFE growth to advanced packaging.","In etch, we had forecast and we delivered in 2012 a relatively neutral year in terms of shipped share. More specifically, we successfully defended over 90% of the n and n+1 PTOR decisions that were made in 2012, and we positioned penetrations to gain a percentage point or so in the remaining selection decisions in 2013.","We introduced next-generation uniformity control hardware for our conductor products. This capability is targeted for advanced logic and memory applications at the sub 20-nanometer technology node and is gaining traction with customers already. And as stated earlier, we achieved our goal of penetrating a leading logic company after a long period of absence.","Turning to the single-wafer clean market. We've spoken about a few trends that have developed over the last couple of years. First is the transition from batch to single-wafer processing for front-end applications, and second is the introduction of high-productivity platforms. Lam is focused on developing a next-generation clean product, which will enable us to more effectively compete for a broader range of applications inclusive of these areas. We were successful in defending essentially 100% of the positions we held with our existing products in 2012. However, until the new product is released, our opportunities for share expansion are limited, and our shipped share will likely remain in the 20% range, plus or minus a couple of points, until that time.","2013 is a critical year for us in clean. We are actively testing and characterizing the new products and are on track to begin shipping beta units for key customer evaluations around the middle of this year.","Overall, we remain committed to deliver against our long-term share gain targets of 3% to 5% in etch, 4% to 8% in deposition and 5 to 10 percentage points in single-wafer clean. We have confidence in our ability to develop the best-in-class products and leverage our recently expanded adjacencies to deliver differentiated solutions to capture a disproportionate number of the opportunities created by technology inflections. As discussed extensively before, the inflections, including patterning, FinFET, 3D NAND and TSV, are all creating growth opportunities. Sometimes, those are measured in terms of market share expansion and sometimes in terms of market size expansion. Our continued execution and decision making to reinforce customer trust are fundamental to achieving our goals.","Touching briefly on the industry environment, we had outlined a scenario for WFE spending to be within a range of $30 billion in 2013 last November. From our perspective at the segment level, NAND investment remains the primary uncertain influence over 2013 spending. Obviously, the macro remains a major consideration also.","Based on our analysis, since November, a couple of additional inputs have been made available: slight upticks in outlooks for WFE in 2013 from 2 of the top 3 semiconductor companies, and a slight reduction in NAND spending due to likely higher proportion of conversion than originally planned. Taken as a whole, the $30 billion WFE level, plus or minus $2 billion, remains our planning assumption.","As we discussed during our recent analyst event, our view is based on the following primary assumptions. For a third straight year, we are forecasting essentially no new capacity additions for DRAM with bit growth demand in the range of 30%, investments are limited to upgrades and conversions. In NAND, we are forecasting demand growth in a range of 50%, which would require capacity investments to resume towards the middle of this year. Absent any new capacity additions, we believe supply would be limited to around 40% bit growth through conversions.","3D NAND investments are seen to be late in the year, and we currently forecast approximately 20,000 wafer starts of 3D NAND capacity to ship by the end of 2013.","We project foundries to strongly continue making 28-nanometer investments and forecast 28-, 32-nanometer capacity in the range of 330,000 wafer starts, plus or minus, per month exiting 2013.","Additionally, 20-nanometer will begin to ramp in the second half, and we currently expect total capacity to reach approximately 40,000 wafer starts at that node by the end of the year.","Finally, our forecast reflects a slight decline year-over-year in other logic spending with the potential for upside given recently announced spending plans.","Using $30 billion as our baseline, our resulting expectation is for spending to increase through the year with approximately 55% of total spending occurring in the second half. In this environment, given the consolidation of our customer base and overall competitive dynamics, we continue to fund long-term strategic investments and execute the strategies that we articulated during our recent analyst event.","To name a few areas of focus, we're engaging with customers on conformal film applications by leveraging our ability to deposit metals and dielectrics in high aspect ratio structures with the atomic layer precision required for FinFET devices.","We're engineering tungsten films with the lowest resistivity for filling these structures, which ultimately benefits the electrical performance of the device.","We've introduced proprietary hardware on our conductor etch tool, which enables selectivity at the atomic level required by high aspect ratio features.","We've designed that same proprietary hardware for our dielectric tool, which widens the process window, enabling customers to achieve their stringent requirements associated with high aspect ratio processes also in 3D NAND.","In addition, in 3D NANDs, we're combining our strengths in defectivity control and process repeatability, both important in logic applications with the productivity advantages offered by our multi-station sequential deposition architecture to strengthen our PTOR positions in PECVD.","In through-silicon via, we are leveraging our knowledge as a market leader in Electrofill and advanced pretreatments to grow our market share.","We're also working towards capturing all available benefits of the merger with Novellus. Ernie outlined our progress to achieving our stated cost synergy targets. Beyond that, our focus is on executing plans to achieve accelerated growth and deliver on the value proposition this union brings to our customers and shareholders.","Finally, we remain focused on prudently managing spending, which includes our commitment to contain quarterly operating expenses to a level no greater than $305 million per quarter at $1 billion revenue level through 2013.","Turning now to our outlook for the March 2013 quarter. Our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: shipments of $880 million, plus or minus $30 million; revenues of $830 million, plus or minus $30 million; gross margin at 43.5%, plus or minus 1%; operating profit at 8%, plus or minus 1.5%; and earnings per share of $0.35, plus or minus $0.07, based on a share count of approximately 170 million shares.","Prior to taking questions, I would like to take a moment on behalf of the board of directors, the management team and the employee population to recognize Ernie for his dedication of service to Lam for the past 15 years and especially for his service as CFO. Ernie has made a big impact on the company throughout his tenure. He has a work ethic that is truly remarkable. He sets a standard of performance that challenges those around him to achieve more than they thought possible. And he has a versatility level that has accommodated the significant breadth of responsibilities held during his time at Lam.","As noted in our press release today, Ernie's planned departure will be handled smoothly and without disruption to our customers, our shareholders or our employees. We have an active search ongoing, and Ernie will remain until a new person is in place and plans to assist in the transition. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Ernie for his service, for his accomplishments and his commitment to the company, our shareholders and our employees throughout his career and wish him every success in his future.","We will now open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ernie, let me offer my congratulations up front. You've done a great job and it's -- you're a real glutton for punishment as you kind of stuck with everything through the tough part of the cycle. And as things start to look up, you're moving on, so congratulations on that.","Ernest E. Maddock","Thanks, Jim.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, Martin, if I could start off. Certainly, it's a unique time in the cycle because we have obviously a couple of the big customers talking about record CapEx and some of the other big customers talking about things coming down a little bit, and then you mentioned a comment about better expectations in the back half. How do you balance out the very likely prospect, as you highlighted, of NAND getting a lot better in the second half of the year versus TSMC's comments that 2\/3 of their CapEx was kind of front half loaded? Do you think that NAND can pick up enough to offset the expected declines at TSM?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I think to your point, they're obviously very unconnected variables. I guess if there is a connection, it would be a macro. But that aside, our view is that if you believe in the $30 billion baseline that we've talked about, we would expect a 45-55 split in the calendar year. So I think in the foundry space, the commentary from TSMC in the public domain is exactly as you articulated. My expectation is that a broader foundry participation exists in the second half of the year. But first half, second half, overall, we're assuming 45-55. And by segment, I'd assume DRAM is about 50-50. The foundry world, all in, is probably 50-50 with every participant, and the world of flash looks more like a 30-70 kind of split. So it's a very kind of diverse, segment-based progression in the year, and we're kind of focused on execution independent of that, frankly.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. If I could ask for my follow-up. On the big opportunity in logic that you penetrated, first of all congratulations on that. Second of all, what -- how big do you think that opportunity could be? In other words, of the process tool of record you could eventually have there, what percentage do you think you're currently shipping?","Martin B. Anstice","Our aspirations extend beyond our penetration. That's a fair statement. We owe respect to a lot of our customers. And as you might expect, answering a very specific like -- a question like that is kind of one of them. So we're focused on building upon the momentum we have clearly established. We're excited about the opportunities. At the end of the day, we have tough competition, and we have to execute well. But I think calendar '13 is a very instrumental year relative to the position that we've established.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","My first question is on the 3D NAND. I think when you're referring to the opportunity, you said you expect somewhere between [ph] 20,000 wafer starts for this year to be coming in the second half. I was curious what technology do you expect to come in. Our understanding on some of the 3D NAND technologies, there is not much change in 2 set [ph] from existing NAND. How do you -- can you make some comments around that as well?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I mean, we're not assuming, frankly, an immense proportion of investments directed to 3D NAND production. We clearly are expecting some in the second half, and that's important in terms of the size of the opportunity and the share growth that we believe we are targeting. But the inflection points even for the most ambition -- ambitious customers in the transition will only kind of show evidence of traction on spending towards the end of the calendar year. So -- and I think, just giving you maybe a little bit more data beyond the comment I made to Jim's question, we do see some evidence that there's a little bit more of a bias to conversions today in the calendar year than we previously anticipated, and our assumption remains that there's about 115,000 wafer starts of new capacity added in NAND this year and about 500,000 wafer starts of conversion. And that kind of delves [ph]    it to the original plan of record that we had. It's probably about $0.5 billion. I'm not sure it's that material in the scheme of things, but that's the kind of essence of our outlook today.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great, that was very helpful. And then just kind of going back to your win at a logic customer. Just curious, is there a way you can you kind of describe what technical advantage you have on that, too? And I know you probably don't want to put in too much in terms of your contacts in the opportunity, but maybe just talk about is it only in conductor? Is it kind of branching beyond conductor? Or do you see yourself branching beyond conductor in the current technology node that, that customer is ramping?","Martin B. Anstice","I'm going to substitute the word probably for definitely. It's a big deal to make any change, and one of the scale and scope with a customer is very  significant. I did speak to the fact that this was a conductor penetration. The reason I believe the penetration was successful is because a lot of people worked very hard over a long period of time. I believe we have technical deference -- differentiation that's valued and recognized by the customer. And in a very important phase of delivering that, we executed very well, and our challenge and our opportunity is to continue to execute very well. And I believe that if we do that, we will hopefully have opportunities ahead of us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays.","Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Olga Levinzon calling in for C.J. Just wanted to follow up on the logic win. If we take your -- the wins that you've been able to get there, coupled with the comments that we heard from the customer last week and, I guess, some of the incremental 3D NAND and 20-nanometer etch opportunities that you highlighted for this year, what sort of etch share gains could we count on for either on a shipment or revenue basis for 2013?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, that's a really interesting question, and thank you for your comments at the beginning there. There are clearly opportunities in front of us still in the 20-nanometer transition. But frankly speaking, and I think this is kind of true for everybody, because the next transition in foundry to the FinFET structure is such a significant one, if the customer can find any way possible to retain their 28-nanometer selection, they're biased to do that, and that's something that affects us all as equipment companies. And I believe that will continue to play out as a fairly dominant reality there. There are opportunities to displace other people, to grow. There are also risks. And from my perspective, it will be defined around execution, and it will be defined around kind of productivity. I think the focus of the customer when they happen, the full spectrum of challenges in front of them with a FinFET adoption is going to clearly bias more stability in share in 28 to 20 has been significant swing [ph] . We're really focused for the reasons we talked about in our analyst call on the significant inflections, including the FinFET. And that is one of the things in the mix of the 3% to 5% share gain in etch that we talked about as a long-term objective. And although perhaps a little discounted to the average because of the dominance of lithography investments in logic, the investments in patterning as a market is something that affords the company opportunity as well.","Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I guess could you see, I guess, a decent move in that 3% to 5% etch share gains for this year? Or will the 20-nanometer more meaningful ramp in 2014 be kind of the key driver to getting to that 3% to 5% goal?","Martin B. Anstice","I think directly to your question, I just said no.","Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then on the double -- on the kind of the maintaining the WFE outlook and talking about NAND being much more second half weighted, have you seen any -- I know that you don't disclose orders, but any sort of order activity from any of the NAND customers to sort of support your view on both the demand growth and the capacity that would be necessary in the second half of the year?","Martin B. Anstice","They're very slight, but I don't think that's particularly relevant, with due respect, because the cycle time, the lead time now between a purchase order and the additional capacity is so short. A second half ramp will be kind of bookings towards the end of the first half of this year. So that will be the reality. That is the reality for all of us. And I think the best I can offer you is the commentary around demand, which, in the areas of the smartphone, the mobile space generally, the SSD road map, the kind of server and cloud space, there are some decent catalysts of demand in NAND flash and the supply is really tight. We ended calendar '12 with about the tightest balance of supply and demand that we believe has existed in several years, and I think that should give folks confidence that unless there's a very significant input in terms of technical challenge or macros, the investment will kind of play out or, frankly, the big growth that's necessary to support some of this road map, we believe, won't be available.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Terence Whalen with Citigroup.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to echo my congratulations and best of luck to Ernie.","Ernest E. Maddock","Thank you.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The first question that I have is regarding a comment you made on 20-nanometer capacity being 40,000 wafers per month by the end of calendar '13. When you made that comment, were you referring to only one customer's foundry capacity? Or does that assume multiple foundries having 20-nanometer available?","Martin B. Anstice","Not one, correct.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, terrific. And then as my follow-up, I just wanted to actually -- one that relates to the OpEx side of things. In terms of cost synergy, you made the comment that you remain on track with an additional $60 million of cost synergy by end of calendar '13. But can you just remind us for the remainder of the cost synergy what the split is between OpEx and COGS?","Ernest E. Maddock","Terence, this is Ernie. You're going to probably see something like 80% -- 75% to 80% COGS and 20% to 25% OpEx over that remainder of work that's yet to be completed over the course of this calendar year.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one last one is again, coming back to the 20-nanometer comment. As we look into the beginning of 2014 and see sort of a morphing between 20 and 16 and 14 tri-gate, do you expect that, that will be led by one customer? Do you expect 2 customers to be spending on tri-gate foundry in the beginning of '14?","Martin B. Anstice","That's getting awfully specific about the plans of the second of the foundries. I would say you should assume there is a lot of credence in kind of 2 public inputs. One of them is the input from TSMC around the speed of ramping that they expect in 20 nanometer. And the public commentary from the fabless community, which tends to speak to an interest in having multiple supply alternatives. So I guess that's the best I can give you in terms of response there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And congrats again, Ernie, for a terrific career. And I'm pretty sure all the investors besides your employees are going to be missing you.","Ernest E. Maddock","Thank you.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Then, I'm going to have a -- I had a couple of questions. Number one, Martin, is there any way to quantify? We're hearing TSMC going to 20-nanometer planar end of the year and the recent chat about Samsung looking at 16- or 14-nanometer, whatever you call that, and it appears that might be a FinFET approach. So when a foundry moves from a 20-nanometer planar to a 16- or 14-nanometer FinFET, what are the incremental opportunities for Lam just going from planar to FinFET of the node?","Martin B. Anstice","I'm probably -- I'll give -- I mean, I'll give you a general answer, which is I think a lot of the specifics are going to deal with the patterning consequences in that transition. I mean, clearly, the importance of etch in the formation of the transistor is going up, which would tend to suggest that the complexity is increasing and process times, if anything, will get longer. So that will kind of feed into answering your question. And I do believe there's incremental growth for the company in the FinFET transition. I don't believe that increment is quite as great as the increments we saw from 40 to 28 with high-k\/metal gate or 28 to 20, but we will see. I mean, I think there's still a lot of unanswered questions there.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. And then just as a follow-up, congrats on your -- I mean, with the logic customer on the conductor side. So my question was what was the conductor etch market you think exiting 2012? And what do you think it would be baking in this logic win?","Martin B. Anstice","So I believe our shipped market share exiting 2012 was in the kind of high 40s range, and you've heard us talk about kind of 3 to 5 percentage points as a long-term growth objective. And while specifically, the position that you just referred to is not a prerequisite to execute that, it certainly helps us manage risk, and it certainly helps us kind of get to the high end of the range in the plans that we have.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And what was the -- just the conductor etch specifically market share in 2012? I think your mid-40s is probably. . .","Ernest E. Maddock","Yes, probably. I am -- I was -- everyone in the room's looking at me going, \"What are you saying?\" and now I know why. Yes, so we're typically in the 75% range, 80% range as a baseline for conductor etch. So 70% to 80% is probably a decent range to be thinking of.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.","Mark J. Heller - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Ernie, I'm going to put you on the spot here. So you maintain the $30 billion wafer fab equipment number. I think on the Analyst Day you had said revenues for the year would be about $4.1 billion on a $30 billion WFE, so I'm wondering if that still stands.","Ernest E. Maddock","Yes, it does. However, I would hasten to point out that we were really clear on our Analyst Day presentation that, that was not a 2013 forecast and that presumes, for example, the disposition of the Peter Wolters business as well as some incremental share gains. So as it turns out, all the great news that Martin has shared may actually allow all that to come true in 2013, which would be a little earlier than we thought. But in general, and we have taken a look at our progress vis-\u00e0-vis our model, and we're pretty happy with where we stand in light of what we shared with you back in November.","Mark J. Heller - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just a question on the quarter. So it looks like the logic part of the shipments were up pretty significantly in the quarter. I'm just wondering what drove that as it sounds like the logic customer isn't ramping until another couple of quarters or a quarter or so.","Ernest E. Maddock","Yes, I mean, one, I think you need to think about the overall shipment number in total, and we're dealing with a percentage. And so given the incremental lack of representation from the memory segment, that also will have the effect of making the foundry segment appear a little bit larger than it had. And then we had a pretty strong representation from the other logic segment. And so at the end of the day, it was a combination of those 3 things.","Martin B. Anstice","So at an application level, the comment I would add is image sensors, kind of server as well as kind of general microprocessor, there was -- that's the composition of that segment. So the image sensor space was definitely kind of a decent component.","Mark J. Heller - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then next, for calendar Q1, any thoughts there?","Ernest E. Maddock","For calendar Q1, we would expect to see probably a little bit stronger representation from the memory segments, continued strong showing in the foundry world and then the logic and other segment perhaps dropping back to more normalized levels.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to understand your trajectory for the year. You mentioned 55% in the second half for WFE. How should I think about your revenue profile, I mean, assuming the 4.1 plays out this year? I mean, are we talking about 40-60 first half, second half? Is that -- given the share gain prospects for the second half?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I don't know if I can directly answer it, but you should -- I think you're smart enough to kind of understand the timing differences between shipments and revenues, and the shipment is the best correlation to the timing of WFE. So certainly, it's going to be kind of closer to that than the 45-55 baseline, but it's frankly highly dependent on the timing of shipments within a quarter. The difference between a first month-biased shipment quarter and a last month shipment quarter is significant in terms of answering the question that you're asking. But making an assumption that there's a one-quarter delay on average between a shipment event and a revenue event is not an unreasonable baseline.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And just wanted to understand your -- that idea [ph] of getting close to the buybacks that you had announced. I mean, what are your thoughts around cash and use of cash as you think about the next couple of years?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I think the consistency is hopefully loud and clear. Our primary investment bias is in the profitable growth of this company. And to the extent that we have cash that is excess to that need, then we review all options available to us in terms of distribution. But beyond that, frankly nothing to say until we're done with the authorization in place.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And Ernie, I'd also like to extend my congratulations and best of luck on your future endeavors.","Ernest E. Maddock","Thanks.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Martin, on your Analyst Day, you talked about TSV as being one of your growth opportunities and one of inflection points for Lam on a going forward basis. I guess what do you see at this point come in terms of the traction, the adoption? And what do you believe right now as maybe inhibiting, I guess, the increasing use of TSV?","Martin B. Anstice","My assumption is a little bit economic still. But presumably kind of at the end of the day, the form factor requirements of the device are kind of part of answering your question as well. And for the company, we're very pleased about the positioning of the company in that application area. It is early days in terms of the size of that marketplace. I don't know if the TSV-specific SAM is going to be much more, about $100 million of WFE, this year, but that's 70% expansion year-over-year. So it's an important component of growth opportunity. It's a very important inflection. But in relative terms, it's still early days.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And a question for you, Ernie. In terms of the cost savings targets and the integration, you mentioned ERP and the supply chain rationalization. Are they still the biggest drivers on a going forward basis as you achieve that goal? Or is there is still one major project that you have to do internally to get to that remaining $60 million that's still out there?","Ernest E. Maddock","Now, Patrick, as we've talked about before, obviously the supply chain work has most impacted the cost of goods sold. The ERP integration is going to enable the remainder of the operating expense synergies. So for sure, there are a number of other smaller projects with other milestones, but it's hard to think of any more that approach that scope and scale and impact.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Westin Twigg with Pacific Crest.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","First, just wondering if you're seeing yet any inflection in orders related to double patterning ramps this year.","Martin B. Anstice","I'd say always. I mean, the patterning environment generally is a perpetually expanding marketplace. And as we articulated, the spending concentration in the leading foundry space and logic space is significant. So yes, each and every day we show up to work, the answer to that question is yes.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","But I guess specifically not just patterning but double patterning orders are starting to benefit your order book?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, yes.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then also, just on the Axcelis agreement, collaboration on materials, just wondering if you can help us understand maybe the importance of implant etch interactions and what you might be potentially working on with Axcelis.","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, we are in the very early stages of kind of developing the plans, and, frankly, there is a very obvious competitive consequence to saying too much on this call. But I am optimistic that the types of things that are available to one of my competitors as a result of their acquisition is available to us in terms of joint development activity. So we're going to work hard to make that possible, and I think we're pretty excited about developing opportunities and plans in the weeks and months ahead.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a clarification to start off, Martin. What was your estimate of 2012 wafer fab spending?","Martin B. Anstice","Ask the question again. 2012 what?","Ernest E. Maddock","I think it's...","Martin B. Anstice","WFE, was that your question?","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes.","Martin B. Anstice","Oh, $28 billion.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","$28 billion? Okay. And related to your March guidance, there is slight decline in your gross margin of 50 basis points even though you're taking up your shipment guidance 10% or so. And the customer mix shouldn't hurt you as much, I guess. It's more to Taiwan, I would think. Could you just talk a bit about pricing, any volume thus far and the like affecting gross margins? And then on OpEx, there is a fairly sizable step-up in OpEx, I guess, embedded in your guidance. Again, it's below what you're saying your model is, but there is a sequential increase in OpEx of $14 million. Is there any increase in OpEx that's being driven again due to competitive reasons because plate [ph]    materials is going through a management transition or are these problematic spending that's happening?","Ernest E. Maddock","So Satya, this is Ernie. I tried to give you as much color on that as I could in my comments when I suggested that given that the company had an extra week of -- week's worth of OpEx in the March quarter, so we literally have a 13-week quarter or a 14-week quarter, plus you have the normal seasonality of payroll taxes. That's a $10 million lump for a company that is the size, scope and scale of the new Lam. And I'll -- Martin will provide commentary on the customer agreements, but if you look at the gross margin performance vis-\u00e0-vis the revenue decline, actually I think it does speak to the continued work we're doing on the synergy activities as well as some amount of benefit gain from the factory. So my view would be that the gross margin performance in the March quarter is pretty consistent with the ebb and flow of the business and the customers and the products. And so we're actually pretty, pretty pleased with that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Maybe another question on NAND here. Do your comments include NAND that was taken offline last year that's coming back online? Or is it strictly, is the NAND portion running full out right now and they're going to convert from DRAM to NAND?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, our comments include our best understanding of available capacity and current utilization, correct.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. I'm just wondering if you think the conversion is going to pick up here, does your view of DRAM change at all this year?","Martin B. Anstice","I don't know if I'd make a big connection between those 2 things. I think the kind of dominant answer to the DRAM investment is the PC. We've gotten kind of maybe a little bit more conservative on the PC in the last 2 months, having been kind of maybe articulating a view of neutral to slightly up to being kind of neutral to slightly down. I think that's kind of the overwhelming tribe [ph] . But, I mean, there are some kind of nice headlines in terms of mobile-related DRAM growth, and the non-PC proportion of DRAM is very important. But I think the catalyst for investments in terms of capacity addition is going to be tied to the PC story.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. You don't see a big difference in your tool set between mobile DRAM and PC DRAM?","Martin B. Anstice","That's kind of hard for me to speak to that. I don't think so.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Pang with B. Riley Caris.","Benedict Pang - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","You commented on 2012 you defended 90% of your positions in etch. How has that historical looked over the last 3 years? Is that about the number that you have or is that better?","Martin B. Anstice","We're usually in the kind of, I would say, maybe 85% to 95% range is probably like our history. I wasn't really kind of trying to focus too much on the number, more focused on the qualitative commentary of the strength of the differentiation: is there evidenced by an overwhelmingly successful kind of defense? And so one of the questions that was asked a little earlier around spending profile in the company, our focus is on our offense. We clearly have to defend effectively. We don't defend everything. We never do. But on average, if we defend more than we don't and win more of our penetrations than others, then the share of the company goes up. And that's the plan, and that's why we stand committed to our 3% to 5% long-term goal.","Benedict Pang - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And is there any pattern around that? The 10% or 15% you don't get, is it just pretty random? Or is there some specific application that's more difficult to defend?","Martin B. Anstice","I was going to be really cute and say the consistent theme is we weren't good enough or someone else was better. But I guess what I would tend to conclude as a summary here is that a big part of the focus of the company, a big part of the strength of the company has been in and around the more critical applications in the fab. And so when we do have a defense exposure, it's much more likely to be in a noncritical space. And there's a reason why the commercial dialogue becomes more relevant there. But in the long term, our belief is still the same today as it was 5 years ago or 10 years ago, that if we focus on critical applications, our cycles of learning will be greater than anybody else's, and we will continue to be able to succeed to the ambition we're speaking to.","Shanye Hudson","And we have time -- Oh, I'm sorry. I was going to say I believe we have time for 2 more questions.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up question on the win at the leading logic company. I was just wondering, Martin, if you could share any color on what kind of a ramp in shipments and sales we might think about at this new customer. Is it more of a sales ramp 2 to 3 years from now? Is that kind of how we should consider modeling?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I'm kind of sorry I can't share too much with you. It's a production tool. So that means it's part of an active production buy.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then as a follow-up question, just a follow-up on the possibility of paying the dividend. Does Ernie's decision to leave Lam impact the timing of the board's decision on the dividend? Can Lam or does Lam need to find a permanent CFO first? Or can the dividend discussion and decision be made with the search ongoing?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, as much as Ernie is a tremendously important component to our company, there is no relationship to a decision on capital structure and whether he is here or someone else is here. I mean, we don't want to kind of dump a surprise on somebody, but we're not going to do that. So we will, as a company, make the right decision at the right time with support from our board of directors independent of individuals and individual transitions.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.","Christopher Rand Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Martin, I had a question about this win at your leading logic customer. And it really comes down to although you just announced the win, you've probably been spending money on this for maybe over a year. So I wanted to understand the leverage on the OpEx going forward as revenue from that customer ramps. And is the business big enough and is the leverage large enough that we'll actually see it in the financial model?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, the operating -- the answer to the question is yes, I think you'll see it in the financial model. We certainly will see it in that we have more access to information, I guess. But the commentary from Ernie at the analyst meeting, which we repeated again today, speaks to the leverage in the company, the operating expense levels in the company, the targeted profitability levels in the company. So I -- you shouldn't be kind of like separating the 2 conversations. They're part of the same.","Christopher Rand Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question I had is related to the CFO replacement. Are you likely to look for someone internal inside Lam? Or do you -- is this an external search?","Martin B. Anstice","We have an active search today. We have a really talented finance organization and a great team and we're blessed with that, but we have decided, given the scale and scope of the company and our needs, an active search is an appropriate conclusion.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.

Good day and welcome to the Lam Research Corporation December 2017 Conference Call.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Satya Kumar, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Satya Kumar","Yes, thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Martin Anstice, Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, we will share our outlook on the business environment; review our financial results for the December 2017 quarter, and our outlook for the March 2018 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon.

And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","With that, let me hand the call over to Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thank you, Satya, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I will now provide an overview of December quarter results, summarize calendar 2017 relative to the multiyear outperformance opportunity for Lam, and provide a first outlook for 2018. As previously noted, we plan a comprehensive Investor Analyst events in a few weeks and so our prepared comments today are crafted in that context.","The December quarter was a strong conclusion to an extraordinary year with record performance for Lam reported in shipments, revenues, and non-GAAP EPS. As noted in our earnings release, that positive momentum is expected to continue into calendar 2018 with our March quarter guidance indicating mid-point shipments at $3.175 billion and revenues at $2.85 billion, both levels of strategic relevance and levels of business not previously seen in our history. While scaling the company at essentially a 50% pace in calendar 2017 was not our expectation one year ago, competitive business model flexibility and a commitment from our employees to the success of our customers was everything about how we responded to the incremental opportunities presented.","Without the tremendous effort of the team, and the supports of our customers and partners globally, these accomplishments would not be possible. It is my privilege to acknowledge this great work and express my personal gratitude. At the same time, it's important to reinforce the prominence of our culture and values and specifically our focus on increasing customer trust and codependency through the delivery of enabling technology, productivity, and speed now and in the years ahead.","As an established multi-product and services company delivering results on wafer to the semiconductor industry through complex systems engineering innovation, our primary objective is to promote our customer success through an increased proportion of their spending that we actively compete for and through differentiation to win and sustain more of that business over time.","In 2017, our reported shipments were approximately 21% of WFE versus 18.5% in the prior year and that compares with 14.2% in the first full-year after the Lam Novellus merger in 2013.","Reflecting on 2017, Lam delivered a remarkable sixth consecutive calendar year of growth and industry outperformance, a by-product of high quality strategies and execution jointly with our customers. Over that period, Lam has grown shipments by a cumulative annual growth rate of 24% approximately three times the rate of WFE growth.","In 2017, through a commitment to invest more in our future and to sustain the economic success for our customers and suppliers in partnership with Lam, we grew our shipments by approximately 50% well above WFE growth of 30% and reported record non-GAAP earnings per share of over $13 almost double the prior year.","With fundamental industry trends that we believe provides a platform for sustainable semiconductor ecosystem investments and growth, we remain focused on making the necessary investments in our company to increase the probability of achieving our long-term vision and we plan for another expansion in the proportion of WFE that we actively compete for and win in 2018, said differently, we plan for continued outperformance.","2017 recorded more than two percentage points of shipments based share gains across the equipment segments that we serve. Our market share performance was broad-based with strengths coming from areas that are most critical to the success of our customers with a focus on technology enablements across the full suites of industry inflections anticipated as relevant for our customers for the next five to 10 years.","We had very strong momentum in atomic layer deposition products which has been a focus area for new product introductions for several years. We more than tripled our shipments of ALD products in 2017. We had record shipments in dielectric etch with more than a tripling of the installed base to over 1,000 process modules for our Flex G Series products which address the most challenging aspects of 3D NAND scaling. We had a record year for conductor etch with application wins across foundry and NAND markets.","We strengthened our position in tungsten CVD and ALD as well as electrical deposition. We had a strong year for clean products with a 50% growth in our EOS clean product installed base.","As you know, broadening our customer base has been a key part of our strategy in the last decade and we are pleased to see it deliver results, with record shipments in logic for the year. Strength here was driven both by ramp of etch application wins at leading edge Logic as well as trailing edge Logic shipments to a broad set of customers for IoT applications. There should be no question about the fundamental relevance of the Lam product portfolio in etch and deposition to the device architecture and manufacturing processes planned by our customers broadly now and in the long-term.","We have much more comprehensive engagements across all device segments than ever before creating a platform of learning and optionality that enhances our competitive differentiation and the quality of our earnings. Increased strategic relevance to our customer success creates expectations and also significant opportunity for the company not least relative to the performance of more than 50,000 Lam processed chambers in the global semiconductor installed base today.","Our Customer Service Business Group grew profitable revenues in 2017 faster than the pace of our installed base growth. More importantly, they took us to the over the delivery of a portfolio of productivity solutions that we believe created more value for the customer and enhanced competitiveness of Lam than in any prior year.","Over the last decade, Lam has transitioned from an edge company highly levered to memory customers to a multi-product and services company with broader customer exposure across all device segments. That transition speaks to the quality of technology leadership. It speaks to cycles of learning and also business momentum.","As device performance is increasingly driven by adoption of new structures and new materials, as the traditional scaling solutions are limited by physics or economics in high volume manufacturing, enhancing our edge clean and deposition portfolio with disruptive and value creating technology is a strong focus. Illustratively, shipments for new memory solutions which have extremely demanding requirements more than tripled for Lam in 2017.","Our strategy for differentiation extends well beyond technology enablement for unit process and co-optimized or integrated products. Our fundamentally collaborative culture and values create an unmatched potential as a participants in the semiconductor ecosystem we are committed to harness the holistic value of Lam for the benefit of all stakeholders.","Now turning to the overall equipment spending trends of 2017 and our expectations for 2018. We believe that WFE investments in 2017 ended at a little over $47 billion which was up approximately 30% from the prior year. Slightly more than half of the investments made in 2017 were for memory and were weighted primarily towards NAND flash. Semiconductors are fundamental to enabling the generation, transmission, storage, and analysis of increasing quantities of data which has the potential to transform every segments of the global economy.","We remain optimistic about the potential for continued global economic stability and growth. We anticipate healthy demand for semiconductors across the full spectrum of consumer and enterprise markets.","We expect year-over-year growth in overall WFE in 2018 in the low-double-digit percentages led by DRAM and logic investments and supported by the fundamental demand drivers for silicon and the confidence we have in the continued motivation for investment discipline by all key market participants. We still anticipate that approximately 85% of the year-over-year spending growth is memory based.","Preliminarily, we plan for double-digit growth in overall memory WFE in 2018 with a greater balance between DRAM and NAND spending that was true in calendar 2017. Sustained to slightly increased investments in NAND overall is the year-over-year headline for 2018. More of the incremental growth is from DRAM where supply and demand balance tightened last year. Importantly, in DRAM, technology trends are resulting in meaningfully higher levels of investments required to drive similar levels of bit supply growth compared to historical levels.","We do expect a modest market demand led expansion of the wafer starts per month installed base in DRAM particularly supporting data center, content expansion, and we are aligned to the consensus view on bit growth in both markets.","On the demand side, NAND continues to be increasingly qualified into the data center and density not units increases; continue to be the important driver for clients mobile and PC devices.","We continue to see Lam's addressable markets, net of customer yields and productivity in NANDs growing faster than NANDs WFE as customers' transition from 64 layers to 96 layer investments starting late in 2018 and into 2019.","We expect growth in non-memory CapEx led primarily by Logic investments in both leading edge 10-nanometer as well as trailing edge 28-nanometer and above investments offset by flat to slightly lower investments in leading edge foundry from reuse among other strategies.","As I headlined, 2018 looks to be a very solid year of demand led equipment investments by our customers within the exciting context of increased prominence of silicon as a foundation of global innovation and presence enhanced opportunity for Lam.","Now I would like to touch briefly on the topic of capital allocation in light of the passage of recent U.S. tax reform legislation. Doug, will address more details later, but at a high level, the guiding principles for capital allocation at Lam remain unchanged.","First and foremost, invest in the long-term profitable growth of Lam, deliver increased optionality to create value from the strengths of Lam with accretive investments in our core and non-core markets, then return excess cash to our shareholders through strategies that include sustaining and growing dividends over time and excess capital redistribution to shareholders as appropriate.","We are obviously inspired by our opportunity and proud of our operational execution to-date.","On this last subject of tax, it is worth emphasizing that we implemented a comprehensive global strategy in 2003, as such, we have compelling value created from this recent legislative action. Illustratively, strategic optionality is accelerated with cash available to U.S. operations increasing from $1 billion to $5 billion. In the hypothetical events of 100% U.S. repatriation, we saved $1 billion of cash from the tax rates previously applicable.","85% of our gross cash balances are now available for repatriation and that represents $25 per share or 12% of the Lam share price currently. How much and when we repatriate and plans for capital allocation are framed by a broad set of strategic choices, which we will discuss in our upcoming Investor and Analyst Meeting.","Unrelated, you will have seen another announcement today about Lam leadership, specifically the promotion of Tim Archer, our Chief Operating Officer to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer. This promotion is recognition of Tim's contributions so far on the journey of Lam and it is a commentary on the partnership that we continue to share.","Except for some tweaks in emphasis, our fundamental responsibilities will remain unchanged, our commitment and passion for seeing Lam realize its full potential only strengthens. The full complement of global leaders at Lam have made possible our vision. Tim and I both look forward to the challenges and opportunities in the years ahead.","In conclusion, we're optimistic about our opportunity, our strategies, and the potential for continued outperformance for Lam. We look forward to sharing more aspects of our vision with you in March.","With that, let me turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Okay, great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today.","We ended calendar year 2017 with strong performance exceeding the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter on all of our financial metrics. In addition to the milestones that Martin mentioned during his scripted remarks, during calendar year 2017, we generated over $2 billion in cash from operations, that was an increase of 37% compared to calendar year 2016, and we returned $2.193 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases as well as dividends.","We're very pleased with what we've achieved this quarter as well as this calendar year. Shipments continued at a healthy level in the December quarter totaling $2,000,632 which was a little above the midpoint of our guidance. Memory shipments increased in the quarter with the combined memory segment representing 77% of total system shipments and that compares with 66% in the previous quarter.","Customers continue to ramp NAND and other non-volatile memory technologies which made up 53% of the system shipments. This was up from the 49% level that we saw in the September quarter.","The NAND investments were directed towards meeting increased bit demand through a combination of capacity additions, 2D to 3D conversions, as well as 3D installed base layer count growth.","DRAM shipments made up 24% of the system shipments and this was up from 17% in prior quarter. This was the highest dollar value of DRAM system shipments since the March 2015 quarter. Strong DRAM pricing supports these investments which continue to be largely directed towards 1X Nanometer convergence.","December quarter foundry shipments were 15% of system shipments, down from 21% in the prior quarter. Foundry spending was primarily directed towards 7-nanometer pilot capability as well as 10-nanometer volume production projects.","And finally, the logic and other segment accounted for 8% of system shipments that was down compared with 13% in the last quarter.","Revenues for the quarter came in at $2.581 billion above the midpoint of guidance and up 4% from the previous record high level that we saw in the September quarter.","Gross margin came in at 47.6%. As I always mentioned you should expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in gross margins due to multiple factors such as product mix, customer concentration, and overall business volumes.","Operating expenses in December quarter increased to $449 million coming in at 17.4% of revenue that compares with 17.7% in September. Approximately 63% of the OpEx spend in the quarter was allocated to R&D which was around the same ratio as we've held for the calendar year.","While we continue to see opportunities to further leverage OpEx, we will continue to increase our funding of strategic R&D programs to maintain our technology as well as productivity leadership. These investments are critical to meeting our commitments to customers and to our objective of growing the company at a faster pace than the industry.","The growth and the size of our served available markets and the market share gains that Martin mentioned are the result of investments we've made and work that we've done over the course of the last several years.","Operating income in the December quarter was $779 million, which was up from $733 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin came in at 30.2%, up compared to 29.6% in the September quarter and again a little above the midpoint of the guided range.","Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately negative 1% down compared to 14% last quarter. The primary reason for the reduction in the non-GAAP tax rate is a reduced statutory U.S. rate combined with a delayed implementation of U.S. tax and foreign earnings. This is attributed to the application of the recently enacted tax changes for a non-calendar year filing. The new tax law applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, which for Lam will be in the second half of 2018 onwards.","Excluded from the non-GAAP tax rate is a one-time charge of $757 million. This is primarily made up of tax on accumulated foreign earnings to be repatriated.","The cash tax payments will be made over the next eight years. The tax rate in the mid-single-digits for the first half of 2018 and mid-teens in the second half of 2018 would be reasonable for you to include in your models.","Based on a share count of about 182 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter totaled $4.34 above the high-end of our guided range. The biggest contributor to the earnings per share being above the range was the favorable impact on the tax rate.","Without the impact of the tax rate change, we would have been approximately $0.10 above the midpoint of guidance. The share count includes approximately 18 million shares of dilutive impact on a non-GAAP basis from the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes.","And I just mentioned with the increase in our stock price, we've continued to receive requests for early conversions of both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes. Conversions that settled in December quarter totaled $44 million of which $32 million related to the 2018 convert and $12 million to the 2041 bond. To-date, we've also received requests for conversions totaling $175 million that will settle in the March quarter.","And I will remind you dilution schedules for the updated notional amounts in the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with your modeling.","We continue to execute on our capital return program. As you may recall, we announced in November, a new $2 billion buyback authorization. In the December quarter, we spent approximately $1.1 billion on share repurchases largely through an accelerated share repurchase program. And we paid out $73 million in dividends to our shareholders. Consistent with our prior comments we're committed to growing the dividend over time and in November we also announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share which was payable earlier this month.","Now we move to the balance sheet. During December quarter we initiated a $1.25 billion commercial paper program and as of the end of the December quarter we had $800 million outstanding. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments including restricted cash of about $6 billion. Approximately $5 billion of the $6 billion was domiciled outside of the United States. This is the amount that comes more flexibly available with tax reform.","Cash from operations was $29 million, down from $858 million in the September quarter. The low cash generation during the quarter was a result of the timing of certain receivables as well as a growth in inventory to support the strong shipments we see in the March quarter. And I would just mention we collected approximately $700 million at the end of December which was after our fiscal quarter had closed.","Day sales outstanding increased to 80 days versus 56 last quarter. Inventory turns came in at 3.6 compared to 4 in the prior quarter and I just mentioned I expect the March quarter will be a very strong cash generating quarter.","Deferred revenue at the end of a quarter were $1.114 billion which was up from $938 million last quarter. This number excludes $289 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. And I just remind you that these Japan shipments remain as inventory carrying cost on the balance sheet.","I should mention that we will be adopting the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 starting in the second half of calendar year 2018 to coincide with the start of our fiscal year 2019. I have more to tell you about this as we get closer to the second half of the year.","Company non-cash expenses during the quarter include the following: $42 million for equity compensation, $41 million for amortization, and $39 million for depreciation.","Capital expenditures were $85 million which was up from $60 million in the September quarter. This growth was driven by factory and lab expansions as well as lab tool investments.","CapEx for the year came in at $224 million. We do expect to see a further increase in CapEx in calendar year 2018, as we continue to expand our manufacturing network and support growth in strategic R&D programs.","We ended the quarter with approximately 10,200 regular full time employees. Majority the headcount was added in the factory and field to support the growth of our business. As Martin mentioned in his remarks, company is enjoying significant business momentum heading into the March quarter.","Our non-GAAP guidance for the quarter is as follows: we're expecting shipments of $3.175 billion plus or minus $125 million. We're forecasting revenue of $2.850 billion again plus or minus $125 million. We're forecasting gross margin of 46% plus or minus one percentage point. I do expect to see a stronger gross margin percentage in the June quarter as compared to March.","We're forecasting operating margins of 29% plus or minus one percentage point and finally, we forecast earnings per share of $4.35 plus or minus $0.15 based on a share count of approximately 181 million shares.","Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to provide an update on our plans for Analyst Day. We will be hosting this event on Tuesday, March 6, in New York City. We will be providing additional details regarding the event logistics in the next week or so.","And for 2018, we continue to be pleased with the positive momentum in our business and the progress we're making towards our ongoing business objectives. We remain optimistic in the strong demand for our products and services and we look forward to sharing a comprehensive update on the company's plans at our Analyst Day in March.","Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","And we'll take our first question from C. J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.","C. J. Muse","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide some help around that the cost down efforts in the NAND market. And so as you think about moving from single-stack to multi-stack QLC perhaps some other techniques that you're helping your customers met with. We would love to hear how you think about the bit guys and their ability to drive down their costs such that the hard disk drive market becomes achievable to penetrate? That would be very helpful.","Martin Anstice","My, that's a comprehensive question, C.J. So maybe I should start with our assumption that we communicated in the Analyst Meeting a year ago. We actually when we articulated our perspective on the opportunity for Lam and we gave this reference to $70 billion of investments. Our assumption was actually that SSD would not be disruptive to hard disk drives. Our assumption was that the demand for storage and memory in the world would essentially be serviced by this new mode of nonvolatile memory, all these new product with nonvolatile memory. And then hard disk drives would just kind of be kind of caped out that was the modeling assumption that we presented to you.","So to the extent the scenario plays out in the way you articulate it, you should presume that's kind of upside to the commentary of the company because of what I just said. Obviously NAND is probably the poster child for a market with elasticity of demand. And the industry has universally adopted a new technology and it is scaling that new technology in terms of playing the 3D transitions and layer counts.","And when our customers make investments they make it because they have performance enhancements on device and they have cost roadmaps that creates opportunities for incremental demand to get kind of created. So there's an awful lot I could say about the subject, the headlines that I hope everybody retains here is we think the world of silicon and we think the world of nonvolatile memory specifically has tremendous opportunity in the years ahead as a byproduct of this innovation that's emerged around the value of data in the world. And the good use of Lam from a lot of hard work and a lot of partnerships with our customers we position the portfolio of products and a product pipeline that's focused on enabling that roadmap.","C. J. Muse","That's helpful. Appreciate, it. And I guess as a follow-up as you think about your 1.7 times outperformance in 2017 and it looks like mix is going to be there for you again in 2018 would love to hear your thoughts in terms of how whether you can rank order or not, how you think about perhaps gains in share and logic service growth and other areas where you're seeing increased patterning that will drive faster than expected industry growth for you guys we'd love to hear thoughts on that? Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thank you. Appreciate the question C.J. and maybe I can just restate something I said in my prepared remarks because it's a very important disclosure from the company relative to our focus, our definition of success, and our priority. And I share that because I have some anxiety that the investment community gets trapped in fairly incomplete disclosure from the totality of the industry on market share hence our focus.","So our focus is the following. Our primary objective is to promote our customer success through an increased proportion of their spending that we actively compete for and through differentiation to win and sustain more of that business over time. That means that our focus at a product line level and a business unit level and a segment level has to be on the share that we have but what really counts is where that share is and our focus is on the most critical applications, that most value to applications for our customers, and the sustainability of that share through the economics that were associated with it.","And the most basic measure of performance for any company in any market is the one that I characterized and we will continue to answer these questions on market share by a focus around that kind of basis. And our headline for last year was 21% of WFE against 18.5% in prior year against 14.2% in the year, the first year after bringing Lam and Novellus together. So momentum is really good. The technology inflections still have tremendous opportunity for us, more or less the headlines that we communicated in NAND flash at the Analyst Meeting are only I would say a little better one-year on and we'll spend more time talking about that in a few weeks.","And in the world of patterning, I think the headlines that we communicated in our Analyst Meeting a year ago are as valid today as they were then. And that includes the various scenarios of adoption of EUV and that includes the various technology advancements that have played out since that time in multi-patterning process flow.","Satya Kumar","Thanks C.J.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Romit Shah","Yes, thank you and congratulations. The March shipment numbers obviously a very big number and I feel like there could be some skepticism around that shipment number and how strong it is and whether or not that's really sustainable and so I was hoping you could comment on just if we look throughout the year and just triangulate between the outperformance you delivered in 2017 and your outlook for low-double-digit WFE growth this year it would seem like the March shipment guidance is a number that you could sustain throughout the year, I wanted to get your feedback on that?","Martin Anstice","Yes, I mean we're obviously we're not in the game of guiding every quarter of the year or even the year with any specificity but to the spirit of your question, I hope there isn't skepticism around the quarter itself because I hope at this point we've got a track record of actually delivering on the kind of quarters commitments relative to sustainability. Obviously this is all about fundamental demand and if you sign up for if you sign up for the conventions that I described in my prepared comments, the convention that silicon has established itself quite differently in terms of potential and work data, then you would sign up for sustainability of investment.","Now you might get ebbs and flows one quarter after another or one month but the fundamental headline that we believe in and we're investing to create value in is a scenario of sustained and disciplined investment by our customers at a more discrete level just to put some more substance on it for you, our expectation is that relative calendar 2018 we see it is not perfectly but a reasonably balanced year for the industry and for the company both.","And I would say that we see memory could be slightly first half biased and foundry could be slightly second half biased, with Logic as fairly neutral in the year. And as was proven last year, everything I just said to be entirely wrong and probably is precisely wrong but it's the best we have for you today in terms of trying to give you some color around quarter-to-quarter or half-to-half.","Romit Shah","I appreciate it. I'm curious just as my follow-up how China plays into your forecast for this year because there's obviously a lot going on between domestic and global and memory and foundry is how does China play into your outlook?","Martin Anstice","Yes. So the China -- obviously for the domestic community and the global players that are investing there is a big deal and the headlines in terms of new fab projects are exactly the same today as they were three months ago when I detailed them the only incremental disclosure today obviously is there are more projects that we're tracking.","But when we look at WFE investments in calendar 2018, we think that the domestic community combines all segments, so the domestic community in China DRAM, flash, and logic foundry, probably invest slightly less than $5 billion which is a little less than 10% of global WFE and the way we've described it to you and that's up between $1 billion and $2 billion maybe $1.5 billion compared to that kind of the 2017.","So it's an increasingly important component of spending, it's a big focus for us in terms of building infrastructure, supporting our customer success, and their visions and putting in place qualified people to support them.","One last piece of data relative to our shipments when we look at the Lam shipments in China two-thirds of the shipment dollars will be probably for the global players investing their one-third for the domestic community.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini","Well thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to some of the structural changes especially with 3D NAND. I want to get your view how we should think about migration from 64 to 96 and in that context with the new fab and a change in layout have any impact in architecture especially as the 3D NAND could lead to higher manufacturing cycle time. So perhaps a new clean room could help with that versus converting existing planar NAND. Is there anything or any changes between these two sort of variables that we should add to our thesis?","Martin Anstice","Yes, I mean I don't know I would characterize the kind of line layout complexities from 64 to 96 much differently I would from the other versions that have preceded this and I don't think I would characterize it as more challenging or complex than a planar to 3D conversion.","But I think your question is a very important one and you know there are I would say fairly dynamic customer plans around how best they service the opportunities in the marketplace that they see and we would expect to continue to see this portfolio of investments from clean Greenfields to the planar to 3D scaling and 3D scaling vertically itself.","We are as we've said number of times we're agnostic actually in terms of the opportunity between the planar 3D conversion and the new fab addition from a business perspective and I would expect based on what I know today that somewhere in the range of two-thirds of the investment by the industry is conversion related and maybe a third is additions. But that's a proxy that will change for sure as discrete opportunities for sure for customers and as they optimize their plans.","Mehdi Hosseini","Sure. And then and just quickly as a follow-up as we think about the longer-term, how should we think about the service component especially with some of the new areas like ALD would that carry different service attach rate versus the rest and I know Analyst Day is coming up but is there anything you can share with us?","Martin Anstice","Yes, probably it's a way to the Analyst Meeting and there are some very important headlines I think for the company around the pace of growth in excess of the installed base and the product portfolio and the segments that we're growing are part of that story, the emphasis that we're investing in around advanced services is part of that story and I think there's something quite unique about where we are in the ecosystem that presents opportunity as well. So it's definitely an increasingly valuable annuity to the company and it's an increasingly important part of creating and delivering value to our customers.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. I wonder if you could characterize the service and supplies business and it seems like that's been consistently holding the same proportion of your overall revenue. Is how is that business kind of growing as fast as the systems business and how sustainable do you think that growth is?","Martin Anstice","It's actually been growing faster than the installed base which is a kind of a statement of the breadth of the product and services portfolio that we're making available to our customers and we're investing and creating and dialogues around our social intelligence and machine learning are as relevant inside of our company and is relevant in terms of developing products and services for our customers, as it is for our customers and ensuring their customers and the consumers.","So don't disconnect the AI and the big data analytics headlines from the realities of our company as well. So it's a broadening portfolio, it's growing fast in installed base and in a periods where we've had extraordinary growth in our systems business, it's a testament to the strengths of our Customer Service Business Group that we have we're able to say what we're saying and preserve in essence the same percentage of revenues coming from that business.","Now what that means in terms of modeling purposes, if you happen to choose best, you're going to model less growth in calendar 2018 than was true in 2017 which is essentially what we've guided. Then the value of that installed base business kind of goes up over time. So I think it\u2019s a great commentary on value, sustainability, and quality of earnings.","Doug Bettinger","And Joe I always tell you it's my favorite part about the company's business model is just it's an annuity that just keeps going, keeps growing, keeps generating enormous amounts of cash it's a great part of what we do.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari","Great, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. And Martin, I had a question on UV. I guess as we approach the timing of insertion particularly in the foundry space and you learn more about the recipe that your customer might follow. Has your view on your opportunity set, as it relates to patterning changed over the past six or 12 months or has it remained kind of the same?","Martin Anstice","It's remained the same.","Toshiya Hari","Okay, fair enough. And the second one on the tax rate, Doug, I think you guided fiscal year second half the tax rate to kind of the mid-teens. Should we consider that rate as the new normal for the company or should we expect some variability going forward post tax put planning or whatever maybe.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Toshi, if I was modeling out beyond the second half of 2018 I'd probably keep it pretty steady with what I gave you which is mid-teens for the second half. But it always changes a little bit depending on where the geographic distribution of our business ebbs and flows, so it's not going to be precisely that, but that would be the best planning horizon or the planning number that I'll give you. And just to remind make sure everybody heard first half of calendar 2018 mid-single-digits, second half, mid-teens.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse.","Martin Anstice","Farhan, I think you are on mute.","Farhan Ahmad","Hello, can you hear me?","Martin Anstice","Yes, we can hear you now. Go ahead.","Farhan Ahmad","So my first question is on memory and NAND DRAM. What level of bit growth do you expect from the CapEx outlook that you have for the year?","Martin Anstice","I think we kind of signed up for the consensus on bit growth. So the low 20s for DRAM and mid to high 40s for NAND for calendar 2018 and obviously the server phone content in DRAM is a decent kind of content headline and the same is true for the Smartphone bit growth for NAND. And I think one of the illustrative headlines that we should all be conscious of is the average Smartphone today is got maybe 4 gigs of NAND content and the best phones have 256 -- 40 I'm sorry I should have said 40 gigs of content and the best one is 256.","So when you think about applications innovation and you think about the content headlines not the unit headlines that's one of the most fundamental drivers for the business prospectively. ","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. And then one question on the services you have very strong growth in your systems business this year. Does that mean that we should see much stronger growth in your services business over next year, one year as these systems come off warranty?","Martin Anstice","Well, I'll say the objective of the company, as we said many, many times is to grow the service business the spares and service and upgrades business faster than we do the installed base. And you're right to say there are warranties and so when warranty periods end and you roll into that space and we try to position for very, very strong market share and sustainability. So I would tend to lean towards a very positive answer to your question.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and congratulations on the well executed quarter and the outstanding performance in 2017. You guys have given great leverage on the OpEx with the scale and the revenue growth. If we assume that WFE is sustainable above 40, 45 billion plus kind of going forward, seems like 28% to 30% up margin plus or minus seems sustainable. So more and more investors are focused on free cash flow and free cash flow margin so how should we think about the sustainable free cash flow margin at say the 28% to 30% operating margin level?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Harlan, we're front-running an update to the model which we will give you in early March. But generally speaking we would expect operating cash flow to be close to operating income.","Now if you look at what happened in the last year the business grew so rapidly that we actually did less well than that because the consumption of working capital as the business scaled up we needed to build more inventory, receivables grew along with the level of revenue so we didn't do quite as well as that. But on a ongoing basis assuming kind of a steady state of business shipments and revenue that's about where we should be. Our CapEx is nominally 3% to 4% of revenues so that's your free cash flow answer there.","Harlan Sur","Got it. Thanks for the insights there. And shipments are up 40% in December versus the year ago quarter versus two years ago there will be up strongly again in March. Obviously my congrats to the operations, logistics, and manufacturing teams but just given the significant strength in the [indiscernible] are customer lead times increasing and anyway to quantify the increase?","Martin Anstice","Yes, way to qualify everything but we don't disclose lead times for obvious competitive reasons in respect for the roadmaps of our customers. But what I will tell you is obviously it takes a lot of work to do what we're doing it's much more difficult. And I think for an industry. I think we've for those of us that have participated in the scale of growth that we have, we've all been very challenged by that scale of growth.","But I would say that from a benchmarking perspective as best I can tell which is why I spoke to kind of flexible business model and commitment from employees in my prepared comments, we've executed as well if not better than most or maybe all. So it's a big focus, it's get more difficult and certainly 50% growth here is a quite extraordinary challenges for operations and also field resources.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, I'm always amazed Harlan when I sit for the quarterly business reviews with the supply chain, the global operations team, as well as the field, just how well they're executing. It's been actually quite amazing when you see how it's all happened.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.","Sidney Ho","Well thanks for taking my question. My question is the first question is on DRAM. There has been a lot of chatters that the strong DRAM that the market expects and what you alluded to for next year could be because of capital intensity of DRAM going up but it could also be yields on suboptimal what is your view on that?","Martin Anstice","Well my basic view is I don't think customers spend money if a yield is suboptimal. I think that's a very important kind of test for them making their investments and I guess that's all relative. I mean we have characterized obviously today that the relative investments the industry has to make are a little higher for a bit outs in the context of the technology conversions that are playing out today in this year compared to last year and the year before.","But I would also make the point that it's still an investment that is dominated by conversion. And it is still an investment that is made with extraordinary discipline by our customers managing supply and demand balance. And I would also say that the capital intensity data point is actually a lot less than the points in history that have triggered kind of corrections so I think if you look at kind of memory today, the capital intensity for the last four years including the outlook for calendar 2018 is not even two-thirds of the level seen in 2007, so it's a dramatically different profile of risk.","Sidney Ho","Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up question is if you look at your forecast for WFE, what are some of the biggest swing factors in your forecast that can move above or below your forecast of low-teens; just want to see if I can get something out you to be more precisely wrong?","Martin Anstice","No, Sidney, I appreciate that and good luck with that. Well I mean macro positive negative is always there and always will be -- this is a pretty extraordinary time for the industry I think holistically because there's an irony here of consolidated participants and a diversified kind of statement of demand. So I guess may be more difficult not more easy to forecast the future at a device to my level. You have an industry that is I think singularly invested and try to take advantage of this opportunity and contribute to broader tech economy and broader innovation. And so, it's all about creating incremental demand and the memory, storage, datacenter, AI, Big Data Analytics advanced process, I mean it's all relevant.","Right, I mean we live in a world where devices and silicon that support connectivity are critical to the roadmap. Devices that create the capacity to store efficiently and cost effectively all that collected data are critical. And the high performance computing that is relevant to take all of that data and do something with it that creates value either in an enterprise or in a consumer context has to kind of show up.","So I think it's a very integrated system which is perhaps why I answer the question may be less precisely than you would like me to because I think we live in a world where this is much less about discrete segments of a semiconductor industry as we traditionally described it and much more about the integration of technologies from a chip integration point of view, from an embedded memory and logic solutions perspective, we live in the world of systems, designed systems architecture and it all has to be there and all is part of answering this question around incremental opportunity or incremental risk.","Operator","We will take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.","Craig Ellis","Yes thanks for taking that question. Martin, I appreciate the comments on the positioning for 2018's memory spending and DRAM starting to catch-up and balance with NAND. Could you extend your view a little bit further and comment on maybe the multi-year trend for DRAM, I know the company's typically been comfortable talking about longer-term such as your five-year NAND spending piece. So could you give us a longer term look with what you see at DRAM?","Martin Anstice","I thought you started with NAND and you ended with DRAM.","Doug Bettinger","He kind of boomeranged.","Martin Anstice","Which one do you want to talk about?","Craig Ellis","DRAM. NAND was simply used as an example of --","Martin Anstice","Okay, okay.","Craig Ellis","Kind of in the past for the longer-term deals.","Martin Anstice","The first thing I'd say it's a content story not a unit story. I don't think we're going to stand up and say hey we got this great view that all of a sudden PC units and software units take off again because I don't think that's the headline.","It's all about content and there are two drivers of bit growth in DRAM one of them is the server which is the most comprehensive demand driver and the second is expansion of phone contents. And we are, I would say, I'd probably be stronger than conservatively optimistic I'd say we're optimistic about those long-term trends and we think they're fundamental to answering the questions about investments in silicon capacity and the investment we make in a business.","Craig Ellis","That's helpful and then the follow-up I'll shoot it over to Doug. Doug as you look at the company and the flexibility that you have now with cash, can you talk about what that means for debt levels and capital structure and if we should expect that that would stay at current levels or if there's potential for whatever reason for debt to rise from here as a percent of your capital structure. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Craig. I'm going to decline to answer that one but I will promise you that when we get to the March Analyst Day we will have lots more to tell you as you might appreciate all the tax changes are kind of late breaking we're talking internally about it debating some things. We'll have more to tell you know in our remarks from and I'm going to punt on this one for now.","Craig Ellis","Can I take a swing at another one then?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, go ahead.","Craig Ellis","Okay, I'll pop it back to Martin. Martin, this is more of a -- maybe I'll have better success more of a qualitative question. I'm interested in knowing the degree to which your discussions with customers have changed over the last few years as capital intensity is stepped up dramatically and as there's more signs that industry is on a steadier growth profile rather than boom\/bust what's changed with the duration of the discussion the way that you may be collaborating across different types of technologies etcetera.","Martin Anstice","Yes, I mean actually maybe that last kind of sub question is actually a great response. I mean I think the scale and scope of technical challenges and business challenges for everybody in this ecosystem is much more difficult today than was true five years ago. And the companies that I think excel and sustain in the long-term have attributes of partnership and collaboration and codependency that are quite fundamental and that's why almost every single quarter I see something like culture and values because that's a fundamental elements of competitive differentiation.","If you are not trusted if you are not legitimately collaborative, if you are not sincerely invested in the success of your customers then your opportunity to sustain your business is limited.","Operator","And it does conclude out question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Satya for any additional or closing remarks.","Satya Kumar","Yes, thank you once again for joining us. And we look forward to seeing you at our March Analyst Day in New York. We'll be sending you more details shortly on that. Thank you.","Operator","And once again that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you all for your participation. And you may now disconnect."],"12821":["Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 29, 2015  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Audrey Charles - IR","Martin Anstice - President and CEO","Doug Bettinger - EVP and CFO","Analysts","James Covello - Goldman Sachs","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities ","C.J.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Audrey Charles. Please go ahead.","Audrey Charles","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Conference Call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, we will share our outlook on the business environment and review our financial results for the June 2015 quarter and our outlook for the September 2015 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 PM this afternoon. It can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company's Web-site along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.","Today's presentation and Q&A will include statements about our expectations and beliefs regarding certain future outcomes, including our outlook.

As a reminder, a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our Web-site.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thank you, Audrey, and good afternoon everyone. We would like to thank those of you who attended or listened to our recent Investor and Analyst Event on July 14th in San Francisco. During that meeting, we described the drivers of our sustainable outperformance, reviewed our perspective on the industry, and updated our long-term financial model.","As that update was just two weeks ago, we will keep our prepared comments today brief starting first with a review of our June quarter and fiscal 2015 results followed by a brief recap of key messages we shared with you during our Analyst Event, then providing an update on our near term industry outlook including with a reinforcement of the unique SAM expansion story for Lam.","The June quarter reported results were in line with our expectations at or above midpoint for all guided metrics, and for the second straight quarter, we set records for revenue, shipments, and operating income. The June quarter marked the end of our 2015 fiscal year, a year where we surpassed the $5 billion level for shipments and revenues and generated more than $1 billion in operating income.","We demonstrated our commitment to long-term profitable growth and returned value to shareholders with a 16% growth in net income fiscal year-over-year and $630 million or three times increase year-over-year of returned value to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. It's important to note that the substance of the outperformance trends that we're demonstrating is based on technology and productivity leadership, strength and execution across the entire organization, the values and culture of our Company, and the support we have earned from our customers through our focus on customer trust and collaborations aimed at helping them solve their most difficult challenges.","As stated before, our opportunity to continue the outperformance trend is driven by a broad-based market participation in the now well-understood deposition and etch-intensive inflections of multi-patterning, 3D device architecture and advanced packaging.","Focusing on one element of that headline today, at our recent Investor Event we discussed how the patterning market for Lam likely grows through the 5-nanometer technology node with or without EUV. An important dynamic within this segment is the increasing relevance of spacer-based patterning. Spacer-based quadruple patterning as we illustrated in our Analyst Meeting can increase the number of deposition, etch, and clean passes up to five times driving the need for process variability control and cost reductions.","To address these challenges in logic and memory segments both, we are focused on delivering technically enabling capabilities at high levels of productivity such as the VECTOR ALD Oxide and Kiyo with Hydra technology products. With these offerings, we've been able to establish a very strong and we believe sustainable number one position in etch for multi-patterning and grow our ALD share dramatically in just a couple of years.","With our assumption that approximately 60% of old foundry logic patterning steps are spacer based at 7-nanometer, our leadership in this segment is illustrative of the value we have already been able to deliver to the customer, and more importantly the opportunity that lies ahead.","Now turning to the near-term industry update, with the second quarter of calendar 2015 concluded in line with our expectations, we continue to see discipline in the industry with recent puts and takes being directionally consistent with movements last quarter, i.e., strengthening in 3D NAND investments, foundry, and logic both slightly down.","Investments by our customers is supporting a very strong September for the Company as evidenced by our guidance today. Although it is way too early to guide 2015 December quarter shipments, a September outlook that is materially higher than most expectations, ours and yours, our comments at the recent Analyst Event combined with the last couple of weeks of general industry tone suggests we will likely see a December quarter with shipment levels lower than our 2015 March quarter.","In many respects, this is illustrative of the variability of business we described as the new challenge of the consolidated industry as the plans and investment decisions of any one customer or segment presents a more immediate and more significant short-term effect than ever before. With strong mid and long-term fundamentals for the Company and building deferred revenue balances in the first half of this year, we now expect slightly stronger revenues for the Company in the second half of 2015 compared with the first half 2015.","Overall, we maintain our view for calendar 2015 WFE investment of $34 billion, plus or minus $2 billion, and as is customary, we would add that our view is predicated on a healthy macro environment. We are encouraged by the opportunity we see for Lam in the industry. Investments appear rational across segments and are largely consistent with our understanding of capacity needs and reasonable assumptions on rising capital intensity. From our perspective, there are positive and broad-based emerging indicators for demand at the leading edge with increased device designs, tape outs, and new product penetrations, plans to take advantage of targeted performance and cost benefits available from latest device architecture and process flows.","In the DRAM segments, market's demand continues to be driven by mobile and enterprise DRAM growth. DRAM investments, which as we have said, are biased for the first half of calendar 2015, are very efficient and focused primarily on technology conversions to 20-nanometer. Investments appear to essentially keep the installed base wafer start level flat year-over-year with strong segment participation for Lam Research.","For NAND, 3D NAND momentum has continued to increase through the June quarter. As we recently stated, we now expect that shipped capacity for 3D NAND will be approximately 150,000 wafer starts by the end of calendar 2015 with perhaps slightly more than half this amount being qualified for HVM device outburst. Overall, we anticipate 2015 memory WFE spending at approximately the $16 billion level.","For the foundry segment, we continue to see that investments are focused on FinFET enablement at a number of customers. The previously noted 28-nanometer capacity additions this year continue to be a meaningful part of the foundry segment investments with healthy end demand. We reiterate our view that foundry investment will be slightly lower than the spending levels we saw in 2014.","We expect logic spending of between $6 billion and $7 billion, slightly down from 2014, reflecting a sustained commitment to technology conversions with optimized reuse of the installed base. As noted last quarter, strength in demand for image sensors driven by mobile communications and share gains for Lam has provided some upside in the logic segment for us.","Today, significant device technology migrations are fundamentally enabled by the most advanced deposition and etch intensive inflections of multi-patterning and 3D architecture which we aim to extend and make more productive for our customers each and every day. As we outlined at our recent Investor and Analyst Event, these inflections together with advanced packaging are driving what we now see as a $3 billion plus multiyear market expansion for Lam with multi-patterning and 3D NAND being the biggest opportunities, each representing approximately 40% of that total. We believe that continued execution of Lam combined with our market-leading deposition and etch positions in these segments is an undeniable relative and accelerating growth opportunity for the Company through 2018.","As we enter the second half of 2015, we are excited about the long-term opportunities ahead and sufficiently confident in our ability to execute to recently update our growth targets and long-term Lam financial model indicating the potential for $8 plus annual earnings per share within the next three years. It is an exciting time in the industry and from the perspective that we have, Lam is better positioned than most for growth through multiple segment inflections over a multiyear period.","Of course, being in a good position is not enough. Our focus on contributing to the long-term success of our customers must continue to be paramount, our ability to execute our opportunity only possible with commitments and hard work of more than 7,000 Lam employees worldwide who make this a special and rewarding place to work. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them all for their commitments and continued focus on industry excellence.","With that, I'll now hand the call to Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Okay. Thank you, Martin, and thank you to everyone for joining us on the call today. We have what I think are some strong results to share with you today for both the June quarter as well as for our just concluded 2015 fiscal year. So I'll go ahead and just get started going through the numbers.","It's an exciting time for Lam Research. We delivered record levels of shipments, revenues and operating income for the quarter and for the fiscal year. Each of these metrics achieved double-digit growth in the June quarter compared with the June quarter of last year. In the quarter, we performed at or above the midpoint of guidance for all of the metrics. And for the fiscal year we hit some impressive milestones crossing $5 billion in both revenue and shipments for the first time in our history and generating more than $1 billion in operating income, again for the first time. We believe these strong results and milestones clearly demonstrate solid execution against our opportunities.","Our upward trajectory of shipments continued in the June quarter with shipments coming in at $1.616 billion, which was up 8% sequentially and above the midpoint of the guided range. And as I just mentioned, shipments for the fiscal year topped the $5 billion mark.","As we expected coming into the quarter, memory shipments were flattish in dollar terms and declined slightly in percentage terms during the quarter. The combined memory segment paid up 60% of total system shipments and that compares with 67% in the prior quarter. DRAM shipments represented 37% of system shipments, which was down from 45% in the prior quarter. DRAM shipments were largely being driven by 20-nanometer conversion spending. NAND and other non-volatile memory accounted for 23% of shipments, which was flat with 22% in the March quarter. NAND investment in the quarter was primarily directed towards investments in 3D NAND.","Shipments to our foundry customers were at 26% of system shipments in the June quarter, which was up a little bit from 24% in the prior quarter. Foundry spending in June was a mix of FinFET investment as well as 28-nanometer capacity spending. The logic and other segment had a nice uptick accounting for 14% of system shipments compared with 9% last quarter. Strength here came from continuing investments in CMOS image sensors.","Record revenues for the quarter were at a level of $1.481 billion, which was an increase of 6% compared with the March quarter. For fiscal year 2015, the revenues of the Company also exceeded the $5 billion mark for the first time. You've consistently been hearing us talk about our strong position around the technology inflections and our differentiation in the marketplace. I think you can absolutely see that position reflected in our shipment and revenue outperformance.","Gross margin came in right at the midpoint of guidance at 45.5%, and as we shared with you in the past, we expect to see variability in gross margins on a quarterly basis as a function of a number of factors such as business volumes, product mix, particularly our newer products where we're still moving down the cost curve as well as relative levels of customer concentration.","Operating expenses in the June quarter grew a little bit to $355 million but decreased as a percentage of revenue to 24%, which was down from 25% in the March quarter. In the quarter, 63% of the OpEx spend went to R&D which was about the same level as last quarter. The top priority of the Company is to continue to fund R&D programs and infrastructure to enable the future growth of the Company. These ongoing investments are crucial to being ready for the current as well as next set of technology inflections. R&D is funding development of capabilities like our Flex G Series dielectric etcher, our VECTOR ALD Oxide systems as well as our Kiyo conductor etch systems.","Operating income in the June quarter was also at a record level coming in at $319 million, which was up over 15% from the prior quarter. Another first in the history of the Company, as I mentioned, operating income generated in fiscal year topped $1 billion. Operating margin in the quarter was 21.6% which was up from 19.9% in March and again above the midpoint of the guided range. Operating margin improved quarter over quarter with the growth in revenue along with the improvement in gross margin. And similar to my comments about gross margin, we expect to see variability in operating income with variability in gross margin as well as overall business levels.","The tax rate for the quarter was approximately 16%, which was up compared to 11% in the March quarter. A tax rate in the middle teens would be reasonable for you to continue to include in your financial models.","With share count of about 174 million shares, earnings per share for the June quarter were $1.50, above the midpoint of the guidance, driven by the higher revenue and the higher operating margin. The share count at this point includes dilution from all three of our convertible notes with the total dilutive impact of about 12 million shares of a non-GAAP basis. And I'll remind you that dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations Web-site for your reference.","We spent $59 million and took delivery of 754,000 shares at an average share price of $78.80 during the quarter. At the end of the quarter we had completed more than 60% of the current $850 million share repurchase authorization. We also returned $29 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders and during the quarter announced a 67% increase in the dividend level raising the dividend at $0.30 per share each quarter starting with the payment made earlier in the September quarter.","Let me now move to the balance sheet. Cash from operations was strong at $292 million, which was up from $191 million in the March quarter. During the quarter, cash and short-term investments including our restricted cash increased to $4.2 billion, up from $4.1 billion in March. The increase in the cash balance was primarily a result of the cash from operations, offset by those share repurchases and dividends as well as capital expenditures.","Day sales outstanding decreased a little bit to 67 days versus 68 days in March. And as we mentioned in the Investor Event, we recorded in the June quarter an impairment of goodwill and intangibles on the balance sheet primarily related to our clean business. The total impairment of $89 million are treated as one-time expenses and included in our non-GAAP adjustments for the June quarter.","At the end of the quarter, deferred revenues were $518 million, which was up from $485 million in March. This number excludes $164 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. And I'll just remind you that these Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on our balance sheet.","Company non-cash expenses during the quarter included the following; $40 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization and $31 million for depreciation. Capital expenditure was up a little bit to $63 million which was up from $32 million in the March quarter. Investments in the quarter were largely attributed to lab tool investments. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,200 regular full-time employees. And I'll just take a moment to mention that the growth in headcount you've been seeing from us over the last few quarters will level out as we go forward.","So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We're expecting shipments of $1.580 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Shipments will continue to be strong driven by 3D NAND. We're forecasting revenue of $1.6 billion, plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. We're forecasting operating margins of 22.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And I just point out, this operating margin includes some growth in spending that is of a discrete nature. I'd expect spending in the December quarter to come down somewhat from this level. And then finally we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.70, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 174 million shares.","Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Martin and I would be pleased to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello","Congratulations on the very strong results and guidance. Martin, if I could just ask a question, since Intel cut the CapEx again on the last call and kind of made the comments about slowing down Moore's Law, slowing down some technology transitions which a lot of people think TSMC is kind of suggesting they will do as well, obviously that's not affecting you in the short term given the terrific results and guidance, but what do you think the long-term impact is this on your business of that?","Martin Anstice","I think when we look at the totality of our industry and while it is true we have a consolidated industry and that means looking at 5 to 10 companies, everybody does have a slightly different story, and as an equipment company, our profile of business with any one customer is slightly different than others, and as many people have written, in fact the negative commentary from Intel from a cadence perspective obviously doesn't impact us as much as it does possibly for others. But we look kind of holistically here at the full spectrum of technology inflections and still feel very positive around medium-term and long-term business opportunities, and logic is in the mix and traditional shrink is in the mix, but there are many other market inflection opportunities for the Company and that's kind of what we're investing for and that's what we're trying to describe in terms of outperformance opportunity for the Company. So it takes all customers, all segments, all inflections and it's a lot of opportunity from my perspective to be innovative and creative, solving and contributing to the success of our customers long-term.","James Covello","That's very helpful, thank you. And if I could just ask for a follow-up, similar kind of situation to last quarter where the market was very concerned about what your results and guidance would look like on the heels of an Intel cut and maybe some more cautious commentary from TSM and just like last quarter you guys delivered a terrific quarter and gave guidance well above the street, do you think this is just a function of that much less exposure to those customers or do you think there's some dynamic here of you gaining share even if some of the customers that might be slowing down a little bit such that your commentary is much more constructive and your numbers are much better than your peers even in the context of those customers slowing down?","Martin Anstice","I mean let's not be confused, the outperformance commentary of the Company is not a commentary of being weak in places, so they are cutting investment. It is a fundamental commentary on deposition and etch and to some extent clean intensive technology inflections, which is creating a rather unique opportunity for our Company in our industry to grow and outperform, and the commentary that we've articulated today is a little stronger than we did a couple of weeks ago relative to revenues because as I hope all noticed, we said, we're now expecting revenues in the second half slightly stronger than the first half as opposed to kind of roughly balanced, and if we execute to that plan, we will be delivering our third straight year of 20% revenue growth in the Company, which is a tremendous commentary on fundamental growth opportunities that we think have traction for several years yet.","James Covello","Terrific. Thanks a lot for the color and congratulations again.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America.","Krish Sankar","I have two of them. First one, Martin, even though if December shipments are going to be down, it looks like your year-over-year shipments are still very impressive comparing where the WFE is going to be, so based on that my question is that if the growth, can you parse it out between how much of your growth is coming from SAM expansion and how much is it market share, is it 50-50, two third-one third, and then I have a follow-up?","Martin Anstice","1 don't know that I can answer that specifically for the year, Krish, but we have kind of characterized from the beginning of this inflection story roughly a two third-one third profile in favor of SAM expansion. So the market share story is indeed a meaningful component but it is the smaller of the two. And as a side note, we did recently increase our expectations to share growth in etch from the original 3% to 5% target to the 4% to 8% level.","Krish Sankar","Got it, got it. And then as a follow up, if I look at your September guidance and try to analyze it, you're kind of at the run rate that you gave in your target model on revenue side at a $36 billion WFE run rate, which obviously is not the case in September but it looks like you guys are running pretty well ahead of target, thanks to your model, the question here is that is most on the earnings power going forward going to be driven by the top line or are there any specific levers to pull on the OpEx side or customer mix that's going to drive the incremental EPS upside?","Doug Bettinger","Krish, a lot of it is going to come from revenue growth. Having said that though, we're not going to grow spending as quickly as we believe revenue growth will grow which is how you get from kind of where we are today at call it 22%, up to the 24% or so over the next several years. So there's leverage in the model, little bit in gross margin probably and in the spending line.","Martin Anstice","And just to supplement, we talked a lot about the focus on long-term growth, today's inflections, tomorrow's inflections, and the team has done a really nice job getting the proportion of operating expenses that's focused on R&D above the 60% level, and we've kind of repeated that again this quarter. And again to supplement Doug's point, the guidance today kind of really answers your question because today's guidance September over June is a 13% expansion of EPS on an 8% expansion of revenue's midpoint. So we're really focused on leverage and profitable growth not just market share and revenue growth. So we know the game.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, we've been doing it for three years running now.","Krish Sankar","Got it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.","Patrick Ho","Congrats on a really nice quarter and fiscal year. Martin, you talked about some of the spending trends that you saw in the first half of the year where DRAM was highly biased, you're seeing the emergence of 3D NAND spending as we head into the second half of the year. Are there any other segments that you're seeing the second half of the year that are picking up that's helping you deliver some of the outlooks both for September as well as the December quarter?","Martin Anstice","I think we have a pretty good presence through each of the inflections in the segment as you know and with the recent disclosure, despite comments on this call, the recent disclosure in press release about our progress with the North America logic company, we feel pretty good about participating broadly in the spending habits of our customers.","To your point, the view of the world today is not so very different in many respects to the view we had at the beginning of the year. We expected DRAM to be first half biased and it still looks that way, and we expected NAND to be second half biased and it's kind of picked up, and we expected kind of foundry logic to be neutral to maybe slightly stronger in the first half as well.","So running this Company in this industry, all of that is relevant and certainly notable but we're much more invested in investing with a medium-term, kind of longer-term horizon for obvious reasons. $3 billion SAM expansion opportunity is very important for us to stay focused on executing.","Patrick Ho","Okay, great. And Doug, maybe a question for you, something you've talked about on the Analyst Days and over the last few calls of the services business, some of the revenue opportunities there, that's always a business where you could always have margin improvement. What are some of the actions you're taking there to I guess further streamline that opportunity to help drive better leverage to the bottom line?","Doug Bettinger","Patrick, what we're really trying to do more than anything is set that part of the business to grow faster than just the growth rate of the installed base. As you know, the profitability of this part of the business is pretty good. It requires some direct investment, not a lot. But really what we're doing is, innovating the business model, innovating in how we're delivering value to customers so that we can grow the top line and the bottom line falls through just as the top line grows.","Martin Anstice","To be very direct, Patrick, it's all about value you can provide to the customer. If you can't provide much value to the customer, then you're not going to make much money selling it. So it's all about finding ways to understand their challenges and issues and support them as well as we can and we've got a lot of people invested in that agenda.","Patrick Ho","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","We'll next go to Timothy Arcuri with leads Cowen and Company.","Timothy Arcuri","Couple of things. I guess, Doug, I'm just looking at gross margin and if I compare gross margin and I look at the guidance and I compare that to the end of calendar 2013, revenues are up about $500 million a quarter or roughly $2 billion annualized and model has definitely played out, there's no question about that, I guess the one thing would be that margins hadn't really gone up despite all that additional revenue, and I guess are there any things you can do from a high level to sort of address that? I know you've talked about doing some more one-off projects for some customers which seems to be [indiscernible] a lot more value to them, so I wonder if maybe there's some way something you can do to capture that value to cause margins to have some upside from here?","Doug Bettinger","Tim, when I look at operating margin at least, we've delivered nice upside. We've gone from high teens a year ago into low 20s, right, so even though gross margin is kind of been level a little bit. The reason gross margin to level is, as we've talked about in the past, we've got more new tools coming out in the last 12 months than we ever had in the history of the Company, and in the first couple of quarters that new equipment is shipping. You don't have your cost as low as it's going to get and as you mature those tools and get them released into the high-volume environment, costs come down and margin gets better. That's really what is going on the gross margin line.","Martin Anstice","And this is maybe an important point relative to the philosophy of the Company, our most important vision objective is to focus on customer trust, which means in all respects, and we have to be cognizant of the distribution profit to the supply chain, we have to target a profitability level that we think is going to support the sustainable growth ambition of the Company, and so the model that we've articulated historically has been a baseline and I think although we didn't report a gross margin percentage in the long-term model the other day, Doug described the fact that more or less the headline for gross margins was the same today as it was a year or so ago.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot for that, Martin. And then I guess my second question is on shipments and you're not guiding December shipments, Martin, but it sounds like shipments are going to come down maybe 200 million to 300 million versus what they were in September, and I'm wondering given all the issues in China and you look at semis, many of the semis are guiding way below seasonal for Q3 and there's some obvious signs that foundry is going to get softer, so I'm just trying to assess how much in the foundry segment in particular, how much is risk-adjusted in that down 200 million to 300 million shipment number from September to December, is that primarily 3D NAND coming down or is there some risk adjustment also for the foundry segment too?","Martin Anstice","So you kind of gave me the answer in your question when you said you're probably not going to give guidance, and I'm definitely not, but to help you kind of triangulate, I mean some part of what will be our profile, and I have no idea if our profile is going to be the same or different than other equipment company, it's all a by-product of how you're participating and what your September is going to look like in terms of sequentials.","Some part of December message we communicated is a by-product of what I think will prove to be relative strength of our Company in the September quarter. I think some part of the commentary is simply a statement of this new variability challenge we described in our Analyst Meeting. In a consolidated semiconductor industry, just in context, the top five spenders are going to represent let's say 70% of wafer fabrication equipment: spending. If you're a $6 billion company, which is kind of what we're run rating to right now, that means in any one quarter the average spending from one of those top five customers is $0.25 billion.","So all it takes is an adjustment from one guy and you spring into the types of numbers that you talked about. Our focus is kind of obviously flexibility of business model to deal with that variability as well as we can but not to compromise the focus on long-term growth in the Company. So we've done our best to absorb the rumor and the substance of kind of industry tone in the last couple of weeks and obviously we spend a lot of time directly with customers trying to learn as much as we can and that's reflected in the guidance that we have given you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad","Congrats on another set of solid results here. Martin, I wanted to probe you on the fourth quarter expectations just a little bit. You kind of quantified the upside on the shipments, like the maximum ceiling for shipments in the fourth quarter. I was hoping you can provide some color on what level of downside could there be. And secondly, like you've built deferred revenues of about $200 million over last three quarters. How should we think about the revenues in the fourth quarter? Could we still get like flattish revenues from September to December?","Martin Anstice","I'm going to respectfully contain my comments on December quarter shipments which seem a long way away from our seat at this point in time to the answer I just gave to Tim's question, but certainly relative to revenues the message from the Company is very clear I hope. We expect slightly stronger revenues in the second half of this year than the first half of this year, and if we executed our plan, this will be our third consecutive year of 20% growth which I think is a remarkable commentary on the substance of the technology inflection growth opportunities we've described to you now.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you. And just a quick question related to your comment on NAND shipments, you mentioned the term 'NAND and other non-volatile memory' and considering that there was a new memory architecture that was announced yesterday, I just wanted to hear if you have started to see other orders or shipments in next-generation memory?","Doug Bettinger","It's Doug. We spend a lot of time working with customers on all of their next-generation technologies and aspirations. I'm not going to answer a question about any specific customer except to say we're very well integrated with everybody in the industry.","Operator","We'll next go to Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Weston Twigg","First just I know it's really early but wondering if you could just give us a little bit of your view on which segments might be up or down in your opinion in 2016 foundry, NAND, logic, DRAM, up or down, some early color?","Martin Anstice","West Twigg, you are very optimistic today with your question. So I'll do my best here and I think it's more qualitative than quantitative. As we said in the Analyst Event, we are still biased to an expansion of wafer fabrication equipment spending in calendar 2016 over 2015, and frankly a big part of that is influenced by the SAM expansion conversation that we have most knowledge of. So asking any equipment company to really applying with substance on WFE is a bit of a stretch because none of us sell product into every single segment of the industry, so we're always kind of imputing a WFE headline.","But I would say, the demand message holistically looks pretty descent I would expect and I see unit number next year that's probably a little higher than this year. I think that to the extent there are kind of inventory \u2013 I don't know if I would describe them as issues right now because I think it's pretty modest but there are certainly some evidence of minor industry corrections kind of playing out in the second half of the year. I think we go into next year with really good supply\/demand balance in all segments of the industry.","Next year is a very important year relative to transitioning from first phase investments and for some maybe second but primarily first phase investments in next-generation technology, and so the technology inflections of 3D NAND and FinFET transistor for example are really just beginning to get traction as device relevant. So I look at the demand statement and I feel reasonably good about all of it.","And then obviously I think there's maybe four fabs coming online in the first half of next year, three of them I think are foundry logic and one is memory. So it's very clear that the customer is committed to the medium and long-term inflections and they are very disciplined around their execution. So even in a world like DRAM for example where perhaps as a by-product of ASPs in the last three months, there's some level of anxiety, it's a superefficient conversion and it is a conversion that has business subsets, it's a better performing DRAM at lower cost.","And so at the end of the day it's all about the customer's ability to pay for that and if they can afford to do the upgrade then I think you see it executed. So I don't know if I would call out any one segment right now, I feel like there's legs in all three of them as we describe them, and we will see how the next kind of six months plays out before we get quantitative.","Weston Twigg","That was a very good answer, very helpful especially for what's a difficult question. So as a follow-up, can you help me understand the nature of the big increase in the future Japanese revenue, was that more CMOS image sensor or was that perhaps some memory shipment?","Martin Anstice","It was perhaps a little bit of both of those things, West.","Weston Twigg","Perfect. Thanks again.","Operator","We'll next go to C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse","I guess first question, I was hoping to get I guess discuss your thoughts on 10-nanometer ramp on the foundry logic side and how you would compare and contrast it to what you saw to 20 nanometer, 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer, both in terms of timing and magnitude of equipment, first the pilot and then high-volume?","Martin Anstice","I think in terms of timing, I'd refer you back to the slide that I presented in the Analyst Meeting, kind of not so much more to add there but the substance of 10 nanometer we think emerges next year and continues through 2017 with 7 nanometer investments playing out in the 2018 timeframe. So there's more details in the Analyst slide deck for you to take a look at.","In terms of how we would expect the 10 nanometer investment to compare and contrast, I don't know that anybody can really answer that question today and I'm repetitively exposed to a broad diverse set of opinions. My personal opinion is that 16 nanometer and 14 nanometer is obviously important nodes as first FinFET but I have the impression that the fabless community have expectations of performance and cost benefits in relative terms with 10 nanometer that will be greater than they realized in the 20 nanometer and 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer space, and when I read what I read from the foundries, that seems to be consistent with what they are describing as a business objective as well.","So, I would expect 10-nanometer to be a very robust technology node for the industry. In our models, as a point of reference we try to assess risk in our long-term models or opportunity in our long-term models. I think by the time we get to calendar 2018 in the logic and foundry combined, we've assumed about 150,000 wafer starts of 10-nanometer capacity.","C.J. Muse","By calendar start 2018?","Martin Anstice","That's it. By the time we get to the end of 2018, and I should have said foundry only, sorry, foundry only about 150,000 wafer starts by the end of 2018, that's our assumption in our [indiscernible].","C.J. Muse","Great. And I guess my follow up for Doug, two parts here, one, can you share what ending backlog was, and then two, for OpEx trajectory and the discrete items here in the September quarter, should we be getting back to low, mid-350s in December?","Doug Bettinger","C.J., I'm not going to give you bookings. I did that a quarter or so ago just kind of as a one-off thing.","C.J. Muse","No, but you do report ending backlog. I'm curious if you can share that.","Doug Bettinger","We don't report that.","Martin Anstice","You're going to see that in the 10-K.","Doug Bettinger","We report it one time a year and it's \u2013 I actually haven't even looked at it, C.J.","C.J. Muse","Okay.","Doug Bettinger","So then your second question on spending, it will come down, probably a little bit above the quarter that we just announced but pretty close I think.","Martin Anstice","Just to put the backlog statement in context, the reason Doug said what he said is the same reason that about seven or eight years ago Lam Research guys were not reporting bookings anymore. It gives a very misleading commentary on the ebbs and flows of the industry. And so when you take that input and then you take the very short-term nature and the cycle time compression that exist in the industry, the backlog for any of our companies today is much less a commentary on the future of the industry than ever before. So that's why it is only an annual disclosure that shows up in the 10-K filing.","Doug Bettinger","And it's not that meaningful for kind of upcoming shipments.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan.","Harlan Sur","Congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. On the roughly flattish shipment outlook for September, you pointed out strong 3D NAND. Can you guys just give us the rough sense directionally for your DRAM, foundry and logic shipments in September?","Martin Anstice","I'll give you a little color. It's going to be strong 3D NAND. DRAM is probably down a little bit. Everything else I think is pretty steady, plus or minus.","Harlan Sur","Okay, great, thanks for that. And I'm not complaining about the gross margin performance here but given your commentary around sort of record loadings in your manufacturing facilities back at SEMICON a couple of weeks ago, I'm also kind of somewhat surprised that the team is not driving some gross margin benefits from better overhead absorptions on higher revenues in the September quarter. Is it mix related as you mentioned or are there some other cost related issues that are masking the potential absorption benefits?","Martin Anstice","As you might expect, we're driving this conversation really hard but as you might also expect our customers drive the very same coefficient really hard relative to us contributing to their long-term success. So frankly speaking, the gross margin conversation does not exist in isolation, at least as we run our Company. We are very focused on trying to get the balance right, we feel like we've got a tremendous growth opportunity that can be executed in the context of the models that we presented, and for us to execute that and have sustainability it means we have to respond and respect to the long-term interest of our customers and other companies may choose different strategies and they may have different growth and profitable growth profiles as a result of that, ours I hope is very clear.","Operator","And we'll next go to Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit Shah","Martin, you mentioned 20% growth in the last couple of years as well as this year. When you think about sustainable growth, is 20% sort of the number that you have in your head looking forward?","Martin Anstice","That's a good try, Romit. I would say our objective is to grow faster than the industry. We have an outperformance objective. We've talked about trying to grow twice as fast as the industry and we've been able to demonstrate an ability to do that. I think that's the more definitive objective for the Company, and if WFE kind of goes up and it coincides with 20%, that's great.","Doug Bettinger","We should grow faster than the market and the industry, Romit, is the important point.","Romit Shah","Understood. Thanks. And then the other point you guys have mentioned at least as far as 2016 goes is, one reason why you're optimistic on DRAM is that 20-nanometer conversion is still low as a percent of the installed base. Do you have an updated number for what you think that is or what it might be towards the end of the year?","Martin Anstice","More or less the same number today, Romit, as before. Our expectation is, by the end of this year we've done about a third of the conversion to 20-nanometer done. So if the industry continues at the pace of calendar 2015 from a conversion point of view, it's another 18 months to two years before you're done and that's without one X and one Y and maybe even one Z in the roadmap of our customers.","So as I said in the Analyst Meeting, we've got kind of two to three nodes after the 20-nanometer technology node in the roadmaps of customers as we understand them today. So I think there's decent sustainability here. At the end of the day, as has been demonstrated many times in this industry, it's all about ability to pay and if the ASP environment puts too much pressure on profitability then obviously it's tough for folks to spend money on converting even if there's business substance to that investment.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Edwin Mok with Needham and Company.","Edwin Mok","Congrats on a great quarter. So first question on the etch market share number, I understand obviously you guys gave that target on the Analyst Event, but just kind of think about how you can achieve those numbers, how much of that is already designed that you believe you have already won in existing 3D NAND or FinFET or kind of newer inflection [indiscernible] opportunity versus has any of that or what portion of that is relying on customer corroborating to let's say thicker 3D NAND there like 72 layer 3D NAND or [indiscernible] 10-nanometer process and you won that business, is that what [indiscernible]?","Martin Anstice","I mean in the timeframe of right now, the selection decisions that are being made by the industry in logic, for example 10 nanometer selection decisions, now there are some a little bit left of that and then maybe even some a little bit right of that from a kind of early-stage selection perspective, but it would be irresponsible for me to say it's all in the bank because in this industry we should constantly have respect for the competency and capability of our competition, everybody that survived this long is good, and we should recognize that we have to work hard every single day to continue to realize the opportunity that we've described.","But I do feel like if we continue to execute in this Company and meet the commitments that we've made to customers, then in large parts the inflection story absolutely is as much in our control if not more in our control than anybody else. So 'in the bank' too strong a word but I think we've got good track records, we've employed the right strategy and you've heard me talk a lot in this call about supporting beliefs of customers, I think the instinct and the philosophy that we employ in the business on a day to day basis makes this story sustainable.","Edwin Mok","Okay, great, that's fair. And then, Doug, can I ask you about capital structure, any thoughts, I know you guys did the buyback and you guys put up dividend and raised dividend recently but any thoughts about putting more leverage on the balance sheet or maybe putting more, adding more debt on the balance sheet and can you remind us how much of your cash is onshore versus offshore?","Doug Bettinger","I mean right now I'm pretty comfortable with the balance sheet as it's at. We just a quarter ago raised $1 billion in debt. I feel very good about the cash we have in terms of funding what we need. So I don't see doing anything in the near term beyond what's there because we've got what we need. In terms of onshore\/offshore cash, a little less than half of the cash today on the balance sheet is onshore and obviously a little more than half is offshore.","Edwin Mok","Okay, great. That's all I have, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria","I will just combine both of my questions in one. Martin, just a question on the memory, DRAM versus NAND, industry trend and specific to your Company, you talked about logic and foundry being down slightly, of course memory is up. Can you talk a little bit about relative growth in DRAM and NAND for industry specific and also for your shipments because if I look at your shipment last year, your DRAM shipment were probably 40%, 50% more than NAND, and this year I get to almost even NAND and DRAM, so NAND has to be a huge growth, so if you can describe that a little bit qualitatively that will be helpful?","Martin Anstice","I mean from an industry perspective, the wafer fabrication equipment spending kind of the 2014 compared to 2015 under the assumptions we described in this meeting, DRAM and NAND both increased year-over-year and the increase is slightly greater I would say in DRAM than NAND Flash actually. I'm sorry, I said that back to front. So for the Company, we obviously have communicated to you a really important message in terms of a sound expansion for 3D NAND and that means in relative terms the story for the Company is going to be positive around the 3D NAND transition which is heavily deposition and to some extent also etch intensive.","So you got to see a stronger story for the Company in NAND because of that, but our outlook is both segments spent more money this year than last year and we see obviously a very meaningful inflection expansion for NAND next year and we believe consistent with the answer to last question that there's sustainability to the DRAM investment as well.","Operator","It does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. So at this time we will go ahead \u2013 we do have one more question.","Martin Anstice","We'll take one more, operator.","Operator","We'll take that question from Jagadish Iyer with [Bridgestone Technology] [ph].","Jagadish Iyer","Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Just one quick question, Martin. One of your competitors have highlighted that next year potentially there could be a slight slowdown in DRAM spending and one of your customers has also indicated that the bit growth for next year for DRAM could be lower. In such a scenario, how should we be thinking about the patterning opportunity for you for next year vis-a-vis this year?","Martin Anstice","I mean it's appropriate that you should make a connection between the multi-patterning growth opportunities for the Company in DRAM because multi-patterning shows up in DRAM as well as logic. I think the relationship in our assumptions next year is probably two-thirds logic one-third DRAM in terms of multi-patterning SAM. So there's definitely a consequence. If there was a scenario where DRAM spending did not play out, there is some level of consequence into the multi-patterning opportunity but the majority in the two-thirds I think if my memory serves me correct is logic based anyway.","Jagadish Iyer","That's helpful. Thanks so much.","Audrey Charles","Thank you, operator. That's all we have time for today. Thank you for your participation and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's call."],"13464":["Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) Q2 2014 Earnings Call January 29, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Shanye Hudson - Director of Investor Relations","Martin B.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Shanye Hudson, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you, Katia. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our outlook on the business environment and review our financial results for the December 2013 quarter and our outlook for the March 2014 quarter.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Martin.","Martin B. Anstice","Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start by sharing the highlights of 2013 company performance and then discuss our outlook for 2014, which provides our perspective on Lam's opportunities and areas of focus over the next 12 months. Doug will then follow with our financial results and guidance commentary before turning the call to Q&A.","2013 was an extraordinary year for Lam Research that establishes a platform for our future and unifies more than 6,500 global employees around the achievements of an exciting vision. We achieved nearly $4 billion of revenues and delivered in excess of our targeted gross margins for the 2013, 2014 timeframe of approximately 45%, representing an increase of 170 basis points year-over-year. We grew operating profit dollars twice as fast as revenues, illustrating our ongoing focus on strong operational execution and profitable growth. We delivered on time our committed synergy targets, with $100 million in annualized cost savings and approximately $130 million in revenues, both achieved with strong collaboration and ownership across the company.","Accelerated by our reenergized commitment to installed base performance, we closed the largest service contract in the company's history, tailored to support a broad range of customer-specific needs. And we defended our positions or gained market share in all of our business units through a period of evermore challenging customer requirements and competitive intensity. Combined, our performance in 2013 enabled us to outpace industry growth by a healthy margin, with system shipments up about 10% year-over-year for Lam and Novellus combined, compared with wafer fabrication equipment spending up around 3% to approximately $29 billion.","This 2013 performance demonstrates solid execution against our near term financial models, at a pace that we consider slightly ahead of schedule. As we move into 2014, we're continuing to aggressively pursue opportunities to drive further efficiencies in support of our growth objectives. We continue to position next-generation products targeting increased competitive differentiation and lower cost, both critical for the achievements of next level profit performance defined by our 2015, 2016 financial model.","We kicked off a multi-year plan to consolidate our real estate footprints, which we expect will drive incremental operating improvements. These plans also serve to increase the efficiency of our R&D activities and further promote collaboration across the organization, a key differentiator leveraging our culture and core value of customer, company and the individual.","We also established comprehensive 3-year plans across our integrated manufacturing and supply chain, which are based on an in-depth assessment of performance over the past 18 months. Our plans are built on our sustained commitments to pilot line and high-volume manufacturing strategic locations and strategic partnerships, outsourcing and localization. We target cost, quality and service benefits through these plans, which serve to increase our focus and strengthen competitive differentiation going forward.","In summary, through performance that meets or exceeds commitments made and the establishment of plans for execution for our future vision, 2013 was an extraordinary year and one which we hope serves to continue to compel our full stakeholder community, our shareholders, our customers, our suppliers and last, but not the least, our employees to invest in Lam for the long-term.","With our guidance and commentary today, we believe that we are off to a great start this year, and look forward to discussing more with you in the months ahead.","Our growth outlook for 2014 is enabled by our customer transition to next-generation logic and memory devices that make the much-anticipated inflections tangible and expanding opportunities for the company as customer adoption broadens through 2015.","We continue to forecast 2014 WFE spending of $32 billion, plus or minus $2 billion, with an incrementally broader participation of customers assumed relative to 2013. More than ever, the landscape of this year's investment pattern is influenced by the timing of inflection-specific activities. Although overall, we expect a reasonably balanced year, first half compared to second half, we do see variability quarter-to-quarter, resulting from the influence of a consolidated customer base and remaining uncertainty around the ultimate scope and timing of spending at the 4 inflections: FinFET, 3D NAND, patterning and packaging.","In the foundry segments, we saw the pace of 20-nanometer investments accelerate at the end of 2013, signaling a robust commitment in the demand for devices using 20-nanometer technology. As of today, spending is more heavily concentrated between a couple of customers, with capacity additions and conversion activities plans, primarily for the first half of this year.","In the recent period, the foundry space has arguably grown more competitive, with new entrants challenging the delineation of traditional pure-play foundries and logic manufacturers. For foundries, the race to develop FinFET devices has led to multiple pilot line projects starting in the first half of this year. We expect those investments to continue through the year with total capacity additions dependent on end-user demand and the pace at which production ramps yield. Taken together, our prior forecast for foundry spending between $13 billion and $14 billion, still seems reasonable for 2014.","Similarly, we maintained our forecast for microprocessor and other logic spending of around $6 billion or relatively flat with 2013 levels. Continuing the 2013 theme embedded in our forecast is the expectation that significant leading-edge logic production capacity can be satisfied through equipment reuse and capacity conversions.","Looking at the memory markets, we continue to see stable pricing conditions and tight supply entering 2014, with customers who continue to exhibit due rigor in evaluating their capital spending decisions. DRAM manufacturers are accelerating transitions to the mid-2x technology nodes and their broader participation of customers are entering 20-nanometer pilot production. We forecast this supply growth in the low 30% range, led by mobile device demand, and this is accomplished largely through equipment upgrade, albeit, with capital intensity higher than prior generations.","In the NAND segments, remaining planar capacity additions seem clear and the initial 3D NAND production ramp is progressing largely in accordance with our expectations. Over time, as the 3D devices move to structures with more layers, our customers appear to anticipate cost and performance benefits that support a broad industry conversion, which underpins their plans this year. We currently project between 80,000 and 100,000 wafer starts of 3D NAND shipped capacity will be installed by the end of calendar 2014.","In addition, in recent weeks, 2014 planar NAND investment plans to transition the 16-nanometer devices have solidified for more than one customer. Overall, we still expect supply bit growth to be in the low 40% range.","On a combined basis, we forecast memory spending will increase by 10% to 20% year-over-year, with wafer fab spends between $12 billion and $13 billion, representing an increasing proportion of WFE year-over-year at approximately 40% of the total.","Adding this all together, our outlook for 2014 wafer fabrication equipment spending, with a midpoint of $32 billion, would represent the fifth consecutive year with relatively healthy and disciplined equipment spending. It's always important to note that visibility beyond this quarter and especially into the second half is clearly more limited than the near term. Where we ultimately end up in our WFE range will largely depend on production readiness and market acceptance of the technology inflections just highlighted.","In this positive industry environment, which for Lam, is supplemented by inflection-led addressable market-size expansion and target market share growth, I'm very encouraged by our industry outperform opportunity.","With the transition to 3D NAND, we've gained strong production tool decisions, maintaining our lead in etch while driving significant gains in deposition. Our pipeline of new products were key to our success, including our next-generation dielectric etch module, our new highly productive dielectric deposition platform and our differentiated tungsten CVD system. We are well-positioned with each of the 3D NAND pilot lines, we believe, and are focused on achieving, at a minimum, the same degree of success as production tool decisions are finalized. We believe that we have additional opportunities to gain applications through the transition to second and third-generation 3D NAND devices, where the increased number of alternating films also proliferates the complexity of the etch and deposition processes. We're actively engaged with the customers to address those challenges.","In the area of multi-patterning, our conductor etch business is benefiting from the increased number of multi-packing steps required with the transition to smaller device geometries. Although device dependent, we see emerging evidence of slightly more than our early estimates of 8 to 10 new multi-packing steps in a 20-nanometer logic device for foundries, compared to a 28-nanometer baseline and the 12 to 13 steps for 16- to 40-nanometer devices.","In DRAM, the number of multi-patterning steps more than doubles with the transition to 20-nanometer going from 3 or 4 in a mid-2x device to between 8 and 10 at 20-nanometer, with the same evidence of upsize on number of passes. You should expect more specificity from Lam on this in the coming quarters.","This transition also presents growth opportunities for our deposition business. Many of the spacer-based, multi-patterning deposition steps can be done with batch variances [ph] today. However, customers are evaluating or starting to transition these steps to single wafer atomic layer deposition, or ALD tools, as the film conformality and uniformity requirements increased. We're engaged with multiple memory manufacturers with their offside ALD tool and, based on the feedback received so far, believe with continued hard work we are well-positioned for production tool decisions expected this year.","In logic, we often talk about the transition to FinFET structures and the complexity around the transistor. However, the complexity in the back-end is growing at a rapidly accelerating pace also. As transistor densities in these devices increase, the wiring schemes required to connect these transistors become more and more complicated. Starting around the 32-nanometer node, customers introduced a metal hard mask x scheme for a couple of wiring layers. The number of layers has grown with each successive node and Lam stands to benefit as the clear market leader for this application.","To maintain device reliability and performance, customers began adopting film treatments and other processes that play into a few of Lam's strengths. Our solar, ultraviolet thermal processing tool is the market leader used to improve the integrity of ultra low k films, predominately for leading edge logic devices. The number of layers required in UV cure of low k dielectric films is also increasing with each successive node; again, a positive opportunity for Lam. With thinner and more closely packed films, reliability of top lines is becoming more of a challenge. Lam has developed a unique film pretreatment module which enhances reliability and reduces resistance, a factor in device speed. Our solution was recently selected for next-generation logic devices and we expect to ship production tools through this year.","In single-wafer clean, we will have shipped our third next-generation spin clean system as planned in the next couple of weeks. These tools are being installed at leading memory and logic device manufacturers and are being evaluated for a broad range of applications, including front-end-of-line. It's still early, but the initial progress and process data we have received is in line with expectations and the intensity of managing yields to a higher definition access for our customers, clearly very relevant for evaluating that opportunity. We would expect to have broader reliability and process data towards the middle of the June quarter to begin making assessments on how the tools are performing relative to our customers' requirements and our competition in the second half. As we embark on 2014 and beyond, we believe the opportunities available to Lam Research are significant. We're focused on exploiting those opportunities to their fullest by continuing to strengthen our competitiveness. We're increasing the magnitude of new product releases and customer engagements, particularly in the areas of dielectric etch, atomic layer of deposition and single-wafer clean.","We're starting to execute newly developed operational plans to drive efficiencies across many aspects of the business, targeted at achieving our 2015, '16 performance ambition. We're reducing our emphasis -- sorry, we're reinforcing our emphasis on customer trust, broader collaboration and strategic relevance to our customer in light of semi equipment consolidation trends.","Today, we are very focused on achieving our long-term growth objectives, competing as one integrated company. We have tremendous strength in the capability and commitments of the whole Lam Research team and I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every employee for their contributions last year, and wish them success in pursuit of our 2014 vision, a year where, at the $32 billion WFE level, we anticipate increasing our operating income over 2013 at twice the rates of our revenue growth; further, growing cash from operations year-over-year at twice the rates of operating income.","With that, I will turn the call over to Doug to discuss December quarter financial results in more detail and provide our guidance for the March 2014 quarter.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Okay. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We finished calendar year 2013 on what I believe is a very strong note. Shipments for the December quarter reached an all time high. We achieved record revenues for a third consecutive quarter. We grew operating profit more than 2x as fast as revenue, and we delivered earnings per share above our expectations.","This financial performance comes partly as a result of us delivering on the promise of bringing Lam and Novellus together.","Let me now provide a little more detail of our December quarter. Shipments increased by 15% sequentially to $1,139,000,000 which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Consistent with our expectations, we saw strong growth in memory shipments, as well as a sustained level of foundry spending. The combined memory segment represented 64% of total system shipments and this was up from 48% in September.","NAND system shipments contributed 36% versus 28% in the prior quarter, and includes shipments to the first 3D NAND production facility. We saw a sizable increase in DRAM shipments, which represented 28% of system shipments, which was up from 19% in the September quarter.","Foundry shipments were 28% of total system shipments, and this was down from 36% last quarter. On an absolute dollar basis however, foundry shipment system -- or foundry system shipments were relatively flat, supported by ongoing investments for the 20-nanometer node. The remaining 8% was made up of logic and other shipments. Revenue for the December quarter was $1,116,000,000. This also was slightly above the midpoint of our guided range and was 10% higher than in the September quarter. December gross margin percentage came in pretty much as we expected at 48.5%, which was stronger than our 2013, '14 financial models. This was an 80 basis point increase from the September quarter.","We benefited from a favorable product mix during the quarter. And as I've shared with you before, our gross margin performance is impacted by many factors, including product mix, customer mix and overall business volumes. Increasingly, as we're running at close to full utilization, the impact of volume is less important than the product and customer mix changes. Nonetheless, we will see quarterly fluctuations in our gross margin performance depending on all of those variables.","For the calendar year, our gross margin performance of approximately 45% was fairly consistent with our financial model, and we continue to point to our financial model as the best proxy for our financial performance, including the timing and WFE reference points. Operating expenses for the December quarter increased to $302 million, consistent with our expectations.","On a percentage basis, our December quarter expenses were 27% of revenue, and this compares with 29% in the previous quarter. R&D as a percentage of total operating expenses was 58%. We continue to invest in next-generation products and technologies to strengthen our competitive position for the long-term success of the company.","Operating income increased by 27% to $209 million in the December quarter and this compares with $165 million in the September quarter. Our resulting operating margin was 18.7%, pretty much as we expected, and I think shows the operating leverage in our financial model.","Other income and expense came in with a positive impact of several million dollars relative to our original expectations. This was primarily due to a strong stock market in the quarter and its resulting impact on our deferred compensation investment portfolio. Our tax rate for the December quarter was approximately 9.3%, which was consistent with our planning assumptions. And I continue to expect the tax rate in the low to mid-teens will carry through the remainder of the 2014 fiscal year.","Based on the share count of approximately 172 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter totaled $1.10. This result was better than forecast coming into the quarter. And I should point out the share count includes the dilutive impact from our 2041 convertible note of approximately 6.6 million shares, and that was based on an average quarterly share price of $52.52. And I'll just remind you that we include a schedule on our IR website that shows the impact of this note to help you in your planning.","During the December quarter, we spent $40 million on the repurchase of approximately 760,000 shares of common stock with an average price of $52.20. At this point, we have completed more than half of our current $250 million authorization. This level of buyback will help us accomplish our objective of managing the dilution from our employee equity plans. I'd also just point out, we're well on track to complete this authorization in calendar 2014.","Let me now take you through the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with gross cash and short-term investments, including our restricted cash of $2.7 billion and this compares with $2.6 billion in the September quarter. Our cash balances remain roughly 25% onshore and 75% offshore. We had deferred revenue of $405 million, which does not include the $54 million in shipments to Japanese customers, which will convert the revenue in future quarters.","DSO for December was 74 days and this compares to 64 days in the September quarter. And as I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we expected shipments to be back-end loaded in the December quarter. Due to the timing of customer projects, this profile was somewhat more pronounced than we originally anticipated.","Inventory turns came in at 3.8, and that's flat with the prior quarter. Cash from operations was $129 million or 12% of revenue. This was up from $52 million in the September quarter. Our operational cash generation was impacted by growth in accounts receivable. Over half of our quarterly shipments occurred in the month of December itself. This translated into less of our receivable balance being due before the end of the quarter.","When business volumes are ramping as we are today, it's typical to see growth in working capital, and we did see that. Our current quarter outlook for the March quarter reflects a much more linear shipment profile and I expect operational cash flow to more closely approximate operating income next quarter. And I thought I'd just mention, I expect 2014 will be a very strong year for Lam Research's cash generation.","Company noncash expenses include, among other items, $23 million for equity comp, $41 million for amortization and $33 million for depreciation. In the quarter, we incurred $38 million for capital expenditures and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,550 regular full-time employees.","Let me now turn to our guidance for the March 2014 quarter. This is our non-GAAP guidance, I should point out. We expect shipments of $1,250,000,000, plus or minus $30 million, reflecting continued strength in the memory segment and ongoing investments for 20-nanometer foundry capacity. We expect revenue of $1,215,000,000, plus or minus $30 million. We currently expect higher customer concentration in the March quarter, with nearly 80% of our system-related sales derived from our top 3 customers, versus approximately 60% in the December quarter. We expect gross margin of 45%, plus or minus 1 percentage point.","In the March quarter, we have a higher proportion of newly introduced etch and deposition products, which has a slightly negative impact on gross margin, while those products are in the early phase of their ramp. We forecast operating margins of 19.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $1.15, plus or minus $0.05, based on a share count of approximately 173 million shares.","Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Martin and I would now be pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great job on the quarterly execution. On the 3D NAND side, I think the team has mentioned previously, your views that it's predominantly one guy in the market this year. I know that at least 2 of your memory customers that have recently talked about some 3D NAND activity later this year or early next year. Just wondering if you're seeing this now in the product pipeline for the second half?","Martin B. Anstice","Thanks for your comment at the introduction there, Harlan. The answer to your question is yes, we are. I expect, still, one customer to be the dominant kind of emerging out of pilots to production. And to the extent that other customers are investing in 3D NAND, which we do expect, there are pilots-oriented investments. But it is more than a one-customer assumption set that's embedded in our $32 billion, correct.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then on your significant installed base, your services business, how do you expect the growth here relative to your overall businesses this year? Industry utilizations, I would think, are trending higher, and so what are -- and then on top of that, what are some of the specific initiatives both sort of top line and cost and expense front that the team is going to be focused on this year with respect to services?","Martin B. Anstice","I think on the utilization front, kind of, time will tell. I mean, instinctively, I agree with the hypothesis of your question but it's not as if, with some rare exceptions, utilization levels are -- they're kind of not -- are kind of low there. They're pretty active. I mean, certainly in the memory space, that's a true statement and I think the technology nodes, given the flexibility the foundry community have, utilization pretty high there as well. But indeed, to the extent utilization goes up, that's one source of growth. Another source of growth is the installed base of the company. So there's a natural expansion of the growth consistent with the output of the company. And you can see evidenced by our actual performance and forecast, we've got some nice momentum on outputs of systems into the installed base and that bodes well for sustainable growth this year into next year. And as we talked about in our Analyst Meeting and a little bit in the last 2 earnings calls, the installed base business of the company, the spares, the service, the upgrade, the training, the refurbishments, are tremendous opportunities to contribute value to the customer and that being a core strength of the history of both companies. But I would say it is fair to characterize that we're reenergized around that today. And in the context of responding to complex challenges from our customers, to not just deliver technology but to deliver cost. That's an opportunity for us to strengthen partnerships with our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things. Relative to WFE for 2014, we're sort of exiting December at this sort of $33 billion run rate as an industry. I'm not sure if you think that, that's the right number but that's what I calculate. So if the year is going to be sort of $32 billion, I think you're saying, and if the first half is going to be better, does that sort of imply that the year is going to be front-half loaded or you just don't have visibility into the back half? And if it's better, then the year would be higher than your $32 billion number.","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I think as I said in my prepared comments, we obviously have less visibility in the second half than first, but we do have some assumptions, which are based in that $32 billion. And I think reasonable balance between first half and second half is kind of an overall commentary I would offer for WFE in total. But I would say one segment that stands out in that kind of picture is DRAM, where I think there is a higher profile of first-half investment compared to the second. And I don't know if that's a 60-40 or a 55-45 or a 65-35, time will tell. But that is the segment which stands out, at least at this point, as being slightly more biased to the first half. Now, a lot of things could change in either direction and, clearly, to the extent that prevails, that's an opportunity for Lam to outperform, given kind of memory concentration in the first half compared to the second half as far as peer comparisons are concerned. Although as I said, I do expect outperformance in the calendar year period. So that's the best I can offer you at this point, Tim.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just as a second question, you had a pretty big quarter for NAND obviously, in December. Do you have a sense of what the shipment mix is going to look like in March? I would assume memory is going to be maybe down a smidge and foundries up, but can you give us a sense?","Martin B. Anstice","No, I think actually that we've got memory expansion in shipments December to March and foundry, fairly stable.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Yes, that's exactly what we're expecting.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And likewise, congratulations on a great 2013. Martin, first, in terms of kind of big picture looking out over the next couple of years in terms of your market opportunity, with the continued delays in EUV, have you made any revisions to your, I guess, target models in terms of both etch and deposition over the next few years, particularly as you look at 2015 and 2016, given the pushouts that have occurred?","Martin B. Anstice","That's a good question. Thank you for your comments at the beginning as well. We have not chosen to revise the models for '15 and '16 yet. I think, clearly, we would be looking for incremental opportunities to the baseline that we established if indeed the EUV picture, as recently characterized, plays out that way. And we've got a lot of time between now and then in terms of positioning for 7-nanometer logic, particularly into the extent there is any interception at 10. Frankly, 10-nanometer positions are still out there in many respects, as well. So we haven't changed the model per se, but I would expect us to be chasing a broader set of opportunities as a result of this.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And maybe as a follow-up question to some of your prepared remarks about the DRAM opportunity, particularly for double patterning at 20-nanometers, you talked about the different layer opportunities that increased. Can you maybe go a little more specific in terms of where you see the greatest opportunities within etch, kind of on a more granular detail, as well as the opportunities in deposition? Where specifically do you see the greatest incremental opportunities as you move to 20-nanometers from DRAM?","Martin B. Anstice","Wow, that's really specific. One of the things I don't want to do, frankly, is get a little bit ahead of ourselves on the number of extra passes, which is of the most tangible area of growth for us in the DRAM conversion and -- because I want to see more evidence that, actually, the emerging messages that I communicated to you today actually show up on a continuing basis. But we're really focused on high aspect ratio opportunities. We're really focused on -- in the x space, we're really focused on packaging and ALD with conformality and uniformity challenges being more significant in next-generations. That's the area for us. I mean, it's all about inflections and it's all about emerging technologies to support narrowing kind of requirements on process windows that are tough to deal with.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Martin, just a clarification first. You said memory up 10% to 20% this year, that was including both DRAM and NAND?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Any chance of giving us a breakdown in terms of how you think each of those markets grow this year?","Martin B. Anstice","Indeed, I could probably give you some reference on that. If you have a follow-up question, why don't you ask that first and I'll do a little bit of research while you're...","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. The follow-up would be understating your comment about 60% of the business coming from the top 3 in December and 80% from the top 3 in March. Within NAND, specifically, are the -- is the remainder of the 40% and 20%, respectively, are there other NAND players in there as well or is NAND very top-heavy loaded?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I mean, there are only kind of so many players, obviously, in the NAND space. And the mixture of spending has kind of 3 components to it. It has a 3D investment, which in '14 is different than '13 by virtue of more people engaged in a pilot line space. So that's one investment type. Another investment type is whatever additions are going to be made in the context of remaining planar investments. And then a significant investment in NAND flash comes from conversions. And that's obviously a play in a dominant conversation for the customers. So if I looked at additions, I would say the additions via 3D NAND, and if I look to upgrades, it's all about kind of planar investments. And I would not expect this year to be the year where, all in, 3D is the majority of NAND investments. So if I look at the sum of additions and upgrades and conversions, I would say calendar '14 is still likely to be -- it's getting closer, but it's still likely to be a planar majority year. So the answer to your first question is, obviously, the baseline for NANDs WFE in '13 is a little higher than DRAM. We assume about $6 billion for NAND last year and $5 billion or so for DRAM. I believe there's about $1 billion or so of growth in NAND year-over-year. And frankly, something similar to that level in DRAM as well. So reasonably equal growth increments, slightly different baseline.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess my first question, you talked about 2 dampening impacts to gross margin in the March quarter: new product ramps and customer concentration. I'm kind of curious if you could help me quantify what kind of hit those 2 dynamics are having in the March quarter and how we should think about those dynamics throughout the year as we think about gross margins?","Douglas R. Bettinger","I mean, I'm guiding you down -- John, this is Doug -- 80 basis points from what we just delivered. I'm not going to quantify the specific impact of each of those, but they both contribute, obviously offset a little bit by slightly higher volumes. But as I tried to indicate, the volume bit is getting to be less and less important because we're running the factories pretty full right now. So the upside from that is less today than it has been in the past.","Martin B. Anstice","And I would add, I think an important point relative to the interpretation of the financial models. So if you kind of go back to what we presented at SEMICON West last calendar year, you get a '13, '14 model and a '15, '16 model. And the fact that we had 2 models was intended to be important because it does take time as well as volume to execute cost reduction plans in terms of developing new products for lower cost profiles, et cetera, et cetera. And it does take time to execute and implement strategic plans to improve the performance of the company, however good we are in terms of competency and capability and execution. So the '13 and '14 model had a 45% placeholder and, within reason, that's a great place to be in terms of kind of modeling. And just occasionally, we're going to pop up above it as we did in December. And maybe just occasionally, we popped below it. It's much less about volume at this point. We need time to kind of get us through this period of the penetrations on the inflections. So we come out of the gates and you launch a new product, it's usually at its lowest profitability point in that first 6 months to 1-year time horizon. And the inflections are becoming a greater proportion of the output of the company. And '15 to '16 is a great placeholder for when the majority of that inflection and the majority of the new products associated with it, which should be firing on all cylinders from a cost point of view at that point, have their impact on the company. So I'd ask that you all think through not just the volume, but the timelines that were defined in the models that we communicated last year.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, Martin, as my follow-up -- I appreciate the detail, as always. As we think about EUV getting pushed out, I think one of the things we're seeing is the chip companies are getting more efficient on multi-patterning. The largest foundry guy was not expecting a density improvement at 16; now he's talking about it. The largest logic guy is talking about being able to stay on Moore's Law, even without EUV for a lot longer than we thought. And I guess my question to you is, I'm trying to understand if they learn to be more efficient with multi-patterning, does that actually take market opportunity away from you? Or are they becoming more efficient because of what you're providing?","Martin B. Anstice","I mean, I'm sure all of you have obviously asked that question. I mean, the perpetual challenge in this industry is bringing technology to the customer at lower cost, bringing capacity and outlook to the customer at a low cost. And so I am sure and hope, quite frankly, that we're enabling not just technology roadmaps to customers, but cost reduction roadmaps to customers because I think we all recognize the complexity of our customers' industry and our customers' customer industry for that matter. So we have to run Lam Research with a long-term perspective in mind. And so I always think it is very artificial to try and bias performance in the short-term by not delivering solutions to the customers that in the long term will allow them to be most successful. So I'm sure we're part of enabling and, indeed, the customer by virtue of consolidation and influence over the equipment industry, brings a pretty big back to the table as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just one follow-up question on WFE. If the industry spends more than your initial view of $32 billion, where do you think the upside would come from? Do you think it would be higher foundry or would it be on memory side?","Martin B. Anstice","I think it's kind of a couple of things. There's a demand story, so I don't think $32 billion is the most aggressive view of kind of GDP in consumer confidence. And if that kind of trended up, there's -- I think, there's a little bit of upside there. The other part of it, to your point, frankly, is emerging evidence of cost and performance benefits of inflection-led device transition. So if the industry sees cost and\/or performance benefits, I guess, the industry of our customers' customer sees the benefits, then there's likely to be an acceleration, if history is a relevant indicator of our future. What the probability of that is at this point? I have no idea, which is why I gave you $32 billion, plus or minus $2 billion.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Okay, and there wouldn't be any -- it wouldn't be like memory over foundry if there was some upside?","Martin B. Anstice","I think I wouldn't characterize, one way or the other at this point, which one I thought was more likely to happen. There are clearly independent variables on the supply side. They're very dependent on the demand side, so I don't know. It could go either way.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Martin, I had 2 questions. Number one, in terms of the 3D NAND on the etch side, is your market share similar or better or lower compared to planar NAND?","Martin B. Anstice","It's at least as good and I would expect in some of the selection spaces, slightly better.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And then one other question. In terms of your industry outlook, you said that you're seeing a lot of reuse of equipment on the logic side, which is kind of not a big surprise. The question I was trying to find out is are you seeing with capital, in terms of in the foundry, is still very high? Are you seeing more reused inventory from the foundry customers or do you think that's going to happen going forward?","Martin B. Anstice","I think it will be an emerging trend. I think it's a very hard thing to execute and, at some level, the need and the expectations for it are obviously embedded in the numbers we've given you on WFE. But I think the economic realities of scaling for the foundries make it much more important than ever. And the challenge obviously, is if they have sustaining commitments from their customers, so the legacy geometries how do they ever free up the capacity to make it kind of happen on scale. So I think it shows a -- more how big it ultimately is. I think time will tell.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","My question is for Doug. Do you have any plans to help increase the cash onshore as a means to increase shareholder return?","Douglas R. Bettinger","Mehdi, I kind of described our approach to cash is we've got a plan in place at least through 2014, which is the $250 million buyback authorization. Yes, we're always looking at opportunities and whether they're -- crude guidance I've provided is roughly 20% of the prospective cash we generate is onshore. We may be able to tick that up a little bit. In fact, I think we will. We're always looking at a couple of different things and we'll communicate with you kind of year-by-year or quarter-by-quarter as we work our way through this authorization, what the concrete plans of the company are as we go forward.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And my brief follow on is for Martin. Do you have any market intelligence, especially from downstream players to help us understand the application for 3D NAND use, especially with the 80,000 to 100,000 wafer per month capacity that you were referring to?","Martin B. Anstice","I think we do, but I'm going to reserve the right to keep that to our ourselves and respect the interest of our customer.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Can you talk around it or qualitatively talk about some of the general use of the 3D NAND?","Martin B. Anstice","I know you don't like me doing this, but I am going to resist it because I feel like we put a lot of information out and, just occasionally, I got to stay honest and protect some of what we spend lots of time building, which is relationships with customers and customers' customers, so that we have a good a sense of where the industry is headed.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And you're saying that this 80,000 to 100,000 would be installed by September so that it would -- the shipment would start by December? Is that right?","Martin B. Anstice","No, it's a statement of physical shipments to customers. So by the end of the calendar year, that is the number I gave you.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I show that because the Korean customers have both told us...","Shanye Hudson","Mehdi, we're going to move on here now. Could we get the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Martin, a question on the foundries, the linearity of 20-nanometer ramp up. You talked about the ramp base dependent on the availability of the technology. Where do you think the 20- and 14-, 16-nanometer are in terms of readiness? And from that, what can you tell us about the ramp profile of these technologies?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I think, kind of back to my earlier statements, the assumption that we're making today based on our conversations with customers and our own modeling is that foundry is a reasonably stable year. It's going to have, obviously, a majority forum 20-nanometer for first half and 14, 16 emerges in the second half as kind of pilot lines. So you're going to see a different node of spending in the calendar year. And if nothing changes in terms of commitments of the customers' customer to FinFET devices, then the rates by the foundry to kind of get whatever early share momentum is available tends to suggest a pretty kind of convicted spending to that plan. And I don't think this is the year where a 14 to 16 investment is particularly subject to risk on yield because it will be too early, it's not enough. I mean, it will be a much more relevant conversation in calendar '15. If 14, 16 yields aren't where the customers want it to be, then I'm sure that will be relevant to the pace of the add capacity, but I don't see that as being a particularly big factor in calendar '14.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then you made comments regarding space or double patterning driving ALD. My question is, is there a significant adoption of spacer-based double patterning in the DRAM and the logic devices? I know NAND is 100% space to double pattern, but are you seeing a lot of interest from DRAM, as well as logic devices?","Martin B. Anstice","DRAM, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Northland Capital Markets.","Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","In terms of the reuse, can you characterize the amount of reuse for your equipment, 28- to 20-nanometer and 20 to FinFET, and kind of split that between etch and CVD?","Martin B. Anstice","You need to ask that question again because you're breaking out. Sorry.","Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","If you look at the equipment reuse between 28-nanometer foundry logic and 20-nanometer, and then similarly 20 to 16 or 14 FinFETs, what's the difference in the amount of your equipment that can be reused? And is there a difference between etch and CVD?","Martin B. Anstice","Okay. The etch and CVD conversation's a little bit premature for me to have. And the first one -- the first piece, it's a little difficult, but the best I could give you probably is that I think in general, the equipment set for 20-nanometer generally is much more overlapping with a 14 and 16 equipment set than was true for 28 to 20. So I would say, intuitively, it would seem there are more opportunities for reuse 20 to 14 to 16 than existed 28 to 20. Now, that's a line availability statement as an -- or ease of transition. That doesn't take off the table, the challenge I described a little earlier, which is if you got demand from a customer and you have legacy demand for some years, how do you free enough capacity to go do it? But intuitively, I think that the reuse opportunity for the foundry is greater 20 to 14, 16, presuming you have 20 investments of a sufficient amount than was true at 28 to 20.","Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up is that you talked a little bit about the customer concentration. For 2014 calendar year, do you expect the same customer concentration as 2013?","Douglas R. Bettinger","No. Actually, I think it will be a little bit less. When we look at it, I mean, the March quarter is pretty concentrated. I think the whole year is actually going to be the same or maybe even a little bit less than '14 relative to '13.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","First question regarding the industry. Just on your foundry, WFE a little [ph] up 10% to 20%. I was wondering how much of that comes from kind of increased capital intensity in your foundry versus broadening of customer base? We heard from one of your peers talk about they saw some trailing etch to the order pushed out at the foundry side. I was wondering if that had an effect on how you think about the foundry position. [ph]","Martin B. Anstice","I don't think that dollars invested in '14 and '16 will be as high as 20% in the calendar year. That's the assumption that we have at this point and we have said -- and we're much more able to speak to this for deposition etch and cleans than we are wafer fab as a whole, but we've kind of sized the increment in SAM to the 5% to 10% level, I think, for the comparison of final generation planar, first generation FinFET for foundry. So that's kind of the best I can give you on capital intensity.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","All right. I see. Okay. That's fair. And then I think you mentioned about one of the largest service contract you signed on the quarter and try to focus on the service area. Any way you can kind of quantify how much of your business is service right now, how do you think that will transpire as we go, look beyond this year, let's say '15, '16? Do you expect a greater growth in that area? And any kind of metric you can add that does kind of measure that?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I think actually, we gave a pretty good shot at answering that question in the Analyst Meeting at SEMICON West last year, so I'd kind of refer you back to the July 9 presentation. There's kind of more substance there than we have time for today. But just so we're not confused, it's not just kind of a service play. It's an upgrade play. It's an installed base utilization play. It's a reliability play. It's training. It's everything that's available to us as an equipment company, supporting our customers' installed base improvement expectations. Service is one part of that, but it's not a growth plan limited to service.","Shanye Hudson","Operator, I think we have time for 2 more questions.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Actually, 2 quick ones. First, you gave the 80,000 to 100,000 3D NAND installed capacity by the end of '14. Can you just help us understand what that number was end of '13?","Martin B. Anstice","I think we had like 20,000 to 25,000 as the communication at the end of last year.","Douglas R. Bettinger","Yes, I think we said 20,000, Terence.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, terrific. The second question is on customer concentration. Starting at 80% in that first quarter, it implies a pretty sharp broadening in the second half of customer shipments. Can you just explain to me how you expect that to develop sequentially and, again, remind us what '13 was? And I ask that because with the context of understanding whether conviction in those shipments and the timing and assurance of those shipments is higher or lower than with the larger customers?","Douglas R. Bettinger","Terence, I think the most concentrated quarter is going to be the March quarter. I'm not going to get into the specifics of each quarter after that because things move around, but it will broaden out our view as we get through the remaining quarters.","Martin B. Anstice","I don't know, to the kind of soft part of your question, is it a higher risk or a lower risk to have more people participating? Who the hell knows. I tend to feel that the reasons for more people investing and there are more reasons around -- technology inflections inherently have more conviction than kind of genetic capacity additions, so I actually feel pretty good about that. And I also feel like the environment, the supply and demand balance and the fact that we come into the year pretty tight, the fact that pricing levels for memory, the fact that the profitability levels for semiconductor companies generally is -- maybe they would argue not as good as they'd like it to be, but it's far better than it has been. And so I tend to feel better about it. I do think that you should, we should continue to expect variability quarter-to-quarter. I mean, it is really hard to predict the output of these companies when 2 to 3 to 4 guys can represent everything about the performance of your company. One guy can move left or right and you've got a different picture. And we've kept our ranges pretty narrow on our guidance and we'll keep them that way as long as we feel like we can manage it. But I would say it's getting much more difficult to manage variability of kind of individual customer movements than ever before.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Chad Dillard on for the line of Vishal. From the industry's perspective, can you talk about how you see the amount of 20-nanometer being installed for 2014 from a wafer start perspective?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, given the concentration of a couple of customers, I'm going to kind of resist that level of specificity. It's, as I said, I do expect the -- maybe you got to triangulate a little here. We are forecasting in the range of $13 billion, $14 billion of WFE. I think kind of the public commentary and analyst commentary on 20-nanometer cost is approximately $1.25 billion, $1.3 billion per 10,000 wafer starts addition. And I kind of said I expect that the 20-nanometer addition is greater than the 14 and 16 addition. I think if you kind of work with those data points, you're going to find out a pretty reliable answer to your question.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And maybe you could just unpack the foundry shipment, the number in December. What was the mix of 20-nanometer versus the rest?","Martin B. Anstice","We don't -- that's disclosure above and beyond what we have customarily done, I'm sorry.","Operator","Thank you, and I would like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks. Please go ahead.","Shanye Hudson","Wonderful. We truly wish to thank you all for spending the last hour or so here with us today. As a reminder, a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. So on behalf of the entire management team here, we would like to -- we appreciate your interest in Lam Research.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today.

Please go ahead.","Satya Kumar","Thank you and good afternoon everyone, and welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, we will share our outlook on the business environment, review our financial results for the September 2016 quarter, our outlook for the December 2016 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results is distributed a little after 1 PM Pacific Time this afternoon. It can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.","Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosures of our SEC public filings.

A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 PM Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","And with that, let me hand the call over to Martin.","Martin Anstice","Good afternoon and thank you all for joining our regularly schedules earnings conference call. Anticipating our upcoming investor and analyst meeting plan for New York on November 18, I will keep my prepared comments shorter than usual. The focus today will include financial, operational and market highlights for the September quarter and calendar year 2016; an update on recent changes in the industry environments; and initial perspectives we have on calendar 2017. Doug will then provide details of our financials and summarize guidance for the December quarter before we open the call for questions. ","Demonstrating the constancy of our focus, quality of alignments in the company and commitments to invest in the future of the company for these last several years, Lam delivered another outstanding quarter reporting record shipments including a record high foundry shipments, record total company revenues and non-GAAP net income. As is always the case, how you do something is at least as important as what you do more so in the context of our multiyear growth and value aspirations. Accordingly, we have a permanent focus on customer oriented core values and culture, and an extraordinary commitment to operational execution and company scaling.","Our supply chain, our factories, our field service organizations once again delivered terrific performance. We achieved a new record for shipments in the quarter. We are on track to deliver our customers a combination of schedule flexibility and on-time performance for the year that is a significant enhancement of capabilities. And as shown by our guidance today, we are gearing up for an additional growth in December. Our differentiated product pipeline momentum continues apace most recently with metal ALD in 3D NAND and atomic level etch in dielectric foundry applications. In addition, our business teams are achieving more than 90% success in critical defenses and new market application penetrations combined which is extremely rewarding. This is an exciting time to be part of the semiconductor ecosystem, no doubt.","In the world of foundry logic, the demonstrated performance benefits of 10-nanometer technology and commitments of our customers and reportedly more than 20 of their customers to the near-term seven 7-nanometer are strong endorsements of the diversity of cloud mobility and high-performance computing enabled consumer and enterprise applications. What is clear in this segment also is the importance of 3-D architecture at both the chip and systems integration level. Innovation in our technology and product roadmap for the transistor, interconnect and also advanced packaging applications is a critical priority for systematically strengthening our strategic relevance. We believe Lam is one of very few companies gaining share through this round of foundry logic technology node transitions.","Our segment exposure continues to be more balanced and an objective in results we are particularly pleased with. Worthy of note in a world where we estimate foundry wafer fabrication equipment spending grows 25% year-over-year 2016 compared to 2015, we are communicating to you today with our presented results and December guidance a view that our foundry shipments for the year increase by approximately 40%. Illustratively, 48 layer 3D NAND is enabling the 256 gigabytes high density storage that is required to power high resolution image capture and dual cameras in smartphone devices. Similarly in the data center, 3D NAND-based SSDs allow for hundreds of terabytes of high-speed storage to be located within the server itself enabling cost-efficient scale from cloud-based services. Looking ahead, the roadmap is well-defined and looks very promising for 3D NAND.","At the recent Flash Memory Summit in Santa Clara, our customers highlighted the numerous design and integration options not previously available with Planar technologies such as scaling layer accounts and the ability to transition from three-level cells to quad little cells and leveraging pitch and density scaling to target different storage end markets. Lam was privileged to be the only major semiconductor equipment maker invited to present at the conference, independent recognition of our critical role in the 3D NAND deflection and the commentary both on the opportunity and responsibility for Lam that is shared with our customers.","Long-term WFE growth is only made possible with end market demand catalysts and process technology inflections. Combined with these two drivers, our roadmap and multiyear execution make possible the fifth consecutive year in 2016 where our SAM has outperformed WFE. Looking forward, we have targets and strategies that we will specifically discuss in November to enable and participate in these outperformance trends for many years to come. Our ability to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity is all about leadership execution and is measured ultimately by customer trust and competitive differentiation.","As illustrations, in conductor edge, our keel family with its hydra multizone temperature control technology provides the most technically advanced production proven etching performance critical for logic and DRAM multi-patterning in the industry. Lam has the broadest and strongest conductor edge position especially in 3D NANDs were [7:42] has now been qualified before production at all NAND customers for a majority of applications which we believe achieved position in more than two thirds of the available market.","In dielectric etch, we continue to make several technology and productivity enhancements to our Flex family including most recently the release of atomic level etch capability. Our ALE innovation features a proprietary advanced mixed mode pulsing capability, delivers a 2x improvement in selectivity versus conventional etching while providing atomic level control over variability critical to address issues like RC delay for advanced foundry and logic process nodes. The Flex series products are seeing substantial momentum in 3D NAND and are now qualified as production toll of record for critical high aspect ratio applications at all major customers.","In deposition, our ALTUS tungsten fill and VECTOR dielectric deposition systems are seeing very strong momentum that is set to continue into next year. 2017 will be the year of 64 layer 3D NAND and Lam\u2019s product innovations and application share momentum position us well to improve our market share as we head into next year.","Complementing our leading edge and critical applications strength, the performance of more than 40,000 Lam process modules installed provides a strong platform for overall business momentum and is a key focus of our customer support business group. This business is on track for another record year. More important than reported growth in any one year, however, is the increased confidence of sustaining long-term profitable growth trajectory of the company. In the last several years, we have fundamentally improved our capability to support our customers through local manufacturing and warehousing, innovative technology and productivity upgrade solutions, refurbished equipment sales and service, and product solutions to overall fab productivity improvements. These investments are paying dividends again more to follow at our investor event. ","Now let me provide a short overview of customer equipment spending trends for calendar 2016 and our preliminary expectations for 2017. Outlook for global economic growth in unit shipments for PCs and smartphones have remained stable since our last report. Increasingly, more important than unit demand for traditional consumer computing devices however is a significant growth in content for leading-edge memory and logic devices in smartphones and servers. This dynamic is being driven by the end market demand inflections I spoke of earlier and is powering our SAM growth outperformance opportunity.","WFE spending for 2016 is now tracking slightly above the high end of our previously communicated range driven by stronger foundry and 3D NAND CapEx investments. Sequentially for calendar 2016, NAND WFE is now on track to grow over 40%, foundry over 20%, and expectations for DRAM CapEx remain unchanged at down approximately 40% year-over-year.","Momentum and commitments continues to build for 3D NAND where we now expect total industry shipped capacity to reach approximately 425,000 wafer starts per month by the end of this calendar year. We are confident of sustainable positive long-term trends in this segment. At the same time, our strength in Foundry logic continues to build where we are realizing the benefits of multiyear efforts through customer spending associated with additional qualifications and PTR wins for 10 and 7 nanometer devices. Despite the challenges of DRAM and certain pockets of logic spending in 2016, despite also the memory versus logic segment headwinds for the company relative to our peers this year. We are on track to grow total company shipments meaningfully for the fifth straight calendar year at a CAGR of approximately 18% over that extended period.","As we look into 2017, we are encouraged by the strong momentum in 3D NAND. For numerous reasons, we are also more convinced and convicted in our belief that DRAM supply and demand conditions will continue to improve as we previously indicated. As a result, we have an upward bias to spending expectations for DRAM and NAND in 2017.","We expect flat to a modest pullback in logic foundry spending as customers digest the 10 nanometer investments made in 2016 and commence initial 7 nanometer roadmaps. Overall, we are modeling slightly higher total WFE spend in 2017 with memory versus logic segment tailwinds for the company once more. Again, our objective will be to outgrow WFE in 2017.","To summarize, fundamental to our strong performance has been our strategy to partner closely with our customers to help address their most tough and difficult challenges. Despite as we conveyed a couple of weeks ago, the disappointment at not being able to deliver to our customers the potential of unmatched capability and innovation from Lam and KLA-Tencor combined, we are very excited by the demonstrated multiyear strength and inflection-driven outperformance future opportunity for Lam Research.","With continued execution, a robust product pipeline, overall stronger install base and market share positions, and increased strategic relevance to our customers, we believe the innovation to support long-term value creation for all stakeholders is a valid ambition for Lam Research.","Before turning the call over for additional details on our financial performance and outlook, I would like to extend my genuine thanks to our customers and employees who together make the exciting story of Lam Research possible. Their support and encouragement inspires us each day to achieve our full potential. Doug?","Doug Bettinger","Okay, thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. The September quarter results reflect another quarter of solid execution and record results. In the quarter, shipments, revenue, net income and cash from operations were at the highest level we delivered in the history of Lam Research. We're obviously very pleased with what we achieved this quarter.","Shipments in the September quarter were $1.78 billion, up approximately 8% compared to the June quarter and at a record level for the company. The combined memory segment made up 56% of system shipments and that was down from 66% in the prior quarter. Non-volatile memory shipments contributed 43% of the system shipments and this was down from 51% in the June quarter.","3D NAND investments are continuing at a healthy level with customers committed to their plans for scaling the technology to reduce cost, enhance performance and increase output in response to strong customer demand. Our deposition net products are critical to enabling the scaling for customers. We are extremely well-positioned with the PQR decision made by our customers and what may be the largest multiyear growth opportunity in semiconductors.","Customer discipline remains intact in the DRAM segment with shipments making up 13% of total system shipments, compared to 15% in the prior quarter. There appears to be a stabilization of the supply demand balance and we are seeing positive momentum in the marketplace as a result. Demand is strengthening, but by content growth in both smart phones and servers. Spot pricing is showing improvement.","System shipments into the foundry segment was a bright spot as Martin mentioned and increased to 36%, which was up from 27% in the June quarter. The system shipment dollars in foundry represented a record high level for Lam Research. Foundry spend was bias toward investments to execute 10 nanometer ramp and 7 nanometer pilot projects. We also saw continued spend predominantly in the China region at the 28 nanometer and above nodes. And finally the logic and other segment came in at 8% of system shipments up from 7% in the June quarter. Logic spending was largely in support of conversions to the 10 nanometer node.","We set a new record for revenue in the September quarter. Revenue came in at $1.632 billion, which was a sequential increase of 6% and a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was a little lower than the midpoint of guidance at 45.2%. As I previously stated, we expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in our gross margin due to factors like business volumes and mix. And I'll remind you, the financial model is the best reference to help you analyze our ongoing financial performance. And I look forward to sharing an update to the financial model with you at our Investor Day in November.","Our operating expenses for the quarter were $372 million, which was an increase of 3% from the $361 million in the June quarter and it held steady at about 23% of revenue. OpEx spending allocated to R&D was again at benchmark levels of 63% of total spending in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was again strong at $366 million, an increase of 2% compared to the $359 million in the June quarter.","Operating margin decreased slightly to 22.4% down from 23.2% in the prior quarter primarily due to the lower gross margins. The September quarter tax rate came in at approximately 12%, which was a little bit higher than the 10% rate last quarter primarily due to changes in the level and mix of jurisdictional income. A rate in the low to mid teens for the December quarter would be a reasonable number for you to use in your modeling.","Earnings per share for the September quarter were $1.81 based on a share count of approximately 178 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the remaining 2016 convertible note warrants with a total dilutive impact of about 15 million shares on a non-GAAP basis.","As the stock price continues to rise, the convertible notes will continue to add to the diluted share count albeit at a decreasing rate of increase. Dilution schedules for the convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with your modeling. We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases during the quarter.","Let me now turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the September quarter, we had $7.47 million in cash on the balance sheet. In line with the plans we stated during our call earlier this month, at this point we have redeemed the $600 million 2023 senior notes and the $1 billion 2026 senior notes under the special mandatory redemption provision of those notes. The $800 million 2021 senior notes will remain outstanding and will be used for general corporate purposes and other purposes as can be found in the prospectus.","If our pro forma for the cash we returned to bondholders in October, we would have finished the quarter with $5.83 billion on the balance sheet. Roughly 40% of this cash is currently domestically available. And I will remind you, we continue to generate between 20% and 25% of cash domestically on an ongoing basis. Cash generation continues to be healthy at the company. In the September quarter, we generated $473 million in cash from operations, which was an increase of 12% sequentially and an all-time quarterly high for the company.","Days sales outstanding for the period improved to 72 days from 74 days with the shipment profile slightly more linear than it was in June. Inventory turns improved from 3.5 times to 3.9 times. At the end of the September quarter, the deferred revenue balance was $704 million, a 24% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $65 million from shipments to customers in Japan that will convert to revenue in future quarters. And I'll remind you that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on the balance sheet.","Company non-cash expenses during the quarter included the following: $39 million for equity compensation, $39 million for amortization, and $36 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $42 million, which was down from $52 million in the June quarter. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,800 regular full-time employees. We added headcount during the quarter primarily to meet customer needs for additional factory output and field support. Additionally, we added resources to continue our investment in product development.","Let me now turn to our outlook for the December quarter. I'd like to provide the following non-GAAP guidance. We expect shipments of $1.85 billion plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1.84 billion again plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 46% plus or minus 1 percentage point. We are forecasting operating margins of 25% plus or minus plus 1 percentage point.","And finally, we forecast earnings per share of $2.18 plus or minus $0.10 based on a share count of approximately 170 million shares. This earnings-per-share number excludes roughly $37 million associated with the interest expense, one-time fees and accelerated cost associated with the retirement of the 2023 and 2026 notes as well as the term loan commitments.","With our year-to-date results and the strong guidance I just provided for the December quarter, we anticipate that calendar year 2016 will be another record year of financial outperformance for the company, a fifth consecutive year of growth outpacing that of the industry as a whole.","Before transitioning to the Q&A session, I wanted to pick up on Martin's earlier comment regarding our Investor Day, which is now on November 18. We\u2019ve decided to host the event in New York to make the event more convenient for a larger group of investors and analysts that are following the company. We look forward to seeing you in New York on the 18th.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. Martin, first one is, if I look at your December guidance compared to the model that you guys have given in the past, it looks like the quarterly WFE is running at close to $37 billion, $38 billion. You guys are annualizing at well over $8 in EPS. Is it fair to assume that next year is really going to be a modest growth to the extent you can characterize it, should we assume sequentially in the next couple of quarters should decline from the December quarter? And I also had a follow-up.","Martin Anstice","Krish, as is customary for us, we really don't comment specifically about quarter to quarter transitions and inflections. What we\u2019ve tried to provide some perspective on today are some very significant and underpinning market references for you and for us as a company and whether it's a very favorable outlook relative to a universally adopted 3D NAND transition at this point or perhaps more specifically to the company, our share momentum in logic and in foundry, we feel like the objectives for the company that are currently defined by the long-term financial model, we are executing kind of well within that, maybe a little ahead of that and certainly the expectations we have at this point for calendar 2017 slightly stronger with a bias to memory compared to this year, which bodes well for outperformance for Lam.","Krish Sankar","Got it. And as a follow-up if I can ask on 3D NAND, if you look at the NAND install base, it\u2019s about 1.4 million wafer starts and you guys said exiting this year 3D NAND will be at 425,000 wafers. If 3D NAND is going to help replace hard disk drives eventually is the potential install base larger than the 1.4 million that we have or had for planar or the fact that 3D has more density or bits in a given wafer it actually offsets the actual install base growth over time? I'm just kind of curious to your view point on that.","Martin Anstice","I think our viewpoint is a bit of both. I mean there's density on wafer for sure, but our view is even in the time horizon of calendar 2017, we end calendar 2017 with more wafer starts than we began the year. And just in context, the 700 reference that I think most people have for next year now when they describe the shift 3D NAND capacity by the end of calendar 2017, that 700 probably qualified as 600, that 600 is probably no more than 40% of the install base as 3D NAND capable. So we are in the very early stages of a multiyear transition and we think that's a pretty compelling part of the Lam Research story.","Krish Sankar","Thanks, Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Stephen Chin with UBS. Please go ahead.","Stephen Chin","Great, thanks. Congrats on the execution Martin and Doug.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Stephen.","Stephen Chin","Just a follow-up question on the shipment, so the second half of this year shipments looks like they will end up 17% higher than the first half. I remember when you first looked at the second half of this year, you thought it was going to be flat and it improved over the last few quarters. Can you share any color on how you see the first half of 2017 versus the second half of this year?","Martin Anstice","On the basis that I think from the beginning of this year, I was the idiot of the industry that was talking about the stronger second half. I'm going to reserve judgment and claim that it's too early to have commentary on the first and second half next year. I mean we\u2019ve kind of put on the table for you, a reference for higher WFE, I think, it's kind of modest. It's probably a single-digit increment year-over-year and there are a lot of moving parts that could potentially make it a very evenly distributed year, make it first half a little stronger and make it second half a little stronger. So, more \u2013 more maybe in the analyst meeting, much more \u2013 likely more commentary on first half, second half early next year.","Stephen Chin","Okay, thanks. And then just a question on customer concentration. Can you just share your early thoughts on the December quarter shipments? How it looks, memory versus foundry logic?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Stephen, it's Doug. I think both are continued to be relatively strong in the next quarter.","Stephen Chin","Okay, thanks, Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I guess two questions for me as well. To follow-up, if you think WFE is going to up modest, call it, 2%, 3% or so next year. Could you just maybe help us understand what do you think your SAM or your revenue opportunity would look like in that scenario where WFE is up 2% to 4%?","Martin Anstice","We got kind of a couple of ways to answer that. One of them is take a look at the long-term financial model that will be updated in November for you at least as far as kind of giving you at least another year of visibility in terms of our expectations. Another reference for the company is the stated ambition from a market share growth perspective. So we've got two references for you, we've got the long-term market share growth with 3 to 5 percentage point references, we\u2019ve talked about many times 1 to 2 percentage points through technology nodes and there's also a commentary on SAM expansion.","And the headline for the company, if you go back to a 2012 reference point is, we had a portfolio of products that was competing for about 25% or so of wafer fabrication equipment spending. That's in the 33%, 34% range probably this year and we expect in excess of 35% to be the competitive reference point for us, the proportion of WFE that we're competing for with our portfolio next year. Some part of that is a commentary on the product portfolio of the company as we invest and make available more product to our customers and some part of it is the technology inflection in patterning and 3D NAND, which has a natural bias to the etch and deposition segments of WFE.","Amit Daryanani","Fair enough. That's helpful. If I can just follow-up, the December quarter guide obviously very strong in revenue and shipment, I'm curious do you feel there\u2019s some little pull that's going on maybe in the memory side from your customers for their CapEx plans and that's why they are somewhat better or is this just a reflection of good end demand, doesn\u2019t mean March will be down more dramatically than normal?","Martin Anstice","It's kind of really hard to kind give opinion on kind of pull or push. I mean the reality is the year is a little stronger than we expected when we last talked to you in our earnings call and it's a little stronger in 3D NAND and also in foundry. So if that's your definition of kind of pull and I guess the answer to your question is yes. But are we communicating to you an expectation that this is pull that is over exuberant and it\u2019s a risk of creating a whole shortly, I think the answer to that question is no. We see compelling value propositions in 3D NAND and compelling value propositions in the 10 and 7 nanometer logic foundry investments. They are going to go up and down a little bit quarter to quarter and pull in and push out, but fundamentally the long-term headline is the most relevant one as far as the value of our company is concerned.","Doug Bettinger","And that's why we suggested that to you we see next year a little bit stronger as well.","Amit Daryanani","Fair enough. That's perfect. Thank you, guys.","Martin Anstice","Thanks, Amit.","Operator","We will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.","C.J. Muse","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question trying to, I guess, dig a little bit deeper into the 3D NAND side and curious when you think about greenfield versus conversions in calendar 2016 and your current outlook for calendar 2017, is that a headwind or a tailwind for you particularly when you think about next year being a year really for 64 layer count?","Martin Anstice","I don't know C.J., it's terrifically difficult to answer a question like that, it has so many moving parts. This year is a headwind most significantly because of memory and logic foundry kind of spend mix for the company. At a 3D NAND level, the story is really positive for the company in conversions and vertical scaling, but it's also really positive compared to overall WFE and greenfield as well. So probably it gets a little bit better as people step from greenfield to conversion, but it's really hard to give you a simple answer to a very complex modeling question.","C.J. Muse","Okay. I guess I'll take a stab with second one then. Deferred revenues have grown considerably over the last year and just curious I guess as part of that, does that really speak to your new products and new wins and timing of revenue rack and as part of that when you think you'll start to catch up and will see that flow through to the revenue line?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, C.J. a little bit of it might be some aspect in new products, but more importantly it's a fact that we've been growing shipments fairly consistently and when you have a profile where shipments are on a growth trajectory, deferred revenue typically builds and revenue lags as a result. When shipments level off, you will see revenue then catch up with shipments. So that's the way you should expect that the fact that shipments have been outpacing revenue is why deferred revenue was built.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks C.J.","Operator","We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you very much. I guess I have two questions. First for Doug, really on cash, it seems like there's maybe $1 billion worth of excess onshore cash today and if I look at your free cash flow, you are going to probably generate $1.5 billion roughly a year and that would imply maybe another $350 million to $400 million of onshore coming per year and only half of that is being consumed by your dividend. So clearly you have a lot of flexibility there on the cash. Can you talk about how you think about repurchases versus dividend?","Doug Bettinger","Yeah, Tim, why don\u2019t you come see me on November 18, I'll give you some clarity at that point. I don't have anything to tell you until then.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. All right, thanks. And then I guess, Martin, I'm going to try to come at this wafer run rate question a little bit differently. This year if the WFE is going to be $34 billion, which is now what you're saying, you're going to be about 18.5% share, that\u2019s flat despite a very difficult year in DRAM, so that's great for you. But if I use the 18.5% number in your guidance in Q4, it implies that the industry is run rating WFE at roughly $40 billion in the fourth calendar quarter, which is a pretty heavy number. So I guess my question is, do you argue with that math on where the WFE run rate is for Q4? I'm just trying to see how shipments can't come down here even if the next year is good WFE year?","Martin Anstice","I guess one of the advantages of the gray hair I have is I know how to answer that question now. So I don't even try to argue or defend or rationalize or justify because as we\u2019ve said many times, Tim, we understand our SAM really well. We understand our share of SAM really well. We don't understand frankly speaking the SAM of \u2013 the rest of the industry for products that we don't have and we just kind of back into a WFE reference to the best of our abilities. So I don't really have an ability to kind defend, argue, answer a question about WFE because it's just kind of an extension of a very well thought through SAM and quite exactly what the cycles of spending are for other parts and quite exactly what their pricing strategies are, I guess you got to ask everybody in industry to kind of pull it all together. Our view is the best one we\u2019ve articulated.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, Martin, thanks. You guys are usually very good at WFE, so that's why I asked. Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks.","Martin Anstice","No problem, Tim. Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Farhan Ahmad","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just had a question on NAND. In terms of your planar NAND -- in terms of the planar NAND install base, it\u2019s about 70% of the overall capacity, what kind of productivity improvement or bit growth are you seeing on that install base? And is it fair to assume that the vast majority of bit growth going forward needs to come from 3D NAND?","Martin Anstice","I think yes is the answer to that question. I'm sure every customer in the world is working to make more productive their planar capacity particularly in the context at the end of this year the majority of the install base for NAND is still a planar capable investment. But certainly I think kind of the growth of the industry and the chosen technology that is now kind of universally adopted has the focus on 3D NAND.","Doug Bettinger","On 3D, yeah, for sure.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. And then just one question in terms of how the WFE is tracking for last couple of years versus the semi-revenue growth, I mean, last year semi-gap companies were all up, close to double digit, if you combine all the revenues and this year also it\u2019s like very healthy growth and next year is also very healthy growth and we haven't seen that much semi-revenue growth. Have you thought about like what's the main drivers, which are giving you more of the growth related to the semi-industry?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I mean, at a company level, obviously, there are two basic headlines. One of them is the proportion of WFE that we're competing for, which to my earlier answer is kind of transitioned from the 25% level to the 35% level since 2012. So we're competing for $3 billion more business each year if you just want to pick a $30 billion WFE reference. We're competing for $3.5 billion if you want to pick a $35 billion reference. And some part of that is a product portfolio message to the company and some part of it is the technology inflection the patterning and 3D NAND or 3D device architecture transitions for the industry. That's kind of message number one.","And message number two is share gain. And we've had some pretty significant messages on share gain. We talk to you in our last earnings call, if my memory serves me right about double-digit share gain in the planar to 3D NAND transition and we\u2019ve talked today about a fairly unique story we think in the industry in the logic and foundry space at least as best we can analyze were one of very few companies that has demonstrated share gain in logic foundry combined in recent technology node transitions and we are just beginning to see the evidence of that show up in our financial statements.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you. That's all I have.","Martin Anstice","Thanks, Farhan.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jagadish Iyer with Summit Redstone.","Jagadish Iyer","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Martin, if I take your NAND shipments this year, give or take you are up like almost about 75% and if bit growth for next year is similar to this year and I layer in your commentary on spending, how should we think about your growth in NAND shipments as you look at 2017 given where your market share is and where the industry is transitioning to 64 layer and will it be consistent with this year or could it be higher or lower?","Martin Anstice","Well, I mean the overall kind of story for the company in 3D NAND, we are targeting to be more positive proportionately next year than this year and that's a commentary on our best understanding of the conversion strategies of our customers and our targets and plans to systematically introduce more products to compete for more SAM and to make more competitive the products that we have to get a bigger share of it. Now there are no kind of pendulum swings in this industry, it's pretty rare that you accomplish major swings in any one year. And so I think the performance of the company will be a continuation if we keep executing of the last couple of years and that continues to be our focus.","Jagadish Iyer","Okay. I have a brief follow-up. You talked about foundries trying to digest some capacity for 2017, clearly there is one leader there, but how should we think about other foundries trying to catch up to this preeminent leader here to as they try to ramp to 10 or 7 nanometer? Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I mean, obviously, you have to ask them not us, but clearly the opportunity that exists from demonstrated performance benefits at the 10 and 7 nanometer technology nodes make it a very strategic and legitimate target for every foundry and certainly from the seat we have. Everybody is focused on doing their best to get their fair share, however, they define that technology inflection and none of this is easy, and so we support all of our customers and whatever ambition they have to the best of our abilities. So I sense people are broadly focused on it in doing the best they can.","Doug Bettinger","I would just point out that we're continuing to see nice investment profiles at 28-nanometer and above, and obviously that stuff is much broader based.","Jagadish Iyer","Thank you. ","Operator","I\u2019ll take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. ","Romit Shah","Yes, thank you and congratulations on the strong results. Martin, I just wanted to ask as it relates to China, we've been all looking for evidence that the local vendors there will start spending in both foundry and memory, and I just wanted to get your sense on that region and if it's something you're anticipating to at least hear about it as we get into next year?","Martin Anstice","Yes I think for sure there are ambitious plans stated and there are active discussions I think between customers and potential new domestic customers in China with Lam and presumably with every other equipment company. Our position and presence in China is historically very strong in etch and deposition both. I think we have kind of good platform and as best we can tell there are up to 20 active projects certainly that we are focused on tracking in China and I think the spending or at least the significant spending is more likely to be a calendar 2018 statement then calendar 2017 but I think there's a decent amount of statements that towards the end of 2017 we could start seeing something emerge. So that's the best I can give you at this point.","Romit Shah","That's helpful. Thank you. ","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Romit.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Edwin Mok","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to ask back on your foundry logic share gain that you talked about and maybe take a little deeper and can you kind of give us some color where your driving the share gain? Is it on the \u2013 you guys have been very strong patenting, is that one area that is driving share gain? Is it around other area I think it is working very strong in tungsten maybe give us some color one step more detail color around the share gain around foundry logic?","Martin Anstice","I think you just did a pretty job answering your own question. Clearly, the single biggest SAM expansion in foundry logic is patenting. We got some pretty important headlines that a company unique I think relative to microprocessor share gain momentum. And our presence in share gain our both etch and deposition and they are frontend and back end as far as interconnect as well as [indiscernible] footprint. So pretty holistic, pretty comprehensive and patenting is obviously a key driver. ","Edwin Mok","Okay, great. And then just a focus on the foundry logic area as well, I think some of your peers are more upbeat about the coming year thinking foundry logic to grow little more and you mentioned some digestion on 10 millimeter. Do you think that trade of nature growth will not be big enough to offset any digestion in 10 millimeter and some of the customer need to spend too much, do you think they won't be a big spender in 2017?","Martin Anstice","I say our view and it's still forming. We are a long way from being definitive on it. We said kind of flattish to maybe slightly down is the reference we have for Foundry. We do expect that 28 nanometer and above investments in 2017 will be greater than they were in 2016, but to your point, that's a capacity addition that is much cheaper than a leading-edge capacity addition. Whether it turns out to be sufficient to make a neutral or grow kind of time will tell. As best I can tell from customer disclosure, there's kind of a common view that capital intensity in foundry is assumed to be kind of flattish and certainly we are not a position to message any different from that. There's clearly a large amount of investment going in this year for 10 and commitments and significant interest in what I think now is generally accepted to be more valuable and probably more significant technology now to 7 and that looks like that's more of a second-half statement than first half at this point. ","Doug Bettinger","It\u2019s still kind of early for us to have a formulated view on 2017 as we get closer to 2017 itself and we would normally give you more color when we are a quarter further down the road, so check back with us in a quarter, we will give you an updated view.","Edwin Mok","That's helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Joe Moore","Hi, thank you. I had a couple of questions on smaller product areas. Can you talk about events packaging, seems like we're starting to see some more consumer-oriented products coming out again in the end of this year, could that be a decent driver for you guys next year?","Martin Anstice","Well, certainly systems integration and packaging are very prominent parts of the strategies of our customers to overcome the limitations of physics in the frontend. And I think demonstrated performance and cost benefits showing up there. It's one of four technology inflections that we identified three or four years ago now that are relevant to the future of our company. It was then and still is the smaller of the four, but as time passes the through-silicon via etch position and strength that we have becomes more valuable and obviously the presence of the company in interconnect, copper position is also very strong. So over time I would expect the advanced packaging SAM to be more relevant and I think you know from prior disclosure where we are strong and where we are not.","Joe Moore","Great thank you. And also on the image sensors side, have you seen any signs of life, signs of recovery in that segment? Thank you.","Martin Anstice","I would say not as strong right now as it has been but reasonable evidence that strength is beginning to emerge. So whether that's the first half or second half kind of reality, we will see.","Joe Moore","Great. Thanks so much. ","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead. ","Weston Twigg ","Hi, thanks. Just wondering first on DRAM, you said you expected DRAM WFE to be up a little bit next year. Wondering if you're seeing any signs of new DRAM capacity activity or really just no transitions at this point? ","Martin Anstice","I think it\u2019s more of a no transition statements. I mean arguably there are kind of 50,000 wafer starts per month contractions in one year and maybe additions in another year. And if I were to place a bet I would say we probably end next year at or about the same in terms of wafer starts that we began the year. But as you know, this has been a year of significantly reduced spending. Our estimate is the DRAM investment is down 40% this year. By the end of this year, we believe that approximately 50% of the installed base is 20-nanometer capable. So there's a pretty significant opportunity for value creation for the customers in terms of cost-reduction and performance from continued conversion. And as is also true, the 1x world for DRAM is just beginning in calendar 2016 and we think we will be the primary change to the installed base in calendar 2017. And if I were to guess, I would guess that at the end of next year about half of the installed base in DRAM is the 20-nanometer, maybe a quarter of the installed base is 1x and a quarter of the installed base is 25 or above. So I think that's approximate segmentation of the 1.1 million wafer starts depending on how you calculate it is kind of what we're looking at right now. ","Weston Twigg","Okay, good. And then similarly in 3D NAND, you said WFE was up and you mentioned 700,000 installed wafer starts by the end of next year but do you see that number biased higher as well the way things are tracking? ","Martin Anstice","I said just on the 700, I said that was kind of the shift capacity statement that we're coming up with and I\u2019m seeing other people say the same thing slightly above 700 and that compares with the 425 that I referred to today in my prepared comments for the end of calendar 2016. And our estimate is that probably there's about 100 or slightly more than 100,000 wafer starts unqualified at the end of this year, probably a similar number at the end of next year and obviously that exists in the context of 1.5 million wafer starts per month of capacity by the end of next year. So a little bit more capacity and a lot more 3D NAND but in relative terms still 3D NAND installed base is the minority of the installed base by the end of next year.","Weston Twigg","All right, very helpful. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, West.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and I thought I'd jump on the quarterly execution and on the outlook. On your view on DRAM spending being higher next year, clearly the customer base here remains pretty disciplined, very focused on profitability. I appreciate the view from the prior question on the capacity in 2x versus 1x. Can you guys just remind us your SAM growth going from 2x node to the 1x nanometer node and what application is that SAM growth coming from? ","Martin Anstice","I'm not sure I have something to hands to answer that question, Harlan. I apologize. Obviously at a macro level when we last reported our $3 billion SAM reference, we framed the SAM growth opportunity in DRAM at the 50% to 60% level through calendar 2018. And in the patenting area specifically which is the single biggest kind of market expansion in DRAM that's relevant to our company, we characterized 15 to 25 steps at 20-nanometer going to 25 to 30 steps at 1x. So that's about as helpful as they can be at this moment and we will take that question as long as well as I think it was CJ's question earlier around the SAM for each of the three NANDs implementation scenarios and we will try to get some more information for you at the analyst meeting.","Doug Bettinger","We will update that page for you, Harlan. ","Harlan Sur","All right, thanks for the insights there. And then on the record shipment outlook, I'm wondering if you're starting to structure manufacturing capability. As I think about the potential for more growth for the team in 2017 I'm wondering if you can just give us a view on what is the upper limit from a shipment dollars perspective that you can accommodate from a manufacturing perspective on a quarterly basis.","Martin Anstice","Yes. We actually have more flexibility than perhaps you realize. It takes a huge amount of effort so these are not kind of five minute investments. We are constantly assessing not just capacity in our own factories but our supply chain and in our field service organizations for the installation because if you can make something we can\u2019t install it you have a problem, if you can install it but not make it you have a problem, if you can make it but not buy it you have a problem. A lot of effort focused on that. We have nor will we ever have disclosure that speaks to the maximum capacity of the company but it is more flexible. We are challenging and stretching the entire company to be honest, but we believe we are executing with appropriate discipline and we are making investments to make sure that we have capacity to meet the expectations of our customers and continue to position the company for sustainable growth. So lots of moving parts, very complex, but we feel like we are doing a pretty good job all things considered.","Martin Anstice","Yeah, Harlan, we have a phenomenal supply chain organization. These guys are just super good at what they do. So the execution of the company has been really, really good from those guys.","Harlan Sur","Thanks for the insights.","Martin Anstice","Thanks, Harlan.","Operator","We will take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari","Great. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter. I just had one on gross margins. I appreciate the quarter to quarter volatility here, but I was hoping you could discuss a little bit more what drove the slight miss in Q3? And for the current quarter you're guiding gross margins to improve marginally despite a pretty big revenue number. Is this as good as it gets from a gross margin perspective or is there a leverage left in the model? Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Toshiya, I would just point you back to the existing disclosed financial model, it\u2019s the best way to be thinking about the company and, obviously, I will give you an update on that when we get to November 18. We are not going to apologize for a 30 basis point -- slight below midpoint on gross margin, it\u2019s really hard with all the moving parts and different customer mix, things you have going on, there is always going to be variability. And we\u2019ve been pretty consistently in that 45 to mid-46 gross margin range and that's kind of where the business runs. It runs pretty effectively.","Martin Anstice","I think in context again just to kind of put some more substance around what Doug just said, our long-term model for calendar 2015 and 2016 in a world of $35 billion WFE, which we think is greater than the world\u2019s we are actually living in. We said we would aim for $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion revenue range. The sum of our quarter results and guidance are at $6.3 billion. So, at a revenue level, there's commentary on SAM and share, we are performing higher than we indicated in our long-term financial model.","In terms of targeted profitability levels, which includes gross margin and the investments in operating expenses and as we said many times, our focus more is [59:30] and gross margin. Our long-term model said, we were targeting a 22 percentage point operating income and the sum of the results and guidance we\u2019ve just given a 23%. The long-term model also said there was a range of EPS targeted between $6 and $6.75 and by the way a lower share count because when we put the model out, we weren't signaling to you that we would be in essentially a blackout period for 12 months because of the KLA transaction, but against that $6 to $6.75 EPS reference, sum of our results and guidance today are about $7 dollars.","So, I kind of would like you in context if I may ask for that, I think the company's performance financially is really nicely balancing growth and profitability and the trick here is balance. It is super easy to drive profitability up and not grow. It is really hard to architect a vision and then perform consistent with delivering profitable growth that's our vision. And that is what we believe we are executing and delivering and, of course, if you remember of Lam Research, long may that continue.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Toshiya.","Toshiya Hari","I appreciate that. Thanks very much.","Operator","We will take our final question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. I just have one question regarding some of the foundry logic commentary you've highlighted today. Within the context of 10, 7 nanometer node that appears to be \u201cone big node\u201d again, some of the share wins that you talked about at 10 nanometers, are those simply going to transition to send 7 nanometers or are there more potential application wins that you can get at the 7 nanometer node on its own?","Martin Anstice ","As I know that you know Patrick nothing is quite as simple as it just transfers, but obviously demonstrated performance at 10 nanometer for [61:36] one is a very strong reference point for selection at 7 and we feel very confident about that. We are investing to achieve more than \u2013 more market share at 7 than we have at 10 and I believe there are some pretty compelling reasons why we can deliver that. Again consistent with our long-term aspirations of the 3 to 5 and 4 to 8 percentage points that we have for each of the product lines of the company.","Patrick Ho","Great. Thank you. ","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Satya Kumar","Thank you for joining us for the conference call today.

Please go ahead.","Satya Kumar - Lam Research Corp.","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Lam Research quarterly conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, we'll share our outlook on the business environment, review our financial results for the June 2016 quarter, our outlook for the September 2016 quarter and provide an update on our planned business combination with KLA-Tencor. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 PM Pacific Time this afternoon.

As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Martin.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Thank you, Satya, and thank you all for joining us today for our quarterly earnings conference call. The headline is that we delivered strong results that continue to reinforce our increasingly strong presence in the industry, as the enabling technology inflections continue to intensify around etch and deposition processes.","In addition, the quality of our earnings rises as a higher proportion of our market share occurs in critical applications, which are characterized by extreme technical complexity and multi-year cycles of learning for the company.","Lastly, our expectations for performance in the second half of calendar 2016 are stronger than previously articulated. We believe that with sustained focus on execution in partnership with our customers, multi-year outperformance opportunity is set to continue. Lam's shipments, revenue and non-GAAP gross margins were above the mid-points, and non-GAAP earnings above the high end of our guided ranges for the recent quarter.","I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the support of our customers and the contributions of all Lam employees, without whom our performance would not be possible. I would also like to recognize the support we have received from our suppliers who have helped us to ramp our capacity, increase responsiveness to customers, increase localization and support our rapid product development cycles. Thank you all.","At the core of Lam's outperformance is our culture and values, our close partnership with our customers and our ability to deliver innovative products, service, and capabilities at scale, which directly address key semiconductor manufacturing technology and market inflections such as 3D NAND, multi-patterning, FinFET and advanced packaging.","Our predominant focus is always on increasing the probability of success for our customers, contributing to their stated business objectives. In that context, the importance of these technology inflections and their enabling of new industry growth vectors has never been stronger.","Our leading customers are moving to capitalize on the acceleration in innovation centered on the next wave of industry application drivers such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and connected devices and automobiles. They articulate aspirations to change the world.","Realizing the potential of these application drivers will demand unprecedented scaling of performance, power, and cost for compute, storage, and networking, significantly beyond what is possible with traditional scaling and shrink and Moore's law. In essence, this reenergizing of our industry demands a more holistic approach to systems architecture through the entire semiconductor ecosystem.","In cloud server, storage and networking devices, this revolution is driving significant semiconductor demand for DRAM, NAND, new memory technologies, and over time additional logic chip demand for advanced computation necessary for converting data into actionable information.","Growth in semiconductor content for DRAM, NAND and leading and trailing edge logic is a strong theme also in clients' devices like smartphones, IoT, and connected automobiles to deliver the power of the new industry application drivers and enrich the end consumer experience.","We believe that Lam is in an outstanding position to help drive needed innovation and capitalize on the opportunities presented by current and future inflections. The foundation of the last several years, great employees, strong ecosystem trust, and the increasing quality of product and technology roadmaps delivers an execution track record, proven financial outperformance, and leads to our recognized market leadership position.","Lam's etch and deposition products and their on-wafer performance are vital to our customers' success, no doubt. In partnership, we are enabling multi-patterning-driven scaling and logic and DRAM. We are facilitating cost reduction and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies and supporting increased compute performance and memory bandwidth with FinFET and advanced packaging technology inflections.","One characterization of our strategic relevance is in our expanding market opportunity. As a result of our strategic and operational execution through the last several years, Lam's addressable market as a share of WFE has increased from 26.5% in 2013 to over 30% last year and is on track once again to exceed the performance of overall WFE in 2016.","The 3D NAND inflection in particular has accelerated and is driving a greater than 30% growth in 2016 NAND WFE year-over-year, as our customers' target probably the single largest growth opportunity in all of semis over the next few years. NAND is still in the early stages of penetration with its share of total bits addressable at under 20% of the overall flash and spinning media storage market combined.","Underpinning the strong product cycle for NAND in storage is the visibility provided by the technology roadmap of our customers, which extends well into the next decade. Etch and deposition are the key process technology enablers of 3D NAND, a fact that is perhaps best illustrated by the greater than 2X growth in our non-volatile memory markets over the last two years and exciting multi-year growth outlook going forward.","In addition to the demanding requirements for high aspect ratio etch and cost and technology enabling moldstack scaling and 3D, atomic level processing is growing increasingly importance as storage layer counts scale from 40-plus layers today to over 60 layers next year and eventually to more than 100 layers in the next few years.","Lam has prepared its product portfolio for this trend. Our latest ALTUS system with low fluorine tungsten atomic layer deposition or ALD capability is being qualified at multiple customers. This system enables the next generation 3D NAND and DRAM by delivering an innovative ALD solution with lower fluorine impurities, differentiated stress control, and void free fill properties. Our VECTOR Strata PECVD deposition product is seeing very strong momentum with its industry-leading productivity and film property control for moldstack deposition and is now process tool of record at the significant majority of global 3D NAND customers.","Our dielectric etch installed base for high aspect ratio applications in 3D NAND and DRAM has more than doubled over the last year. This strong performance of the portfolio of our VECTOR Strata and ALTUS deposition and Flex and Kiyo etch products has allowed us to remain on track with our objective first shared with you at SEMICON West a year ago, up 7 percentage points to 10 percentage points of share gain from the 2D NAND to 3D NAND transition.","Another important element of the value we bring to our customers and enabling the growth of our systems market share is our customer support business group, which is leading value creation across the entirety of our 40,000 process modules in the installed base. This organization inside of our company is providing world-class support for our new systems during integrated circuit production ramp and addressing our customers' ongoing and critical operational needs for spares and services over lifetime.","But increasingly, this organization is also contributing highly innovative, differentiated technology, productivity and lifecycle solutions, resulting in substantial served market growth and an increasing revenue stream annuity that supports our investment in our future.","Now turning to a Lam and KLA-Tencor merger update. To reemphasize the points made many times before, the outperformance potential of Lam is set to continue for multiple years we believe. This period of strength we've chosen to harness strategically through the planned business combination of two great companies.","We continue to make progress with anti-trust agency reviews. We are pleased with the overall tone of support from our customers for this investment and without compromising the focus on execution in two standalone companies, the integration planning is in better shape today than was true for Lam and Novellus at this same point in the process","Excitement and substance internally and with our customers is building. We continue to work diligently to receive the necessary approvals and now target completion of our merger in the coming few months.","We have no doubt this is a value creating transaction for our customers and the company, for our employees and suppliers worldwide. The opportunity remains. We are 100% committed to innovate beyond what is possible for the two standalone companies separately to the benefit of the overall semi-ecosystem and add to the potential of Lam as currently defined.","Now turning to an overview of capital equipment spending patterns in 2016. Expectations for global economic growth have remained generally stable since our last report, although there has been some increased uncertainty with the possible effects of Brexit. End market demand expectations for PCs has been relatively stable, and there's evidence of solid growth in low-end smartphones and slightly slower units, but stronger content expectations today in high-end smartphones. We continue to expect solid and long-term demand for leading edge silicon in the enterprise markets driven by the move to the cloud.","WFE for 2016 continues to track to $33 billion, plus or minus $1 billion. Our bottoms-up analytics imply at\/or slightly above the midpoint is most likely. By segment, memory WFE tracks to approximately $15 billion with spending more biased to NAND than DRAM this year and for sure since our last update.","We now expect NAND CapEx to be up over 30%, offset by DRAM CapEx, which we now expect to be down approximately 40%. Logic and foundry CapEx is tracking slightly better than our prior expectations. Spending in these segments is weighted primarily to an addition of 10-nanometer and some pilot 7-nanometer capacity as well as additions at the mature 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer technology nodes with China featuring prominently driven by strength in low and mid end smartphones and IoT devices.","Despite a flattish WFE year with some segment mix headwinds for our company, including a substantial decline in DRAM CapEx this year, Lam once again is poised to outperform WFE in calendar 2016. We are confident that calendar year-over-year revenues and second half 2016 versus first half 2016 trends are very positive. Currently, we anticipate second half shipments will be up mid to high single digits sequentially.","Momentum continues to build in 3D NAND with total 3D NAND shipped capacity at the end of calendar 2016, now tracking to the higher end of the 350,000 wafer starts per month to 400,000 wafer starts per month outlook that we provided earlier. In DRAM, spending remains focused on the 2Z nanometer and 1X nanometer conversions with about 50% of industry capacity converted to 20-nanometer and mid single digits converted to 1X, we believe, by the end of this calendar year.","We remain optimistic on content demand drivers for DRAM in clients and servers, which combined with our customers' prudent responses to managing supply in response to the PC demand weakness earlier in the year are already pointing to early signs of improving supply and demand balance. This sentiment biases us positively for a recovery in DRAM CapEx as we look into the next calendar year.","As we enter the second half of 2016, we are excited by the inflection-driven long-term outperformance opportunities for Lam. Also our strong installed base market share positions across all geographies and when combined with KT, further increased strategic relevance to our customers by providing them more valuable innovation, trusted productivity, and fast solutions.","With that, let me hand the call over to Doug.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Okay. Great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today during what I know is a busy earnings time.","The June quarter results represented a solid conclusion to the 2016 fiscal year. In the quarter, we performed above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics with operating margin and earnings per share above the high end of the range. For the fiscal year, shipments, revenues, operating income dollars, and earnings per share were all at record high levels. We delivered double digit revenue growth fiscal year over fiscal year and operating income dollars and earnings per share that grew at twice the rate of revenue growth.","Moving now to the specifics for the June quarter. Shipments were $1.587 billion, up approximately 10% compared to the March quarter and just slightly below the record high level that we saw in the June 2015 quarter. The combined memory segment made up 66% of system shipments, and that was down from 70% in the prior quarter. Non-volatile memory shipments contributed 51% of the system shipments, and this was up from 43% in the March quarter. The non-volatile shipment dollars represent record levels for Lam Research.","As we progress through first half of the year, 3D NAND investments have accelerated with multiple customers moving forward in their 3D NAND ramp plans. We are continuing to see the expansion of our SAM. And this combined with our success in winning critical applications in the 3D NAND process flows of our customers is driving the financial performance we're delivering.","3D NAND will represent over 95% of NAND shipments for 2016. As we expected, DRAM shipments decreased to 15% from 27% in the prior quarter. Investment is pacing at a rational reduced level in response to market conditions. DRAM spending was predominately focused on 20 nanometer conversions with the continued objective of lowering cost per bit.","PC DRAM pricing seems to have bottomed as the market shifts to server and mobile DRAM. Server and mobile represents roughly two-thirds of the market bit growth this year. System shipments into the foundry segment increased to 27% which is up from 23% in the March quarter.","And as Martin mentioned, foundry spending continues to be broad-based with an increasing contribution from 10 nanometer capacity additions augmented by the ongoing investment at 28 nanometer and above nodes primarily in China. The logic and other segment held steady at 7% of system shipments, which was a level similar to that we saw in the March quarter.","From a geographic standpoint, China continued to be, strong representing 17% of total shipments and 22% of total revenue. June quarter revenues came in at $1.546 billion, a sequential increase of 18% and above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was strong in the period at 46.6% which was a 150 basis point improvement from the 45.1% that we saw in the March quarter. The strength in growth margin was a result of higher business volumes as well as favorable product mix.","And as we've described previously, you should expect to see variability quarter to quarter in our gross margins. And I'd just like to remind you that our financial model is the best reference to help you think about margins over time.","Our operating expenses for the quarter were within our expectations at $361 million which was an increase on an absolute basis from the $350 million in the March quarter, but decreasing to 23% of revenue in the June quarter versus 27% in March. In the June quarter, our spending allocated to R&D was 63% of total spending.","During the quarter, we completed construction on our new R&D lab in Fremont, California. This lab will put us at the state of the art in terms of capability and flexibility to continue to develop leading-edge process capability and productivity solutions.","Operating income for the quarter was very strong at $359 million which was an increase of 48% compared to the $242 million in the March quarter. Operating margin increased from 18.4% to 23.2%, above the high end of the guidance range due to both the higher revenue as well as the stronger gross margin. This operating margin percentage is the second highest level since our acquisition of Novellus in 2012.","Our tax rate came in at 10%, which was lower than the 14% rate last quarter, primarily due to more income from lower tax jurisdictions. A rate in the low teens for the remainder of 2016 would be a reasonable number for you to use in your modeling.","Earnings per share for the June quarter were $1.80 based on a share count of approximately 175 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the outstanding 2016 warrants with a total dilutive impact of about 13 million shares on a non-GAAP basis.","In the June quarter, our $450 million 2016 convertible note matured and was settled for both cash and stock. The stock issuance was offset by the corresponding bond hedge that we had in place. Dilution schedules for the remaining convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.","We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $47 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases in the quarter in line with our previously announced plans around the business combination with KLA-Tencor.","Let me now turn to the balance sheet. We have a very solid cash position of $7.1 billion on the balance sheet, reflecting both the strong performance of the business as well as steps we've taken to increase the cash position of the company during the quarter.","We generated a strong cash from operations of $424 million, which was an increase of 132% sequentially in the quarter. Cash from operations for the fiscal year came in at $1.350 billion, a record high level.","As expected, days sales outstanding for the period improved to 74 days from 86 days, with the shipment profile more linear than in the March quarter. Inventory turns improved to 3.5 times.","We completed the issuance of $2.4 billion in principal value of investment grade senior notes in May. This issuance together with $1.5 billion in term loans completes the required financing for the KLA-Tencor transaction.","The net interest expense associated with the $2.4 billion financing is $4 million and is excluded from our non-GAAP results in this quarter. On a full-quarter basis, the net interest expense from this new debt will be approximately $18 million.","The deferred revenue balance at the end of the June quarter stood at $566 million, an 11% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $132 million from shipments to customers in Japan, which will convert to revenue in future quarters, and recall that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on the balance sheet. I expect that deferred revenue will again grow in the September quarter.","Company non-cash expenses during the quarter included the following: $39 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization, and $36 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $52 million, which was up from $46 million in the March quarter. CapEx projects included investment in infrastructure expansion from an additional engineering lab space to support the growth of the company.","During the quarter, we sold our San Jose campus for net proceeds of approximately $80 million and a gain of $15 million. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This transaction is part of our R&D consolidation into the Fremont site.","We exited the quarter with approximately 7,500 regular full-time employees. The growth in head count was primarily related to growth in factory resources to support the growing business level. Additionally, we added some R&D heads.","So now, looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We're expecting shipments of $1.700 billion, plus or minus $75 million. This midpoint would represent a record level of shipments for Lam Research. We expect revenue of $1.625 billion, again plus or minus $75 million. This midpoint would also represent a record level of revenue.","We expect gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Gross margin is down sequentially due to higher customer concentration in September. We forecast operating margins of 22.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally we forecast earnings per share of $1.77, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 176 million shares. This earnings per share number excludes the $18 million associated with the $2.4 billion KLA-Tencor financing. The net interest expense will be excluded from our non-GAAP results until such time as the deal closes.","We expect both shipments and revenue to be stronger in the second half than the first half with mid to high single digit growth in shipments in the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half. We expect revenue growth in the second half to outpace shipment growth half over half. We expect to deplete some of the deferred revenue balance by the end of the calendar year.","And that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Tim Arcuri with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I had two questions. I guess, first, Doug, I'm not sure if I heard the guidance right, but it sounds like the second half shipment guidance is sort of up mid to high singles. So that would imply that the fourth quarter shipments are down a smidge, they're down maybe $150 million. And I guess \u2013 and my question on that is, we've all heard about some recent big 3D NAND projects that may have sort of pulled into this year, so is that more \u2013 sounds like that's more of a Q3 phenomenon than a Q4 phenomenon? Thanks.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Tim, we've given you a firm number on calendar Q3, and then calendar Q4, it's more directional, that's why it's mid to high single digits, because I don't want to specifically pinned down to exactly what is December, and that's why we've put a range around it. But when we describe it, it represents our expectation for everything that's going on not just in 3D NAND, but foundry\/logic as well.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Just to add to that, Tim, I would say the message that we would very deliberately emphasize is the outperformance opportunity long-term for the company in the inflection space and whether it's multi-patterning with logic or 3D NAND scaling. The ebbs and flows in any one quarter, or ebbs and flows from one customer to another, I mean, they \u2013 I guess, they're interesting at some level. But I think one of the headlines from the industry in the last two months, three months is a very strong strategic commitment to some inflections that fall directly into the wheelhouse of this company because of the intensity of etch and deposition-related process. So, yeah, there's always an ebb and flow, but the headline \u2013 I hope you help us with, which is long-term commitment for customers to inflections that are extremely relevant for the future of this company.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. Good point.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Totally, Martin. Okay, great. And then a follow-up question is on China. So of course, overnight, two of the bigger projects in China, the Tsinghua plant and XMC, they merged to form a new venture. Obviously, they still need IP, but it seems like maybe there is a little more confidence that this project could sort of get off the ground.","I know, Doug, you guys have been a little more, I think, not cautious, but a little more realistic, I'd say on China that it's sort of like an even-sum game. So sort of in light of that recent development, can you talk a little bit about China and whether you're seeing any increased signs that maybe you could see some business from these indigenous projects on the memory side next year? Thanks.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I'll let Martin handle this one.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I think \u2013 I don't really think there's a kind of deliberate kind of tone differentiation for Lam relative to a China agenda. We all see exactly the same thing, more or less at exactly the same time, and what we said, I think, fairly consistently is that, the conviction to an IC 2020 and 2025 agenda appears very solid and robust. There are very strategic actions sometimes involving global companies, sometimes the domestic community. We are tracking at least 20 different fab level kind of ambition statements. And there is a full spectrum of kind of probability associated with each one of those.","There clearly is, over a multiple year timeframe, more than 1 million wafer starts per month out there as a kind of reference point for installed based capacity in China. Relative to it being incremental, for me that's all about performance and cost of devices.","And if the performance and cost of devices out of China can be a catalyst and a trigger for incremental demand, it's kind of positive for a global kind of industry including Lam. So time will tell. But clearly the commitment appears to be there. And as Doug said in his prepared comments, China is not an insignificant part of the revenue for the industry and the company.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah, Tim, just to remind you, whatever happens in China, we are going to be involved substantially. Our share position, our presence there is very strong. So whatever is going on, be it a global multinational or an indigenous Chinese customer, we're extremely well-positioned.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Of course. Okay. Thank you so much.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I wonder if you guys have done any analysis in terms of the current level of DRAM shipments. If you know kind of where we're tracking for DRAM supply next year kind of given the rate of investment we've seen, if you have any thoughts on that?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I think we've done analytics, but we're not going to kind of get ahead of our customers relative to quantitative disclosure. We feel really good about kind of the ASP dynamic in the last several months and the inventory situation generally, I think those are kind of positive trends, the discipline appears to be in the system.","We end the year, we believe, with a smaller installed base than we began the year. There's plenty of opportunity left to improve the performance and lower the cost of DRAM chips from conversions. I've said in my prepared comments, no more than 50% converted to the 20-nanometer technology node by end of year. So we are biased to a positive spending year in DRAM next year. But we're going to hold off on dollars until little later in the year.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then I guess just \u2013 when you talk about that, that's more based on your extrapolating what the DRAM environment will look like next year, or are you sort of hearing forecast from your customers that spending would pick up next year in DRAM?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I guess, the humorous response would be, we don't just make it up. So it's an educated judgment from the analytics of the company and a lot of dialog with our customers. I mean, we try to give you the best perspective we have, and I just did.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question; when you think about an environment with shipments down in Q4, curious how we should think about deferred revenues cascading in given that they're at record levels today and you suggested they would grow further in September. So curious how we should think about that coming through? And then what would the impact be to gross margins?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","So I described an expectation that next quarter deferred revenues will grow again. They grew this quarter. You normally see that when shipments are above revenue, which obviously we've had the last couple of quarters now.","I also described an expectation in the scripted remarks that I expect by the end of the year to deplete some of the deferred revenue, and obviously that will happen then in the June quarter if it's growing in September. So that's the way to think about it.","Gross margin, C.J., I'm really only going to guide at one quarter at a time. There isn't anything magic about the deferred revenue and gross margin. It's more of what the product mix is, the customer concentration, all of that.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Okay. Very helpful. And then I guess as a quick follow-up, hoping to, I guess, dig a little bit into the KT transaction, can you update us on what needs to get done on a regulatory basis? And then whether you can extend the bridge financing beyond October 20? I think I saw that as an important date in the filing. Thank you.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I'll let Doug deal with the financing part of that question. What needs to get done is, we need to get consent from agencies that we haven't got consent from. We're working hard to that. We've obviously communicated to you today a delay relative to our original September reference. We might be lucky and still be pleasantly surprised, but we don't expect to receive consent globally inside of the September quarter. We're targeting before mid October. And obviously the disclosure of the company will stay consistent with our learnings.","We feel the deal is clearly a compelling value proposition to our customers and our company. We feel better about it today as the value proposition than ever. I think even as recently at SEMICON West, we had a couple of customer meetings with clear statements of interest in the joint development activity and the innovation that would be possible when Lam and KT come together. We're targeting closure as fast as practically possible and obviously looking forward to being part of one company.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","And then, C.J., you're right. The term loans have an expiration that would be in the 20th of October and were we still to be going back and forth and we extend the deal timing, then I'd have to go extend those as well. Wouldn't be all that hard to do it.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Okay. Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. Last quarter, the team was somewhat optimistic on second half shipments being up over first half but a little bit tempered just given the DRAM fundamental environment.","Obviously, this call, you seem extremely confident. You even quantified the growth in second half shipments. What segments or programs are driving the better second half view relative to outlook 90 days ago? Is it truly broad-based across memory, foundry and logic or is it skewed towards one segment or the other?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I would say, relatively speaking to the commentary of the company three months ago, it's memory and foundry both and it's exactly where you'd expect it to be of 3D NAND and demand related with broad industry commitment to that technology and it's 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer focused with as best I can tell very good tape-outs and customer engagement commentary from the customers that are making those investments. So it's definitely not just a single segment or limited customer commentary.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the insights there, Martin. And given the stabilization in DRAM pricing, as you mentioned, there is a focus on profitability. As you mentioned, 50% of the capacity may be transitioned to 20-nanometers exiting this year. But there also seems like there is a sense of acceleration on some of the leaders in the space to make the move to 18-nanometer and 16-nanometer nodes. So I'm wondering if you're seeing this reflected in your second half shipment outlook and your thoughts on shipped 1X capacity as we exit this year for DRAM.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I mean I think the essence of fundamental value in these conversions is kind of well understood and I don't think debated. I think appropriately, our customers are disciplined around supply and demand in their respective industry. They're conscious not just of adding capacity, but making money on the chips they build.","And so we are very confident that as the cycle of demand emerges, and there's a decent amount of commentary on content expansion in some of our devices, as well as some positive signs in terms of unit demand on the low and mid end. This will kind of naturally play itself out. So, I don't really think it's a big second-half commentary for us, which is why we've articulated an expectation of calendar 2017 biased to the positive and that certainly when we would expect the supply and demand kind of conversation to be more or less behind us.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","And Harlan...","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the insights.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah, there is a little bit of 1X conversion occurring. But that really is going to be more about what's happening next year.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the insights.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thank you. I just wanted to ask about the deal because there's been uncertainty as to whether or not it's going to go through. And I think part of this stems from what happened last year. You know AMAT, TEL \u2013 yeah, that was a deal that was consistently delayed until it ultimately got killed. And with KLA this is \u2013 from what I understand the second time that you guys have delayed the timing of the closure. So, I guess the question is why should we be more confident that this transaction actually goes through?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I guess I don't really get chance to comment about your confidence. I will tell you that we believe this transaction is fundamentally different than the conversation and the transaction that you just referred to. There is no overlap whatsoever. We strongly believe in the merits of this transaction. We believe it's pro-competitive. We believe that Lam and KT together can innovate and deliver value to our customers beyond what we can do as independent companies.","We are, as you know, from prior disclosure, codifying kind of the behavior that will be relevant to the company with the consent decree conversation, and I think we're on records in prior earnings calls on that point. One part of that obviously is describing our commitment to the entire semiconductor ecosystem relative to availability, supply and support kind of KT products. And that's just kind of part of this process. And we're stepping through and working diligently and collaboratively with agencies. We respect their work products. And as you likely anticipate, the crystal ball of Lam Research doesn't extend beyond the precision that we're kind of currently articulating. So we're doing the best we can to give you our best knowledge and we'll continue to make that commitment.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And Martin, is customer feedback really important and do you feel like there is a difference here with what you guys are trying to do with KLA versus previous deals?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Maybe I don't want to get trapped in a comparison here. I will tell you what I've tried to communicate from the beginning here. Obviously, we're doing this for the benefit of our customers. We believe we can innovate more and contribute more value to our customers and support their technology and economic roadmaps with this transaction.","We believe if we do that, there will be more opportunity for our company and hence all stakeholders benefit. So we believe passionately in that value proposition, and we spent a decent amount of time working the conversation indirectly and sometimes directly with our customers to make sure the strategic choices were lined up with their expectations. There's always an ebb and a flow and I'm sure every \u2013 one customer has a slightly different characterization of this. But I feel, as least as best as I can tell from my personal interactions with customers, there's much more support than not and much more interest in exploring innovation potentials.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. My first question was on 3D NAND. I appreciate 2017 is still a couple of quarters out but was curious how you guys were thinking about 3D NAND spend into next year. Are there enough projects out there? And is the mix broad-based, enough for you to predict another healthy year?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Well, I think if the \u2013 yeah \u2013 I'm going to stay away from quantitative again if I may, but qualitatively, we think this is probably one of the most healthy spaces in the semiconductor industry because there are some very compelling value propositions and growth opportunities for semiconductors with solid state drive technology particularly. So again \u2013 in any one quarter, there's an ebb and a flow precisely how it plays out, but broad industry commitment to this technology and very compelling growth opportunities as we characterized in our prepared comments today .","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up is on EUV. It seems like your customers are warming up to the idea of EUV insertion at the 7 nanometer node. Have you also sensed a slight change in tone as it relates to their approach to EUV? And it would also be helpful if you could help us understand how your opportunity in etch and dep would differ between a world with no EUV and perhaps some EUV? Thank you.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","A gentleman by the name of Peter Wennink is much more qualified to answer your question than I am. So, as we've said a number of times, we are invested in extending immersion and enabling EUV to the best of our abilities, so as an etch and deposition and clean company. And we believe that the inflection opportunities, multi-patterning opportunities in DRAM and logic for us extend into an EUV implementation. So when that happens, which we hope it does in the best interests of the semiconductor industry and our customers, we are there to support, and we believe the multi-patterning growth opportunity continues in that context. So no major tone comment from me at the customer interface because obviously we dialog much more about our business than ASML's.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","You are welcome.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking the question. You, obviously, guided NAND to be little bit stronger this year. I just wanted to probe the linearity of NAND. Do you still see the NAND shipment has been primarily first half weighted?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","It's a little stronger in the first half than the second half, Farhan. It continues, though, to be quite strong as we look into the second half.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And then, Doug, can you talk about how much of the cash is onshore versus offshore?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Well, it has materially changed. All of the $2.4 billion that we raised, obviously, is domestically available. Taking that out, the remaining balance sheet cash, it's still about 20% or 25%. As it pertains to funding the transaction, we have all the domestic cash that we need to complete the KLA-Tencor transaction.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. That's all I have.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Farhan.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go ahead next to Stephen Chin with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Hi, Martin and Doug. Nice results.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Stephen.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Just a question on the customer concentration, it looks like Lam shipments to Southeast Asia were up a lot in the quarter. Was this region mostly one customer? And is Lam likely to see a different top three customer list every quarter? And it's basically just up to you to manage this quarterly customer lumpiness?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. There is primarily one big customer investing in Southeast Asia. That I'm sure you know who it is, Stephen. And, yeah, you're going to see variability quarter-to-quarter as these very large fab projects get undertaken. They will come in and then they will need to ramp and then another one will come in and they will need to ramp. And so you're going to get variability due to that. That's just the nature of this business.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I mean to the manage reference, I don't think we get chance to manage it. We are biased to give our customers what they need...","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","That's right.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","...when they need it to the best of our abilities. And as Doug says many times, that that creates an up and a down, week-to-week, months-to-months, and quarter-to-quarter in every element of our financial statement, and it's tough for you we realize. Hopefully, you realize it's tough for us as well.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","And Stephen just one last comment on this. I mean, I always refer back to the public financial model that we put out there is the best way to kind of think about things over time. When we put that together, we did our best to, kind of, model some level of variability. It doesn't mean it's going to be exactly those numbers, but that's the right kind of medium to longer term way to think about it.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for sharing that color. My follow-up question is on shipments to logic customers. We saw Lam recently win a Preferred Quality Supplier award from Intel last year. Congratulations on that. But we still haven't seen a big inflection in Lam shipments to logic customers. Just curious, if you still see logic as a customer segment that you're confident you're taking market share from and maybe future upside? Thanks.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Absolutely, yes.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. Definitively.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I told them one, Doug \u2013 I know you don't want to comment on December, but I'm just curious if December revenues are flat versus September, would the gross margins be up in December?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Again, I'm only guiding gross margin one quarter at a time. Usually \u2013 everything else equal, if you have a higher level of revenue, margins will tend to be better. But you got all the mix that I've always described. So you can't necessarily just run to that conclusion.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. All right. And then a follow-up for Martin. When you look at the 3D NAND as you go into like 64 layers, 96 layers and beyond, does the etching composition shift more towards dielectric etch versus conductor, or do you think conductor actually remains a major portion of the overall etch market in 3D NAND?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I don't think I have a segment message for you, more or less because I think the productivity solution set that will play out in high-volume manufacturing for the types of vertical scaling that you just described, have perhaps still a lot of work from the entire supply chain and also from the customer. So I would say watch this space, and if we see anything of value to communicate, we will.","Again to reemphasize what I said in my prepared comments, the 2D to 3D transition for us was very strong with a 7 percentage point to 10 percentage point share gain for the company. Another, kind of, couple of data points that I would give you on 3D NAND for the company from a market share perspective.","In general, the development tool of record decisions that translate into production tool of record decisions actually got stronger for us. And the other reference, I would give you is that obviously our presence in critical applications, which is really a commentary on quality of earnings is very, very strong. So we're right at the center of enabling, and that puts pressure on us but we feel really pleased about the position of the company.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Krish.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much. Martin, first in terms of the growing adoption for applications for both atomic layer deposition and etch, what's the market opportunity as a whole that you see for those type of products?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","That's something that, if I may, I'd like to defer to our analyst meeting planned for November because, to your point, atomic level processing \u2013 generally for us, atomic level etch and atomic level deposition is a very central part to the opportunity for growth in the company, and competitive differentiation and also quality of earnings. So I would prefer delay, if I may, until our November meeting on that point.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Fair enough. And then maybe, for Doug, now that you're approaching record shipments, and obviously you've done a really good job up to this point with the high level shipments and probably a lot of pulls and pushes. Can you just discuss or give a little bit of color and some of the tactics, either whether it's the supply chain, manufacturing or how you're managing these record levels, especially as they keep growing?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","I mean as I talked about, we have added resources in the manufacturing organization. You've seen our inventory balances tick up a little bit in anticipation of very strong shipments. And I think specifically the reason Martin in his scripted remarks thanked our suppliers, is they've supported our ramps very, very well. We've been talking to them well in advance of them needing to grow their volumes so that they are going to be ready for this. And I think we've executed extraordinarily well and will continue to. You manage the churn as it happens. And we've got a great global operations group that is really good at what we do.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And thanks for taking my question. So in terms of foundry spending, it looks like the 28 nanometer and 40 nanometer and maybe 200 millimeter as well seems to have a longer life cycle because of low and mid range films phones. How do you think that changes your WFE forecast this year or next year? Or maybe it's just related to your service business, any way you can quantify it?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","I don't know if I'll give you as much as you want. I'll give you as much as you want. 28-nanometer looks to be a very long node. And we're seeing even some 40-nanometer investments occurring. I think it has somewhat to do with low and mid end phones for sure. It's got equal amount to do with kind of where IoT stuff is going and that is how we monetize some of the installed base business as well. We're looking at that very differently in terms of that opportunity. And you're right. Some of the stuff is even 200 millimeter equipment. So we're very focused on it. I don't know if that was what you're looking for. But 28-nanometer is going to be around for a while.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. My follow-up question is curious about your thoughts on another deal in the space between litho company and a process control company. I guess from a KLA perspective, does that change in any way your thoughts on the combined company SAM expansion opportunity?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","No, I don't think it changes our objectives or our strategy. I think in many respects it probably validates the legitimacy of the vision to bring process and process control capability together at some level to innovate for the success of our customers. So it's another data point.","There are others with other peer companies and other competitors. Sometimes it's an acquisitive action like the one you just refer to. Sometimes it's organic. There are plenty of examples now in our the industry where people are employing similar strategies.","If your question maybe more relates to the competitive dynamic between e-beam and optical, our sense is that industry consensus is very complementary technologies. We're not obviously in a position to speak to KLA's business. But from the seat that we have with limited knowledge of the details, the latest generation optical inspection capabilities that KLA has brought to the market appear very robust and getting pretty solid traction.","So, no real change in how we think about it, perhaps further validation of the vision. And to kind of restate what I said before, we're targeting to close this thing and we're working diligently with agencies to get that done. We never have any guarantees, but we're working hard to do that a little later than the September timeframe, targeting right now, mid-October.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Sidney.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi. Yeah, thanks. Actually I had a similar question on the ASML-Hermes deal, but from a different angle, I was looking at it as an opportunity for Lam potentially given that you have a pretty tight relationship with ASML already and they are talking about doing pre-and post etch measurements and creating a holistic litho loop that extends into the process arena. So, I was just wondering, if you could maybe tell us how closely you're collaborating with ASML on this type of application, and if you think there's an opportunity to maybe gain market share, if you can drive customers to use more Lam tools in a holistic litho loop.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I think it's kind of premature for me to start talking about collaboration when we haven't actually closed our deal yet. But, obviously, to your point, the relationship between the companies is good and strong. We work diligently both to support the long-term success of our customers and I see that trend continuing.","So, we all have some version of the same vision I think to deliver more predictable process to our customers, to open up process windows, to deliver their roadmaps with higher quality, lower cost IC devices, and whether we call that holistic litho or holistic etch or holistic dep or holistic process, we've all got our own nomenclature, but I think the strategy and the model of collaboration for our company is set to continue, I hope, for many years.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. And then as a follow-up just looking at the model, guidance implies that OpEx would increase meaningfully next quarter. Just wondering if most of that falls into R&D and if you could give us an idea of what level of R&D increase you're looking at throughout the rest of the next fiscal year?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah, a decent amount of it, Wes, is R&D, and again the right way to think about how we're going to spend money is pinned on that financial model. Obviously as we grow, we need to invest more to continue to grow and that's part of how we think about it. In the back half of the year given a little bit stronger P&L, there's also a general increase in that variable compensation piece that varies with the P&L.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities","That's helpful.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Just extending that answer a little bit further. I don't think we've ever invested more in the future of this company than we are today. I mean, I feel really good about the distribution of operating expenses to R&D and SG&A, I think we kind of set a tone. And whether we're the best in the industry or one of the best, I'm sure you guys can figure out but the 63% reference is something we worked hard for.","If you look at the last several years since 2013, we have increased our investments in R&D by more than 30%. And in that same timeframe, the increase in investments in SG&A is about 10%. So, investing in the future of the company to prepare us for the inflections that we're describing, today's inflection is getting bigger and the next generation inflections central to long term success for the company.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Okay. Perfect. Our last question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yep. Thanks. Glad I stuck in over there. I guess, first off on the KT transaction, could you just talk about what are the concerns that you're hearing from regulators, because the deal seems fairly complementary and no real overlap. I'm curious what's the feedback you're getting. And is there anyone other than the DOJ that's giving you negative feedback or concerns on the deal?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. We're not really in a position to talk about the conversations we're having with regulators. I mean, the essence of this deal, as I said a couple of times, is no product overlap. We believe a compelling and pro-competitive value proposition for the benefit of our customers. We have made broad commitments to the ecosystem relative to supply and availability in support of process control equipments. And the protocols around intellectual property protection are well established in this industry and the company. So, I mean those are the qualitative statements I can make around your question. But the specifics of our dialog with agencies unfortunately we're not at liberty to dialog about.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. And if I just follow up, if get your comments on the back half shipments right, I mean, you're implying December could be down modestly. Is that essentially just a pause that you're seeing maybe on the 3D NAND side, or is something else driving that shipment down in December, and I get it could be lumpy but I'm curious what's the driver this time around in December.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I wouldn't describe it as a pause. I mean there is just a \u2013 every customer has their own cycle of investment. And they can't continue to jam tons of capacity into their fabs like forever so they add and then they pause a little bit, but there's no generic kind of industry cycle type pause commentary that we can make. And frankly I don't think we'll ever be able to make. I think the industry is very different today as a result of consolidation.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. It's just timing of projects. I mean it's nothing more than that.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Thank you.","Satya Kumar - Lam Research Corp.","Operator?","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now hand the program back over to Satya Kumar for any additional or closing remarks.","Satya Kumar - Lam Research Corp.","Yes. Thank you everyone for joining our conference call. Our Analyst Day is scheduled for November 16. Do make a note of that. We've issued a press release on that. Thanks once again.","Operator","And that does conclude today's program.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Lam Research Corporation December Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Shanye Hudson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Lam Research Corporation's quarterly conference call. Here with me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ernie Maddock, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Shortly, Ernie will discuss the financial results for the December 2011 quarter. Martin will then share Lam's business outlook for the March 2012 quarter before open the call up the call up for Q&A.","The press release detailing our financial results was distributed over the wire services shortly after 1 p.m. this afternoon and is also available on our website at lamresearch.com.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements, including those related to our expectations for the further global macroeconomic environment; of market size; wafer fab equipment spending; market share changes; consumer demand; customer spending and behavior; and the factors that will influence those expectations, as well as our spending projections; our investment plans; our business strategies, our aspirations of the benefits of our planned merger with Novellus; our intentions for research and development activities; our contemplated tax rate and our forecast of market share, shipments, revenues, expenses, margins, operating profit, share repurchase activities, earnings per share and cash generation on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as other statements of the company's expectations, beliefs and plans. ","There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements, and a list of these factors can be found in the slide package accompanying this conference call and on our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","All forward-looking statements are based on current information, and the company assumes no obligation to update any of them. ","This call is scheduled to last until 3 p.m. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Ernie.","Ernest E. Maddock","Thanks, Shayne, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We ended the calendar year with a solid performance leading or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance ranges for the December quarter on all financial metrics. ","In calendar year 2011, Lam delivered $2.8 billion of revenue, generated $696 million in cash from operations, representing 25% of revenues and returned approximately $233 million to our shareholders through stock repurchases.","Moving now to the specifics for the quarter ended December 25, shipments were $563 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range and down 3% from the September quarter. Application and market segment breakdown for the quarter were as follows: Applications at 45-nanometer and below represented 90% of overall system shipments, and we further estimate that about 87% of our quarterly shipments were targeted for applications below the 4x technology node. ","System shipments for the memory segment were 42% of the overall total and included NAND at 28% and DRAM at 14% of total system shipments. Foundry shipments were 46% of total system shipments, while logic and other constituted the balance at 12%. ","I'd like to note, the beginning in the December quarter we made a change for our market segment reporting methodology for shipments. Previously our foundry numbers included only pure-play foundries. Starting with this quarter and going forward, we have modified the foundry category to include manufacturers that have a majority of their logic capacity available for the foundry business. These shipments were previously reported in the logic and other category.","December quarter revenues were approximately $584 million, representing a sequential decrease of 14% and coming in better than the midpoint of our expected range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40.1%,  down from 41.7% in the September quarter and in line with the midpoint of our guidance. ","In addition to product mix, our gross margin performance for the quarter was primarily affected by reduced factory and field utilization rates correlated to the lower revenue levels. ","December quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $180 million, down about $2 million sequentially. Versus the September quarter, we had lower levels of variable compensation reflecting lower overall business levels. ","As we highlighted last quarter, our exiting December month run was on an upper trajectory, which we expect to continue in a manner consistent with prior commentary relative to the need for increased levels of headquarters and customer-facing research and development. ","Non-GAAP operating income was $54 million versus $101 million in the September quarter, and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 9.2% above the high-end of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the December quarter was 21.8%, higher than we had anticipated due to geographic income mix. As we previously outlined, our tax rate is highly dependent on our U.S. versus non-U.S. income mix. ","For fiscal tax share planning purposes, we make certain assumptions on geographic income mix and overall profitability levels, and actual results may vary from those assumptions. Going forward, we would expect an overall fiscal year 2012 non-GAAP tax rate in the high-teens to low-20% range. This fiscal year rate includes only a 2-quarter benefit from the R&D tax credit which expired December 2011. ","Based on a share count of approximately 121 million shares, December quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.34 at the high-end of our guidance range for the quarter. The higher tax rate negatively affected our EPS by about $0.02 in the quarter as did the fact that we suspended share repurchases in conjunction with the contemplation of the Novellus transaction. Moving to the balance sheet, our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash and investments totaled $2.4 billion versus $2.2 billion last quarter. In the December quarter, we generated $169 million in cash from operations, up $82 million sequentially. DSO for the quarter were 72 days, up from 70 days in the September quarter, primarily reflecting collection timing differences due to the year-end cutoff. ","Inventory turns were 3.7, down from the September quarter-end performance of 4.0, largely due to declines in September quarter output levels. We exited the December quarter with deferred revenues of $192 million, up from $181 million in the September quarter and as usual, this excludes shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in the future quarters. In December, the revenue value for these shipments totaled approximately $16 million. ","Non-cash expenses include, among other items, $18 million for equity compensation and $22 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $27 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately 3,850 regular full-time employees. ","As a reminder, in December, we announced our new share repurchase authorization of $1.6 billion, which replaced our prior authorization and which is expected to be completed within one year of the closing of our merger with Novellus. ","During the December quarter, due to deal-related restrictions, our trading activity was very limited. We repurchased approximately $10.6 million of our common stock at an average price of $39 per share, and in addition, we settled a $100 million structured repurchase program and received 2.6 million shares. This structured repurchase program was previously discussed on our September quarter conference call. ","Due to the Novellus transaction, we will have only a short open trading window within the March quarter and we intend to execute repurchases during that open window. ","I'll now turn it over to Martin for his comments.","Martin B. Anstice","Thank you, Ernie. Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge that this is my first earnings call following the transition of CEO duties at the end of 2011. Although I've spoken with many of you in the past and most recently subsequent to the Novellus acquisition announcement, it is a pleasure to reengage with the investment community and together with the rest of the Lam team, I look forward to working with you prospectively. ","The wafer fab equipment industry has never been known for its predictability, and 2011 was no exception. The macroeconomic environments remain volatile, highlighted by the European debt crisis, slowing growth in Asia and of course, sluggish performance here in the U.S. In addition, catastrophes in Japan and Thailand created significant disruptions in the consumer electronics and PC supply chains. Combined, this environment caused our customers to be incrementally more cautious despite relatively robust demand for smartphones, tablets and other devices in the year. ","For the equipment market, spending for the second half of 2011 was lower than the first half by a double-digit percentage, and was focused almost entirely on leading edge migrations, which include 32-, 28-nanometer expansion for the foundries, 3x and 2x conversation for DRAM and 2x  and 2y node capacity additions for NAND. We believe that wafer fabrication equipment spending for the year was a healthy $31 billion to $32 billion, up about 9% from 2010. ","As previously communicated for Lam specifically, the combination of customer mix and spending patterns resulted in Lam's served markets declining on a year-over-year basis. Notably microprocessor investments represented nearly 20% of overall spend in 2011 compared with approximately 11% in 2010. Additionally, the profile of equipment purchases for leading edge foundry and logic capacity resulted in expending towards the low-end of its historical range at roughly 12% to 12.5% of the overall wafer fabrication spending, compared with a high 13% range in 2010. ","With this context, we believe our shipped market share performance for 2011 to be in the upper 40s percentage range for etch and the lower 20s percentage range for single-wafer clean, the headline being a relatively neutral year for the company on this metric. ","On application share basis, which is indicative of forward-looking market share momentum, we anticipate positive gains in etch through N plus 1 with 13 new application wins in 2011 primarily in critical front-end-of-line memory and foundry, more successes than not defending positions and the benefit of a transition to conductor etch associated with various patterning and metal hard mask processing schemes. This performance extends to 11 years, our track record as the global market share leader in etch. ","In single-wafer clean, we believe we gained 10 new applications and successfully defended our existing positions. Both the new and defended applications are in areas where we currently hold strong positions and have demonstrated differentiated results. These include back-end-of-line applications and those targeted for the backside of the wafer. ","We also continue to gain traction in the area of high  aspect ratio cleans, where our drying technology has a demonstrated advantage. ","As we talked about in recent quarters, this is a time of significant critical technology and productivity challenges for our customers, and Lam remains strongly committed to making the necessary R&D investments to address those needs. We believe that this commitment will be recognized with the opportunity to gain share on an ongoing basis and continue to target a 3- to 5-percentage share gain in etch and 5- to 10-percentage share again in single-wafer clean over the next 3 to 5 years. ","Specific 2012 focus areas for the company include the expansion of double patterning steps of the 14-nanometer logic node, quadruple patterning for 2y DRAM devices, 14-nanometer FinFET architectures and 3D NAND structures. We are heavily engaged with key customers in each of these areas, some of which could begin production as early as 2013. ","In etch, our ability to tightly control critical dimensions positions us well for these applications. While in single-wafer clean, we continue to leverage our technology differentiation while driving activities to enhance our product capabilities to address a broader range of front-end-of-line applications. ","All said, our strategy has been and remains focused on developing products and services that strengthen our competitive offerings in established markets and on expanding our business through adjacent market growth both organically, through increased collaboration and through acquisitive measures where appropriate. ","While we are limited by what we can share with you today, our recently announced transaction with Novellus is a clear example of executing that strategy. Their position as a market leader in thin-film deposition and wafer surface preparation technologies complements Lam's core competencies and market leadership. It directly supports our stated adjacent growth market growth strategy. ","With Novellus, we are not only adding critical process steps that are directly adjacent to our etch and clean solutions, we are also creating a combined company that is well-situated to accelerate and optimize collective developments of next-generation 300-millimeter and when appropriate, 450-millimeter products and services. ","We plan to share further information regarding our integration plans and expectations for the combined company's performance following the release of our proxy statement in the coming weeks. ","I'd like to now take a look at our early views on 2012.","We believe that the macroeconomic environments will be the single largest influence on 2012 WFE spending variability. Consensus anticipates a slowing of GDP growth globally with risk in the Eurozone and Asia particularly, China and the potential for slight improvements in the U.S. ","Consumer electronics' demand remains healthy and semi revenue should grow as a result, albeit at a modest pace. We anticipate the PC unit growth will be in the low single-digits as the industry recovers from the impact of hard disk drive shortages. ","The emergence of the ultrabook, a generally accepted highlight from CES recently, should lend support to electronics' demand, but we don't expect penetration rates to grow marketably until more competitive price points are reached later in the year. In addition, we expect both tablet and smartphone unit growth of approximately 40% to play a big role sporting customer investments. ","Given this demand profile and following recent capital spending announcements from a few key device manufacturers, we now forecast 2012 WFE spend levels to be in the range of $30 billion, flat to slightly down from 2011. This is an improvement in our outlook. ","As generally acknowledged, DRAM customers are focusing on conversion of existing capacity to the 3x node and below to address their profitability objectives, although it's important to note the contract pricing has stabilized in recent weeks. Overall, we anticipate a continued environment of limited new capacity adds with bit growth in the range of 35% to 40% resulting in flat WFE spending year-over-year in this segment. ","For NAND, contents-rich products such as smartphones and tablets are showing strong demand driving another year of relatively healthy NAND spend with bid growth assumed in the 65% range. A faster ramp for ultrabooks represents an upside for those figures as does a broader and faster SSD adoption, which we're assuming to have approximately a 10% penetration in the mobile PC market currently. ","In the foundry space, we see continued capacity adds at the leading-edge technology nodes, driven by wireless customer demand that appears sustainable. As implied by earlier comments, we are cautiously more optimistic in our 2012 outlook than we were 3 months ago, the big uncertainty being the macro environment.","We believe our performance will be consistent with our previously published financial models and commentary by the company today and since SEMICON West 2011. Specifically, we plan to continue making the strategic investments necessary to successfully position the company for sustainable growth, but are planning to do so with a quarterly spend profile of no more than $200 million operating expenses this year based on our current understanding of opportunities and customer demand. ","As Ernie pointed out, our near-term tax rate has increased by approximately 20% being negatively impacted by geographic revenue mix and timing uncertainty relative to the extension of the R&D tax credit, which expired at the end of calendar our 2011. ","From a market share perspective, this is an important year for the company with meaningful selections anticipated by customers around the many significant transitions and technology inflection points. ","Aside from investing for the long-term growth with a focus on strengthening positions in dielectric etch and front-end-of-line single-wafer clean, we are targeting successful defenses across our product lines and new applications market share penetrations for the 20-nanometer logic, 2x DRAM and 2y 1x NAND nodes. Considering the timing of implementing key customer selections in 2012 and the customer spending profile and 2012 similar to 2011, from a shipments market share perspective, we would expect modest progress to our previously stated 3- to 5-year growth objectives.","In summary, 2012 is a critical year for Lam to continue executing against the company's long-term adjacent market growth strategy. In addition to closing the Novellus transaction and executing on our integration plans to deliver targeted results, I previously outlined a number of important milestones in our strategic customer programs that we will be focused on as they develop the architectures, processes and devices necessary to meet the cost and performance demands. We believe that we are well positioned for these opportunities building a stronger model of collaboration with customers, and that will be a large area of focus for us this year.","Turning now to our outlook for the March 2012 quarter, our guidance is: Shipments of $700 million, plus or minus $25 million; revenues of $640 million, plus or minus $20 million; gross margin at 41%,  plus or minus 1%;  Operating profit at 10.5%, plus or minus 1% and earnings per share of $0.44, plus or minus $0.05. ","With that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes the line of Satya Kumar with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, first off, Martin, could you talk a little bit about the percentage in terms of gross margin drivers as you look into the March shipments, pretty big uptick in terms of shipments. Obviously, the incremental gross margins appear to be going to the 15%, so anything you could talk about that?","Martin B. Anstice","Sure. Yes, I think one of the things that's really important to make a statement on and my sense is this a generally accepted and understood factor is the level of concentration in spending particularly in the March quarter is very high on 1 or 2 significant customers. And that concentration is a very big part of why the gross margin guidance is what it is. I do expect if the mix of customers is more balanced than through the rest of the year, and that's currently what we are modeling that the gross margin percentage that shows up in the March guidance would trend upwards, independent of their being more absolute dollars of revenue. But a big part of the guidance we gave on profitability specifically at the margin level is associated with concentration on 1 or 2 key customers. I didn't get the second part of your second, Satya.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No, that was the first question. I guess the second was could you talk a little bit about how the shipment pipeline might look like as you look into the June quarter?","Martin B. Anstice","I'm obviously limited in terms of the visibility that we always have prospectively. But I think it's fair to say that the shipments' guidance of the company, which is a reasonably reliable leading indicator of kind of outlook is stronger than the revenue guidance for the quarter. And so certainly as we see it today, we would expect continued strengthening. But as we all know, customers can change their plans pretty quickly. But that's we are -- what we're seeing today. In terms of the kind of segmentation, there's a fairly strong segmentation to kind of the foundry community -- the new definition that Ernie reported and disclosed a little earlier. So about 50% of the shipments in the March quarter is directed to that segment.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Mark Heller from CLSA.","Mark Heller - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I guess, Martin, you gave a wafer fab equipment forecast of about $30 billion for 2012. I'm just wondering how you think that shapes up sort of first half versus second half. Would you expect --  I know, I mean, what type of visibility, I guess, would you have for the second half of this year? And do you expect the first half maybe to be stronger than the second half?","Martin B. Anstice","We're certainly in terms of kind of a planning processes in the company. We're certainly anticipating a slightly stronger first half and second. But frankly, the level of visibility we have in the second half, and I think the level of uncertainty and the kind of general macroeconomic climate is such that it's the point of data or the point in time, but lots may change. But at least for now, slightly stronger in the first half is the assumption we're making for planning purposes.","Mark Heller - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, I got it. Can I also ask, as -- when we look at sort of etch logic versus -- and foundry versus memory, how is etch dollar content different for Lam versus the 2 different categories?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. I mean, I think from a market share perspective generally in the company, we communicated now for the last several years that we have very good market share across the spenders in the industry and there's one exception to that and the one exception is a big microprocessor company. And so the share of the company and the size of the SAM [ph] with that exception, are kind of reasonably balanced for us. Obviously, the absolute dollars of spending for 10,000 wafer starts in memory comparing to the for foundry or logic is quite different. But putting that aside, the basic opportunity for the company to participate in a dollar of spending with the one exception I referred to is pretty balanced.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess to follow on to the prior question on gross margins. I'm curious how we should think about that as the breadth of customer spending expands and we moved to the $650 million, $750 million range. What kind of gross margin can we assume in that type of environment?","Ernest E. Maddock","C.J., this is Ernie. I think as you see revenues expand into the $750 million range, I'd refer you back to sort of the model results that would put us in a pretty consistent pace with a $3 billion revenue run rate for the year, so you're going to see sort of mid-40s performance at that level.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then I guess to follow on to your comments in terms of your market share goals and the work that you're doing in terms of R&D. I was hoping you could expand a bit on the comments around 14-nanometer double patterning and FinFET? And how we should think about, I guess, the timing there and the magnitude of what that could mean for you guys?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. Obviously, all those are very significant inflection points for the industry. Practically, the first kind of catalyst for any significant spending in our population in the logic arena is the FinFET transition that the big microprocessor company has communicated. They're intending of the 22-nanometer technology node, and that means more for the industry, and fortunately, it does for Lam Research in terms of near-term outlook. But we are making a very concentrated and focused investment in positioning the products of the company at those inflection points. And I think there's some critical decisions that will be made in calendar 2012. But to a very large extent, the revenue opportunities will extend into the '13 or '14 kind of calendar year. So this is really a time to position, and we'll see the revenues when the investment profile occurs, obviously.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Martin, you talked about the etch market and how you guys are positioned and what translates -- when you translate into a lower share in 2011. I was wondering if you can go for that same mix size on wet clean, given that you have gained share. Did you actually grow your record revenue in 2011? And in terms of market exposure, did that hurt you guys?","Martin B. Anstice","We -- I'm going to declined to specifically answer your question about kind of revenues with the product line level because we don't have segment disclosure. But the critical message for us in single-wafer clean is we had good success -- actually very good success without exception defending the positions that we were focused on, and to a very large extent, the penetrations we were pursuing, we were successful in. The big opportunity prospectively that is something we're very focused on is strengthening the competitive offering of the company to address the front-end-of-line opportunities. And that's something that is embedded in the spending communication that we have made for the last several quarters. It's a big focus for the company, and that will be pretty influential in terms of the market share story going forward. My opinion is that I think we're very focused on investments in building that capability and we'll see a fairly kind of mutual 12 months in terms of impact on shipments market share in clean business. And then if we've done the right thing at the right time with customers, we'll be making progress in the following years.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great, very helpful. And then just quickly, there's some chatter about customer -- that DRAM customer that you're consolidating. How do you kind of see that impacting the industry and your business?","Martin B. Anstice","Consolidation obviously, has kind of a couple of consequences to it. One of them is that to the extent, profitability in the semiconductor industry requires it, it's a positive for the equipment industry because it serves no purpose to have semiconductor companies in a state of kind of profitless prosperity, so to speak. And so there's a positive associated with consolidation from that regard. On the other side of that coin, scale in any relationship between a supplier and a customer is always a challenging reality. I would say relative to the specific chatter that you're describing, my opinion is that's a positive for the industry because maybe a bit it creates a competitive dynamic in the semi space that allows the next leg of investment more proactively.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Weston Twigg from Pacific Crest Securities.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if you could give us a little bit better of an idea of how your customers are responding to the Novellus acquisition? And then maybe just moving a step beyond that whether it's related or not, I don't know. But your collaborative relationship with customers and how it relates to some of the technology focus areas you mentioned in 2012?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. So relative to the Novellus acquisition, we've -- I think in the last call, I -- we were communicating that obviously that was the beginning of a process to dialogue with customers in any substance and we spend a lot of time with customers since that time. And I would say the feedback is very positive. We're getting a very good participation by key customers. We're encouraging them actively to communicate their expectations of the combined company. We're encouraging them to participate in sharing their thoughts and ideas in terms of organization and\/or collaboration models. We're encouraging them to articulate their view of strengths and weaknesses of both companies. And I'm very optimistic that as a result of that we will continue to build upon the customer trust momentum that we've established as independent companies over many years. So the basic headline in terms of customer reaction to the announced acquisition is positive. To the second part of your question, which is more directed to the model of collaboration, the most fundamental example of that really speaks to the level of engagement that we have, as an equipment company, with our customers in their R&D environment. And in the last year particularly, our engagements, our collaboration with key customer R&D environments, 2 generations and beyond today's production node is dramatically increased, and that's necessary for a couple of reasons. Their challenges and issues are increasing and the need for a collaboration model is in their interest as much as it is ours. And it's part of obviously, the strategy we have to continue to grow the company and at least as importantly to create the type of dynamics around protecting what we gain going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Martin, maybe first, can you give a little bit of color of what you perceived, etch, as a percentage of total wafer spending in calendar 2012? Obviously '11 was more tilted toward lithography and process control. How do you see etch as a percentage this year?","Martin B. Anstice","We are modeling -- we have 2011 in the 12% to 12.5% range, and we're assuming in the kind of high 13 range for calendar '12.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And is it fair to say that, that's more of the customer mix changing also?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. It's a combination of both the customer and the trade that you set up in your question relative to the lithography investment.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And my follow-up question in terms of 3D devices particularly for the memory guys, how do you see that progressing in your discussions with customers? And do you see the dollar content for etch potentially increasing as the industry -- specifically the memory industry moving to that type of process technology?","Martin B. Anstice","I think there's lots of unanswered questions clearly. I think the one generally accepted example where the 3D structure maybe creates some of relief in terms of lithography investment, which conversely creates a relative expansion of etch share along with other segments, although wafer fab is in NAND flash, where there's a generation or 2 of relaxing of litho rules with the current roadmap in terms of 3D NAND. But to my knowledge, that's the only kind of material rebalancing of spending that exists as a result of the 3D architecture ahead of us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Wonder if, Martin, you could elaborate a little more on your first half outlook in NAND flash. As you called out shipments in NAND decline more than overall than WFE in the second half of last year. So I was just wondering if you're preparing Lam for -- to a NAND CapEx recovery soon or there's higher NAND flash CapEx more of a second half event in your opinion?","Martin B. Anstice","I think in terms of this first half\/second half play, we're -- we've obviously -- we're seeing a significant commitment in the NAND flash area to capacity adds, which is a very different story. The DRAM -- DRAM is not quite exclusively, but almost about upgrade and not capacity addition. Certainly, the visibility we have today would suggest that actually, the flash environment is kind of fairly first half concentrate, actually reasonably balanced. And that's true also in DRAM. I think the upside for the second half of the year is all about consumer confidence. It's all about SSD roadmap. It's all about what happens in ultrabooks. And if the hard disk drive kind of shortages get resolved sooner, then there's potential to see some PC growth above and beyond the assumptions that everybody is meeting today. And I think in the context of comments that Dell made, where they, I think, expressed the fact that only about 40% or so of corporate upgrades, the kind of Windows 7, were accomplished to date, they would appear to be a fairly positive opportunity should that issue get illuminated. So at least for now, we're assuming reasonably equivalent first half\/second half for both segments. I think the second half for DRAM is probably a little stronger than first.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Martin, I wanted to ask a quick question. Your shipment guidance is up quite a bit obviously more than your revenue guidance for the current quarter. Some thoughts there, are your shipping some new products that need to be signed off, new customers, how should we think about that delta?","Martin B. Anstice","That's a really good question, and it's one that I asked couple of hours ago. And the answer to the question is actually if you look at the units of shipments that are leaving the factory, there's quite good linearity. The number of systems that actually leaving in January and February and March are quite flat. But the dollars associated with those things are quite different. And so it really is not a commentary about the time it takes to get acceptance on shipments. It's more just a byproduct of the specific timing of the shipments and the specific value of those shipments. So kind of certainly no fundamental message relative to what's going on in the company.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then last question, the second one is tied to. You gave a lot of puts and takes in your prepared commentary about the outlook. Can you kind -- you were obviously cautious in that. But we are seeing a pretty good acceleration of demand here. So how do we contrast what you're seeing in your guidance and kind of your more cautious commentary?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I think the cautious commentary is intended to reinforce what I think is a very important headline. The macroeconomic environment is very unstable, I mean, we're seeing kind of news every day, the latest being kind of IMF announcements about kind of Eurozone concerns. We saw kind of a positive momentum in terms of employment levels in the U.S. But  best I can tell, we're still at 10.5% or more in the Eurozone and there's lots of unanswered questions. So if that doesn't play out and there's a more positive profile of consumer confidence, then the upside is clearly there and we're certainly managing the company to prepare for either one of those environment.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Martin, you made a comment in response to the question about margins about one of the big customers getting some pricing, I guess in exchange for the big orders. Can you talk a little bit more about that and then maybe that in relation to the idea of a lot of people talking about increasing capital intensity and the business you guys have kind of given us your metrics on that. How much does pricing concessions potentially offset that? And the reason I'm asking is because it looks like semi revenues are going to be up a fair amount this year and wafer fab equipment spending is going to be flat or down. So I just wonder how we can think about capital intensity being up when the most obvious metric of capital intensity would be down?","Martin B. Anstice","That's a very big question. So, to the first part of your question, I didn't actually say we gave pricing for an order. And in fact, one of the reasons we don't give guidance on orders today is because we want to take off the table that dynamic because it serves the shareholder and the customer and the company kind of no value. So our objective is to take orders off the market as soon as they are there. The dynamic that I attempt to communicate is that when a big customer participates very significantly in a proportion of the business of the company as is particularly true in the March quarter this year. This level of concentration is the highest in the last 4 quarters, and we don't see such equivalent concentration in the 4 quarters of calendar '12 today. The specific yields that surround that volume and those configurations in this case happened to drive profitability level in the way it does. I think your question relative to efficiency -- capital efficiency is a legitimate one. I don't think there's any particularly new message in calendar '12 over '11. And we are assuming right now that semi revenue is the kind of $310 million to $315 million range. And we're assuming as I said already, the spending level in terms of wafer fab, flat to slightly down. I think the one really big headline that we've communicated some time and I think it's feature significantly going forward is the cost associated with scale and particularly, in the foundry space and some part of that is associated with scaling in and of itself. Some part of that is associated with the various patterning schemes, but obviously are a component of answering one of the earlier questions today around the balance outstanding etch in wafer fab.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. If I'm allowed to ask a quick follow-up. When I think about the breath of spending this year, we know Samsung is obviously up a tremendous amount. Is there anybody -- I certainly wouldn't ask the customer, but do you expect any other customers to be up year-over-year in wafer fab equipment spending other than the biggest customer?","Martin B. Anstice","I think it's frankly a little too early to answer that question at this time. Frankly, as we all know there are a few very big customers that have a very dominant influence over spending, and they have much interest in not answering the question that you're asking as we do, so it is what it is in the month of January.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Caris & Company.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","You commented that the $30 billion that you expect this year is better than what you're thinking was earlier. Can you provide what number you were thinking about earlier, and also which sectors are better or which ones are worse?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes. We had -- it's the one I said better than previously in our last earnings call. And this was a very preliminary view of 2012 by the time we indicated an expectation of down 5% to down 20% year-over-year, which was at the time in line with the consensus. And so what's changed this since then, I think the most fundamental change has been the demand curve that we're seeing at the 28-nanometer node for the foundry and the positive that you have all been witness to in terms of communications on some MPU spending. And memory specifically, NAND flash has kind of held up nicely with some positive demand curves for NAND-rich content.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up is on the DRAM spending, you gave an outlook for 35% bit growth. DRAM spending would be essentially flat. What would the number -- what kind of DRAM growth would you have to see in order for DRAM spending to start to increase?","Martin B. Anstice","One of the parts to answer that question obviously is at what nodes does the demand occur. And one of the dynamics that existed in calendar '11 continues actually in an increased state in 2012. So our current assumption is that a bit growth of around the 35% to 40% range drives a very small addition of capacity where we can all assume no more than about 20,000 wafer starts and drives a conversion of about 550,000 wafer starts. And that conversion is necessary to a large extent to support the profitability needs of that community of customers. And so I think the headline you should extract is that if there is a bit growth that exceeds 40%,  it has a good shot of being a catalyst for addition of capacity because the assumption today is almost none.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen, Citigroup.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I think in the earlier comments, you alluded to gaining some market share growth at 14-nanometer and at the 2x node. I was wondering whether you see better opportunities for share gain in etch or in clean at 14 and 20.","Martin B. Anstice","So I may have inadvertently confused on an earlier comment. A lot of the 14-nanometer decisions are ahead of us. They have not been made yet, and there's quite a few significant unanswered questions around architecture in our customer base to be made before the selections occur. Relative to the second half, where do I see the opportunity? Clearly in the context of the more kind of longer-term growth plans that we have communicated. And I kind of reinforced those again today, we are speaking to a target of between 3 and 5 percentage points of share gain in etch and 5 to 10 percentage points of  share gain single-wafer clean over 3- to 5-year period. Obviously, in order to kind of put that into context of what that means for earnings, you should obviously reflect the fact that the size of the etch market is meaningfully bigger than clean when you're calculating the dollar opportunity.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then as my follow-up if I can do some top line to their bottom line or their below the line expenses. It seems like an OpEx, when you look at the information you communicated with investors in July, it seems like OpEx has not gone the way perhaps the way you expected in July. Can you comment a little bit about how you might improve this communication on OpEx going forward? And in addition, why your confidence that OpEx -- I think your guiding OpEx to full $195 million. Why are your confident that, that realistic ceiling for us to approach here against that are fall through as we see a -- [indiscernible]?","[Technical Difficulty]","Martin B. Anstice","Okay. Your line was breaking up. I heard the word OpEx and I heard some part of the question, so you're going to have to re-ask if I didn't get it all. So I heard a question about confidence, and I would say the confidence level, given that we're ultimately in control of it is pretty high. So as Ernie and I communicated earlier today, we have just guided operating expense level consistent with we messaged a couple of months ago. And we are in a position today where we believe the expansion can be contained to the $200 million level for the rest of the calendar year based on what we know today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah, Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up on the gross margin question. I guess if you look at the -- some of the announcements so far in CapEx and everyone is sort of talking about the assumption CapEx being up more than 30%. Do you think that customer concentration, this year, would be much higher than, say 2011. So I guess my question is does this customer problem -- customer concentration problem just a one-quarter phenomenon or do you think that this going to be multiple quarters? And I have a follow-up.","Ernest E. Maddock","So Vish, this is Ernie. I think as we indicated in our prepared comments, it is a March quarter circumstance. We would not expect to see this persist in subsequent quarters. So it's a one-quarter phenomenon, as best we know at the present.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then just another follow-up, you mentioned foundries of 50% of your March quarter shipments. Is that just the logic to foundry conversion or is it all foundry?","Martin B. Anstice","It's an accumulation of investments, which trends to the 28-nanometer technology node of that community of customers. And again, I want to make the point that I may already and Ernie made it at the beginning, that definition now includes beyond pure-play foundry. So to the extent, there's a logic guy out there that makes available a significant proportion of its capacity for foundry, it's included in that percentage.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Krish Shankar with Bank of America.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Martin, if you look at the etch market last year, the split between dielectric and conductor etch is roughly 50-50. But it seems like conductor, as a percentage of the values [ph] continued growing relative to dielectric. And in terms of your prepared comments of the 3% to 5% etch share gain, what is the implicit growth for the conductor etch market with this actual share gain or just basing on income, when sort of getting your 3% to 5% share?","Martin B. Anstice","You've asked a very precise question. and I'm not going to give you a very precise answer. In mean, everything is kind of in the mix. There is no question that the transition that you just described and the transition from a dielectric bias weighting to a more balanced or even conductor-heavy at certain point in time, is a benefit to us and that's part of -- that's incorporated in the decisions we make in terms of where we're focused, where we're investing, where we're pursuing penetrations, et cetera. But clearly, we are aggressively pursuing conductor and dielectric market share gain, displacing competition where we believe we can do that. And in addition to the extent, there are new applications and new process flows herein, making sure that we are the guy that's positioned to get that business. So both real displacements and market share gain, effectively defending the positions and the successes of the company in the past, along with taking advantage of this benefit that happens to play with the strength of the company historically, is all a part of that 3% to 5% target that I described.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And if I could just ask a follow-up. On the single-wafer clean side, it looks like some of your competitors have been coming out of this super-high throughput system for single-wafer clean. Arguably, most of them are in the front-end-of-line. But nonetheless, are you worried that the clean market will actually remain ecstatic or even shrink, given that the throughput they're getting like really, really high?","Martin B. Anstice","No. I think it's a good question. It's certainly not something that we are particularly concerned about today. And I made that statement in the context of kind of 2 things. One of them being the point you just made, as systems become higher throughput systems, the challenge for any equipment company is to preserve the value of that offering and ultimately get paid for it. I think the other side of that coin, which is particularly important answering the question in clean is, if you go chat with any semiconductor company in the world, they will, with rare exceptions, talk about the emerging criticality, the increasing criticality of clean as a process step. And so productivity is part of for value proposition, but the technology enabling around, for example, things like high-aspect ratio drying is a big part of what ultimately the customer frames with their equipment selection, but ultimately a big part of positioning by our company for value.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I have 2 follow-ups. Martin, given the new classification of shipment and revenue mix, to what extent do you expect the dollars of shipment opportunity were to exceed the prior peak of, I believe, September of 2010, you had $234 million from Korea. And I'm asking -- let me rephrase the question. To what extent do you think the revenues from Korea are going to exceed $234 million, given the reclassification of your customers?","Martin B. Anstice","I'm not sure I understand that question. Can you...","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, sure. You're reclassifying the foundry mix to include non-pure play. And to that extent, I'm just trying to better understand dollars of opportunity out of Korea since there is a non-pure foundry player there?","Ernest E. Maddock","Mehdi, right. We're sort of crossing a segment with a region, and obviously, if we are precise in answering that question we're revealing something that is not appropriate for us to reveal. So we need a -- I think that history will tell going forward what the improvement in the foundry segment is. And we'll have to wait and let that play out over the course of the year because we're not going to reveal customer specific information.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Sure. And then in terms of, sticking with the revenue mix and given the Novellus acquisition, to what extent are you planning to provide revenue mix by different product groups?","Ernest E. Maddock","Mehdi, we're in the process of reviewing that as we think about the acquisition. We wouldn't expect that Lam's revenue segmentation will change as a result of that. And we're currently in the process of reviewing sort of the practices of Novellus. And as things become further along in the integration and the work, we'll make the determination.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Sure, fair. But would -- don't you think it would be prudent given how there's a different growth opportunities between clean and etch, it would help us better with estimating opportunities by having a better understanding of the mix?","Ernest E. Maddock","But we do actually share with you what the overall market size is for clean and for etch. And we share with you market share and those 2 things together can really essentially provide the information that you're seeking. So I don't know that there's any need to segment differently than we do right now. But we are looking at that. We continue to look at it, and if we feel it's important to change then we'll provide better information than we currently provide, then we'll certainly make that change.","Operator","I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.","Shanye Hudson","I'd like to thank you all for joining us today.

Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Carol Raeburn","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Lam Research quarterly conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today\u2019s call we will share our outlook on the business environment and review our financial results for the June 2014 quarter and our outlook for the September 2014 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 PM this afternoon.

As a reminder a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","With that I will now hand over call over to you Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thank you, Carol and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll start today by commenting on our performance in the June quarter and 2014 fiscal year, then provide a little more color on our view for the outlook for wafer fab equipment spending in the second half of calendar 14 and the full year 2015 before transitioning to Doug. I will conclude with thoughts on Lam growth and describe areas of focus for the company, that should provide you with helpful context.","In the June quarter Lam continued a trend of outperformance and we delivered another quarter of strong execution across the business. Results topped the midpoint of our guided ranges across all metrics, reinforcing our confidence in our recently updated long term financial models.","The June quarter marks the end of our fiscal year, a truly remarkable year for Lam. In a period of transformation within our company and the industry generally we reported record revenues in each successive quarter and operating income that more than doubled year-over-year. We believe that a major theme for Lam in our recent year and more importantly in our future is the opportunity for sustainable out performance.","This is made possible through our position and focus on markets leadership in the segments of WFE that we serve, our critical applications growth strategy targeted to deliver leading edge solutions through significant technology inflections and our demonstrated ability to execute predictably meeting commitments to the full community of stake holders. These strengths all combined to provide a path for Lam to create value of substance for shareholders over the next several years, value creation that should accelerate with continued execution in our markets as they represent expanding proportion of WFE due to the primary technology inflections, most notably in areas related to patenting, 3D devices and advance packaging.","Overall, we estimate that approximately 25% of total WFE investments this year will be directly associated with the inflection technologies and based on the importance of these enabling transitions to our customers and the current pace of pilots and production ramps we maintain our view of WFE spending within a $32 billion range.","For our company due to the complement of our strengths with the spending bias of our customers we continue to remain optimistic that the second half of calendar 2014 can achieve a revenue level reasonably similar to the first half of the year. Although much can change at this time it would be fair to characterize that we expect December to be stronger than September.","Now to the segment details, starting with NAND flash memory we continue to see balance between supply and demand of bits as sustainable profitability continues to be a strong customer focus. We believe that customers are supplementing and converting capacity in a very rational manner with WFE spending relatively consistent with earlier expectations. Investment is focused on 16-nanometer and below planar conversions as well as initial 3D NAND capacity. As noted at our investor and analyst event recently we continue to expect planar investments to represent the major of NAND\u2019s WFE spending this year, representing approximately two-thirds of the total. Our outlook for 2014 NAND supply bit growth remains in the lower 40% range.","In DRAM we saw continued strength and investments in the June quarter. Strong DRAM ASP with a supply constrained market are underpinning an industry focus on realizing healthy returns on investments made. Accordingly investments are primarily being made to enable the transition to mid 2x and below technology nodes, transitions which we believe offer meaningful value to customers from a very efficient upgrade oriented spending. Projections for DRAM bit growth are approximately 30% this year. Overall in memory we maintain our projection for 2014 WFE at $12 billion to $13 billion.","Lastly in both the foundry and broader logic segments our outlook remains more or less consistent with the prior view. The ramp plans for 20 nanometer foundry and 14 nanometer logic appear from our perspective to be progressing largely as expected with a foundry focus on 20 nanometer investments in the first half of the year and the second half of the year weighted to early FinFET purchases and a broadening of participants. Restating my earlier message we expect WFE at the $32 billion level in calendar year \u201814 and revenues at Lam to materially outperform to that baseline year-over-year comparison.","For 2015, we continue to believe that WFE spending levels are biased to be stronger than \u201814 with key opportunity and risk being defined by success of latest generation devices, utilizing new enabling technology measured by performance and cost benefits in their markets and the conviction of participants to grow profitably in an increasingly consolidated and competitive semiconductor industry.","For Lam we believe that the share of WFE that would be attributed to markets that we serve will increase as technology inflections become more mainstream and represent perhaps approximately one-third of total spending next year by our customers. Combined with this sound growth outperformance, we believe our technology inflections applications market share is in excess of 50% across the portfolio of deposition edge and clean products.","We remain excited by this unique opportunity and work hard each day to make our commit \u2013 to meet our commitments and continuously strengthen the trust that our customer place in our company and the individuals who work here. This commitment, out performance and execution is evidenced in our reported 90% success rate in targeted penetration and defense activities in the first half of calendar \u201814. This is one of the most fundamental measures of the trust in Lam and the quality of our people, our product and technology roadmap and our ability to execute.","Our momentum, particularly in the most challenging critical applications is enabled by our commitment to invest in the inflections for the long term and emphasis on customer collaboration in pursuit of solutions to their most critical challenges. Execution in these areas is underpinned by the fact that we have shipped 17 new product configurations in the last 12 months, marking perhaps the most active period of innovation in our company, in a company that has long prided itself on its innovation at the leading edge.","Our focus areas are on the critical path for our customers and this shared value proposition is providing significant growth opportunities for Lam. Illustratively our leadership in the patenting area is aligned with customers\u2019 need for scaling solutions in advance of next generation Litho, our leadership in back end of line clean is aligned with customers critical yield initiatives. As we discussed in some detail recently we are also focused on expanding our engagement with customers related to their installed based partnering to achieve the level of performance they need to be successful over the long term.","An opportunity exists for Lam to differentiate itself through comprehensive and configurable lifecycle solutions, partnering with our customer to innovate through the economic challenges of scaling. That is a key focus for our customer service business group. The capability to rapidly address customer challenges with innovative and cost effective solutions, combined with increasing level of support we are receiving from customers globally is fundamental to executing our vision. Neither the outperformance we have delivered to-date nor the opportunities presented here would be possible without successful collaborations with our customers and partners more broadly through the industry. We thank them all sincerely and are delighted by the recognition we have received for our efforts.","As we shared a couple of weeks ago, the next six months are a very busy period for us at the customer interface, supporting them with critical ramps and focusing on the significant number of equipment selection decisions outstanding for this year, staying aligned with our customer on their needs, planning and executing accordingly.","As you might expect, for a company that is targeted to grow between 20% and 25% year-over-year in calendar \u201814, in turn creating approximately $1 billion of cash from operations, for a company with a vision to grow meaningfully, through a multi-year technology inflection period, Lam leadership is committed to successful scaling of our company in a manner that is transparent and value creating for our customers and shareholders.","In conclusion and notwithstanding the formidable strength of our competitors we continue to believe we are well positioned to outperform in the coming years. We plan to execute to win key applications and with a $2 billion SAM expansion opportunity through calendar 2017 we are very excited about a future of growth.","Last but not least I would like to recognize the Lam, the full complement of 6,700 employees globally who worked tirelessly through a complex and transformative period for the company, who believed in the opportunity and prioritized their role modeling, our values of customer first, company and then individual and achieving our vision objective of being number one in customer trust above all else. Many thanks to everybody.","With that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Doug.","Douglas Bettinger","Okay, thanks Martin. Good afternoon everyone. And I want to thank you today for joining us during what I know is a busy earnings season for your guys. Let me just begin by saying we are very pleased with the results from our June quarter which topped off very strong performance for fiscal year 2014.","Operating income continued to outpace revenue growth, growing at roughly twice the rate both in the quarter as well as in the year. Gross margin and earnings per share both came in above the midpoint of our guidance demonstrating the strength of our business model. We continue to execute on our plans to outperform the industry around the key technology inflections as well as to deliver on our financial commitments.","Shipments in the June quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.160 billion, which was down about a $100 million sequentially but up slightly when you compare to the December quarter. The memory segment represented 59% of total system shipments and that was down from 66% in the March quarter. Within that NAND shipment contributed approximately 20% of total system shipments and I\u2019ll just point we still anticipated the planar NAND node conversions will represent the majority of NAND investments for the full year and we do expect to see an increase in planar investments in the back half of the calendar year.","DRAM shipments were strong at 39% of system shipments. That was up from 3% in March quarter. With healthy pricing in the DRAM market and supply remaining tight relative to demand we have seen an increase in spending to support both 25 nanometer and 20 nanometer node conversions. Our successfully product positions from multi patterning applications continue to be a tailwind with respect to the DRAM segment.","Foundry shipments were 30% of total system shipments and this was up from 28% in the prior quarter. We expect to see a strengthening in foundry investment in the second half of the calendar year with a broadening of the customer base investing in FinFET pilot production as well as additional investment in the 28 and 20 nanometer nodes.","And finally logic and other shipments comprised 11% of total system shipments and this was up from 6% in the March quarter. Revenue for the June quarter came in at $1.249 billion setting a new high for the fifth consecutive quarter. June gross margin percentage came in at 46.4%, an increase of about 90 basis points compared to the March quarter.","And as we shared with you in the past business volumes and overall business mix contribute to the variability in our gross margin performance and we expect to see fluctuation in gross margins on a quarterly basis. Our operating expenses were within our expectations for the June quarter at $322 million holding steady at about 26% of revenue. We continue to prudently manage SG&A cost to allow us to appropriately fund strategic development programs that are expected to generate growth in future revenues.","Our R&D spending is focused at the leading edge technology nodes as well as the technology inflections that you heard us talk about during our investor meeting earlier this month. We are spending on products and etching our position that will move us further into atomic scale processing.","We are spending on products in clean to deliver next generation yield solutions for our customers. Operating income delivered in the June quarter was $258 million and this was up about $10 million from the March quarter. Our operating margin came in at 20.6% above the midpoint of our guidance range, reflecting the leverage in our model.","The tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 15% .I do expect this rate to raise somewhat as we move into our 2015 fiscal year. I would be modeling a rate in the high-teens for the near future. This increase is driven by a more significant amount of our revenue being generated domestically where tax rates are a little bit higher. I should point out to you that this tax rate estimate does not include any benefit from the potential extension of the R&D tax credit in the United States. If that tax credit is extended it would lower our rate by two to three percentage points.","The resulting earnings per share for the quarter came in at $1.25 and that was above the midpoint of our guidance range. The majority of the upside is attributable to our improved gross margin for the quarter. Our earnings per share were based on a share count of roughly 173 million shares. The share count includes the dilutive effect of 8.2 million shares from the 2041 convertible note. And I\u2019ll just remind you that the dilution schedules for this note as well as now the 2016 and 2018 notes are posted on our investor relations website to help you with your modeling. As our share price has ticked up in the last quarter modeling the dilutive impact from our converts now requires looking at all three of the notes.","Cash from operations was robust at $246 million, generated in June quarter and this was about 20% of revenue. Cash from operations benefited from continued focus on working capital metrics. Day sales outstanding improved in June to 58 days and that compared to 61 days in the March quarter. Inventory turns did decline slightly as we added a little bit of inventory for future business growth.","Now let me turn to balance sheet. We ended the quarter with gross cash and short term investments which include our restricted cash of $3.2 billion. This was up 11% from $2.9 billion in the March quarter. Cash in the quarter was bolstered by $135 million from the sale of some non-essential real estate assets. We had deferred revenue of $362 million which does not include $34 million in shipments to Japanese customers which will convert to revenue in future quarters.","And I\u2019ll just remind you on April 29th we announced that the Board of Directors approved a $1 billion capital return program which consists of an $850 million share repurchase authorization along with the first quarterly dividend in the 34 year history of the company. During the June quarter we spend $36 million on the repurchase of approximately 624,000 shares at an average price of $56.89. We expect to complete the balance of the share repurchases over the next two years. The quarterly dividend was initiated at $0.18 which was paid out on July 2nd. The scope of the capital return program demonstrates the confidence we and the Board of Directors have in the cash generation capability of this company.","Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We expect shipments to come in at $1.110 billion plus or minus a range of $50 million. We expect revenue of $1.150 billion again plus or minus $50 million. Shipments and revenue reflect a sequential decrease in total memory spending offset by a growth in foundry spending. We expect gross margin to come in at 45.5% plus or minus one percentage point. We are forecasting operating margins of 17.5% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally we forecast earnings per share of $0.92 plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 177 million shares.","And I\u2019d just like to pause for a moment and point out to you that within the midpoint of this EPS guidance is the impact of roughly $0.05 from the incremental dilution from the converts as well the increase in tax rate. Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll go first to C. J. Muse with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","C. J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, in terms of the implied guide for second half revenues consistent with the first half, it looks like you\u2019re looking at revenues growing roughly 15% sequentially into the December quarter. And I guess the question there is one, can you talk about visibility? And then two, how much of that will be an increase in shipments versus a drive down of deferred revenues?","Douglas Bettinger","Well, I think the first to thing to say is the visibility for something six months away isn\u2019t as good as the visibility three months away, but we certainly, we do our best C.J. to kind give you an appropriate linkage between commentary from the customers and the opportunity for the company. I will remind you that I said approximately similar, not precisely the same. So first half, second half side, I\u2019d be sensitive to being a little too precise in the calculation here but for all intents and purposes we believe we got a revenue expansion, revenue opportunity and expansion between September and December that will be approximately equal first half and second half.","We don\u2019t typically disclose our backlog and orders in a conversation like this. Obviously we have to file a 10-K and there will be a backlog number in there. But I will comment the backlog for the company, the difference between the orders received from customers and shipments made to customers has built by more than $200 million in the last two quarters. So we\u2019re kind of building backlog. And frankly speaking the relationship between shipments and revenues is reasonably consistent from one period to another. So in answer to the second part of your question, is it a draw down, it would only ever be draw down if the circumstances of the customer were causing us to respond to their request that way but there isn\u2019t a fundamental message on shift in revenue turns that would kind of undermine the outlook that we\u2019ve shared with you.","C. J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group","That\u2019s very helpful. And then Doug if I could ask you a quick question here. In terms of greater tax generated here in the U.S. how does that change your thinking in terms of perhaps being more aggressive on buybacks and\/or upside to that $850 million?","Douglas Bettinger","It doesn\u2019t really. The two are not related in my mind, C.J. I mean we announced a capital return program before I really modeled what I expected the tax rate for the next fiscal year to be. So in my mind it\u2019s not inter-related. And again the uptick just to clarify in the tax rate has a lot to do with the fact that we are shipping more systems into the U.S. which has higher tax rate than when we ship them elsewhere. But the two things are independent in my C.J.","C. J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, thank you.","Douglas Bettinger","Thanks C.J.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks a lot. Just Doug a question on calendar Q4. I know that you don\u2019t want to talk too much about it but if you just look at your guidance to grow the revenue between 20% and 25% for the year and you take the midpoint, certainly it suggests that the revenue in December is going to be a little bit better than what it was in June. And I am wondering from a gross margin perspective is there anything abnormal in the shipment concentration and what\u2019s likely to ship in December that would make gross margin or the profile any different because that would argue that your gross margin should be better in December than it was in June Thanks.","Douglas Bettinger","You know Tim, I am not going to answer that question. We\u2019re not going to get into giving hard guidance more than one quarter out. I think you\u2019re thinking on the topline is probably directionally right. I haven\u2019t quite gone through where all of the mix would fall out. I would kind of take you back though to the financial model that we out as the best guide post for how I would be thinking about the profitability and the gross margin of the company, Tim.","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, great, Doug. Thanks. And then Martin can you talk a little bit about are there concrete examples? I know you probably don\u2019t want to get too much into the specifics but are there examples, when you talk your customers that you have gained share or you\u2019ve gain a slot as a result of the ongoing proposed merger that\u2019s happening out there with your larger peers. Are there any examples of you absolutely gaining share as a result of that merger? Thanks.","Martin Anstice","There is a lot of evidence that we\u2019re gaining share. Whether it\u2019s precisely a byproduct of the customer\u2019s reaction to a planned merger or not is a conversation I don\u2019t waste my time having with a customer honestly. So I am sure that the value proposition, to the extent the customers are not positive and you will need to talk to customers directly to figure out whether they are or are not. But to the extent that they are not positive about that time \u2013 my personal opinion is that the benefit is more a kind of medium and long term benefit to the company, not short-term.","So the simple reason that it takes a long time to make changes to market share of this company and when you get selected or you\u2019re working on a selection they tend to stick pretty well. So I am sure there is an example or two along the way where we might be able to claim that was because of reaction but frankly speaking I think it\u2019s not a conversation that we tend to have. We just focus on delivering the best solution that we can and focusing on established differentiation in the critical application space and we try to articulate that in our forward-looking targets and we try to articulate it at the most recent analyst call by reminding everybody that in the patterning space we\u2019re addressing two-thirds of all the multi-patterning critical steps. And in the 3D NAND conversion we have 90% position on the critical applications across all memory customers and more than 60% on all applications.","So gaining share and growing our company is all about critical applications focus and inflections. And if along the way, whether it\u2019s associated with the reaction to a competitor\u2019s merger plan or not, if we gain other business by building customer trust, than we are excited about that opportunity as well.","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks very much.","Martin Anstice","Thanks.","Douglas Bettinger","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Our next question will come from John [Fitzer] with Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess Martin my first question just relates to some incremental news on EUB that was out in the market today, that clearly impacted, I think your stock and some of peers\u2019 stock. I am kind of curious from your perspective if the timing of EUB in your mind has changed all that much. I know you addressed this at Analyst Day but I will be curious again to get a better understanding from your perspective if EUB gets inserted quicker than we think what that might do to that $2 billion TAM opportunity that you\u2019ve talked about?","Martin Anstice","Hi, very, very simply my view of the intercept point on the EUB is no different today than it was the last time we were in public domain. And relative to the impact of EUB insertions to the 2017 $2 billion SAM expansion, little or nothing of impact. And that\u2019s just a commentary that I would extract from the statements of our customers. Our customers have almost without exception stated no intercept to 10 nanometers in logic and maybe there is a back haul opportunity but it\u2019s one or two levels, one or two passes. So I think fundamentally no change in view of intercept and no impact of substance to the $2 billion SAM expansion we articulated.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s helpful. Then maybe as my follow up, I know you talked about directionally WFE being up in calendar year \u201815. I am wondering if you could attempt to qualify that or at least if not quantify, kind of qualify the puts and takes within the broader buckets of NAND, DRAM and FinFET. And I guess I\u2019m particularly interested in FinFET because the sense I get is this time last year looking a year out the visibility on 20 nanometers seemed to be a lot more tangible than the visibility on 1614 is for the next 12 months, maybe you can address that, that will be helpful.","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I am going to resist the temptation to respond quantitatively, it feels too early to do that but as I said in the analyst meet I think there is two or three levels to the conclusion on [BIAS 2] growth next year \u2013 statement of capital intensity. I think in each of these transitions whether it\u2019s kind of patterning, the incremental patterning steps that we articulated or in logic and DRAM whether it\u2019s the incremental SAM expansion that exist in the NAND flash. And even in litho I believe there is an opinion that there is capital intensity increased in a planar to 3D transition. So capital intensity I think is part of the story.","I think the general commentary on demand for electronics consumer and enterprise and IC units, if you kind of begin with a GDP commentary is a little bit more positive in \u201815 than it is in \u201814. I think the competitive dynamic that exist in a consolidated semiconductor world tends to deliver two things to us. It tends to deliver discipline in spending and it creates very high risk reward opportunities for growth for our customers. And so I think there is a tremendous amount of conviction associated with establishing market share leadership positions through these technology inflections and clearly calendar \u201815 is the first year of substance when we are going from private line investments into an HVM regime. So I kind of \u2013 I look at the sum of all of the data points that are available to us and none of them seemed particularly negative if negative at all and we will kind of part [inaudible] and maybe by the time we get to the October earnings call put a number out to you but I would say at this point, we expect WFE to be stronger and we expect our share of that expansion to be a positive story as well, remember our view of proportion of WFE that inflection related goes from that 25% in calendar 14 to approximately one-third in calendar 15.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks guys.","Martin Anstice","Thanks John.","Operator","And our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good afternoon. Nice job on the quarterly execution. At your analyst day you mentioned inflexion technology spend of about third of WFE spend next year versus 25% this year. Looking at at a lot more granular level, it seems like you still expect 3D NAND to kind of exit this year at about kind of 6-7% of total installed NAND capacity. Can you just give us some numbers on why you expect 20 nanometer DRAM mix to be in terms of the installed capacity exiting this year and what I am trying to get out is or get a sense for, what is the upgrade tail wind as we look into 2015?","Douglas Bettinger","When you say 29 nanometer, did you say 20 nanometer DRAM or 20 nanometer (inaudible).","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan","20 Nanometer DRAM.","Martin Anstice","Well I think the opportunity for kind of sustainable upgrade is pretty significant. I mean our estimate for the end of calendar \u201814 is that there is probably 450,000 wafer starts per month capacity at 3X or above which is a pretty significant number and our estimates on the 2X proportion by the end of calendar year is still a pretty low number. So I think conversion opportunity down to 20 nanometer is going to be a significant part of the story for a calendar 15 and even more so for the company because of the transitions in terms of double patenting. I will remind you that there three to four steps of multi-patterning in a mid 2X technology node, there are 15 to 20 steps of multi patenting at 20 nanometer and 30 to 40 steps at 1X. And as David Hemker, our CTO explains in the analyst meeting there are multiple process for each one of those steps.","So I think the story in terms of sustainable investment through upgrades is going to have a very prominent theme for WFE next year and I think it will be even stronger for the company for the reasons that I just stated.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan","Yeah. Makes a lot of sense and then Martin within our balance first half, second half shipping outlook, last quarter you had anticipated about in and out of the spenders in the second half, looking at our shipment guide for September and kind of the pipeline for the second half of the year, is it unfolding this way, I know you mentioned a broader base of spenders in logic and foundry. Are you also seeing a broader set of customers spending in memory as well here in the second half?","Douglas Bettinger","Yeah, Harlan, this is Doug, I will take that one. The memory cap spending it\u2019s the same guys. In memory, when we look first half, second half is maybe a little bit first half weighted. Conversely is foundry logic is a little bit second half weighted and broadening out that we described to you a quarter ago we\u2019re absolutely still expecting to see \u2013 you are seeing a broadening out of people spending out in FinFET, we are seeing some investment at 28 and 20 nanometer as well and it\u2019s more substantial in terms of the number of people spending in the second half than the first.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan","Got it. Okay thank you very much.","Douglas Bettinger","Yeah, you are welcome, Harlan thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks so much for taking the question, I appreciate it. Martin I hate to go back to kind of the noise of the day, but I think it was important as John Fitzer suggested relative to some of the stocks. Could you offer us your perspective just from a technical standpoint on if indeed the wafers that IBM was talking about processing were processed without any photo resist on them, what exactly that would mean in terms of what kind of test that would be from an industry perspective and a technical perspective?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I don\u2019t think, I mean I can kind of give you some fairly superficial commentary. We are not the experts here, we are not qualified and we don\u2019t know enough about what they stated. I mean I read a bunch of reports.","James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I promise you, you know more than I do.","Martin Anstice","That may be true but the basic headline for the company is the multiple patterning opportunities of growth for us are fundamental. They are real and they are not likely impacted in the 2017 timeframe by any EUB conversation. There is a tremendous amount of learning still ahead of the industry, relative to EUB, very clear and every year that passes, that builds an installed base of alternatives, in terms of etch and depositions systems for spacer based DRAM multiple patterning or emergent litho and X systems in logic, every year that passes, the bigger the installed base is, the motivation for reuse is very significant. And so the economic tradeoff on the intercept actually is even more challenging, not less challenging as every year passes.","So I don\u2019t know the people are really processing that but clearly the long term benefit for the customer if the productivity performance that is being described by SML is achieved in a production environments is a good thing for the industry in sustaining Morse law. But in the meantime, we got a lot of things to focus on and certainly in the 2017 timeline I don\u2019t think there is much of anything to talk about today.","James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Helpful thank you. As a follow-up you and a lot of folks have talked a lot about the broadening out of a foundry spend and the second tier foundry customers starting to spend a little bit more money. Can you walk us through a little bit of differences in timing on when you may see orders and deliver shipments of some of the second tier foundries versus some of the other peers in the industry and how that could impact you know have one and growth and even how that might affect your visibility into the early part of 2015 shipments to the extent that maybe some of those orders are coming for you in the back half of 2014 whereas some of them whereas some of those orders from the second tier foundries might have come to some of your peers in the earlier part of 2014.","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I mean not to be semantic but I mean to the best of my knowledge there aren\u2019t so many equipment companies with a big back log today. So, it\u2019s much less about an orders conversation and it\u2019s much more about the quality of conversation and the demonstrative performance of the customer in that conversation to plan and commitments communicated to us. And there is an expectation in our first half and second half that as Doug said, the foundry business and the proportionate shipments in foundry have a meaningful increase and relative to concentration you know just take a kind of quick look at numbers, there is not a customer in that population that\u2019s outside of the biggest guy in that list is 30%-40% of our shipments.","So it\u2019s a fairly diverse participation level and it\u2019s happening at a time when there is a very unique and very critical opportunity to establish market share leadership in a FinFET device marketplace. And so when I think through kind of risk as I said multiple times this year, I think the risk profile for calendar \u201814 is actually pretty low. I mean there is always some adjustment a little bit here or there but that\u2019s in the scheme of things there is noise, where things get a little bit more unpredictable is being able to articulate a view on transitions out of privates line to HPM. I mean headline is there are only so many customers today for the equipment industry, there are only so many semiconductor company spending money adding leading edge capacity and it is critically important that they validate their capability to do that.","So that when someone is in the marketplace whether there is going to be a follower or a leader with a competitive device in terms of performance of cost, they can move quickly. And so I actually don\u2019t feel like there is tremendous amount of exposure to the commentary of the company in the second half of the year. I might be wrong but that\u2019s how I feel. I feel like calendar \u201815 is much more challenging to predict.","James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Very helpful. Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Jim.","Operator","And our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hi thank you taking my question. First one Martin just wondering if you could take a \u2013 you highlighted how a third of WFE next year would go the inflection, if you were to take a slag which should be the biggest bucket of spending among that will it be FinFET, 3D NAND or multi patterning DRAM?","Martin Anstice","Well, wow I thought you were going to ask me a slight different so \u2013 I next year I mean I have got an answer for the question for the three year yeah, I don\u2019t I am going to rather take a kind of flyer I am going to kind of hold off. I mean clearly in the $2 billion context we have said that the foundry logic transition which is a mixture of patenting in the FinFET device of the single largest portion for us. Next is NAND Flash 3D NAND and the third in this is multi-patterning DRAM. And the fourth is advanced packaging. I guess it\u2019s a reasonable commentary from I just said to conclude that the foundry implications in 3D NAND are greater than DRAM next year but for our company we clearly have very strong participation in DRAM as well.","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then question for Doug if I look at the margin structure, are there any other level for improving the margin or even to be floating around the mid-40\u2019s gross margin and maybe mid the 20\u2019s margin is it purely a function of revenue from here or do you have other levers to improve the margin?","Martin Anstice","The thing I understand Chris when you are running a company the scale and scope of Lam Research you got to be driving cost reduction everyday every year you have to be making sure your efficiencies and things like that in the manufacturing and supply chain are being pushed as far as they can be pushed. We got do it year-over-year and we are absolutely doing that this year as hard as we did last year and we will do it just as hard next year, because we have expectations from our customers that they are going to get some pricing reduction. You got to at least drive cost as fast as just mostly in place.","Douglas Bettinger","I think I would then take you to Chris is go back to the financial models that we just put out at the beginning of this month. That\u2019s the way you should be thinking about the profitability level of the company we put in the \u201814-\u201915 model gross margin at 45 going over the next three to four years to 46 and approaching 47. That\u2019s a way you should be thinking about things and there will be puts and takes quarter by quarter around those numbers but we constructed those models and tried to be very thoughtful about how the portfolio of the business was going to look.","Martin Anstice","And just to add to that, if you don\u2019t do what Doug say if you don\u2019t just float you drown. So it is correctly important to focus on the totality of the thing that influence the gross margin and the operating expenses of the company and we have two levels simply stated in gross margin, one of them is cost and one of them is revenue and the pricing consequences are all byproduct of a competitive environment and differentiation, which is why we make such an investment to position the product and technology portfolio to be as strong as it can be it and it can always be stronger, but it can [in some] differentiation. And the last thing that we think about when we position profitability in our long-term model is what we think is a fair distribution of profits over the supply chain and what do we think is defendable sustainable position to take with customers.","As best I can tell economics still represents a significant component of risk relative to Moore\u2019s law in just physics and if you get that long-term positioning wrong you create a customer trust exposure which in my opinion is really high. So we try to position profitability levels in ways that we feel comfortable, just defining at customer interface. And in that context we believe we\u2019re positioned for best customer trust and ultimately best partnership, best collaboration and if we execute in the way that we intend to ultimately out performance of revenues and profits as well.","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thank you. It\u2019s very helpful, thanks Martin and Doug.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Krish.","Operator","Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura","Thanks, great job on gross margin. Doug I noticed the incremental gross margin in the quarter was extremely high. It was roughly 100%. Was there anything one time worth highlighting here in the June period?","Douglas Bettinger","No, there was nothing one time. I mean as I tried to describe the impact of different kinds of mix characterizations, different customer mixes, different tool mixes, not everything here has the same profitability. We benefited from pretty favorable mix last quarter and it\u2019s kind of coming back to where it was in the previous quarter in our current guidance.","Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura","Okay and then how are you thinking about the share count going forward with the authorization you have in place?","Douglas Bettinger","With the $850 buyback authorization we are only just starting on it. We are going to execute that buyback over approximately the next two years and you should assume we will consistently be in the market buying that back. What\u2019s moving against us a little bit right now is the dilution from those convertible notes and even though we were in the market last quarter share counts ticking up and it\u2019s really all about what happening from an increasing share price and the impact on those converts. So we will continue to be aggressive with the buyback. What I can\u2019t control is kind of the note dilution right.","Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura","Thanks Doug.","Douglas Bettinger","Yeah, thanks Romit.","Operator","We will take the next question from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the foundry spending in the second-half. If we can make an attempt at 25 the broadness of the foundry putting in two buckets, 28 nanometer and higher and 20 nanometer lower, can you break down your expectation for the second half in those two buckets.","Martin Anstice","Yeah, more of it is at the leading edge Mahesh. The 20 nanometer in the FinFET investment is more substantial than 28 by a decent amount.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and the second on, I think on the memory, memory has been very strong this year and your first-half is about 55% on average. We have seen a wild fluctuation in memory investment in last three years. Now with the increased capital density will you be able to make a guess at how do you see a normalized percent spending of memory going forward like is it 40% you expect or 50% or 30% in that range? Just a very high ball park number, that will be helpful.","Douglas Bettinger","I wish I can help but we are not going to. Frankly you it is getting for those folks who have conversations about memory or cycles again it\u2019s really hard to do that because I don\u2019t know how to do that anymore, right. What I can see is a community of ten customers or 15 that each have their own cycles, that are spending consistent with their windows of opportunity and they are being very disciplined and very effective in terms of operating and the pace at which they add capacity, keeping supply and demand in balance. When I think about extendibility and sustainability of spending I focus on profitability levels of customers and as best I can tell in memory today that\u2019s pretty good. And I focus on the proportion of capacity that is still available for upgrade to known near term technology road map transitions.","And as I already said in the DRAM world we exit this year even with a significant level of spending but probably 450,000 wafer starts per month of capacity at 3x or above and in the NAND flash world we probably exit his year with maybe 500,000 wafer starts per month of capacity at 20 nanometer or above. So there are known upgrade pause of near-term significance and those are both opportunities that on their own represent the same type of spending level that exists in calendar \u201814. That\u2019s how I think though sustainability. I don\u2019t spend much time trying to correlate the spending of customer this year which is intended to support revenues next year and beyond with the revenues of this year, I have never understood that.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Douglas Bettinger","Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Mahesh.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So I have a question regarding your comment I heard that you talk about logic be more back half this year I was wondering is that to do with more to do with your share gain in the logic space or is it the customer is not ramping investment. I am just trying to get some color on that.","Douglas Bettinger","Yeah, I mean my comment was around our shipments being a little more back end back half loaded. I think WFE and this kind of eye balling it here right now is maybe a little bit back half loaded. It\u2019s not significant headwind but it is a little second-half weighted and memory conversely is little bit front weighted.","Martin Anstice","So we have an assumption that in about a $13 billion foundry WFE is the first-half at six and the second-half at seven.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company","Just to clarify it on the logical foundry or both there is \u2013 I thought you mentioned in logics specially, just give me a little bit update?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, that was foundry and in the world of microprocessor and other logic we are to Doug\u2019s points reasonably balanced.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company","I see, okay, great, thanks for clarifying that. And then any further update you can provide on the Clean products I understand you have it in the marketplace now and you probably start to get customer data on that any update on that when you expect [inaudible] share of the product and how do we start to think about that as potentially a growth driver for you guys.","Martin Anstice","Yeah, the first update is we still have one. The second update is we have really nice engagement with the three customers we have talked about I think we have been very pleased with the kind of validation, the productivity, the reliability of these systems some really can performance in fact I would say we saw that up and the performance we had in start-ups has surpassed expectations frankly for products of this maturity. So that\u2019s really good. The process learning is kind of the focus of the company in the second-half of the year and that\u2019s why everything comes together because now are delivering results from a wafer and you are yield, validated yield improvements for the customer. So that\u2019s kind of a critical phase and we have kind of pulled from two further customers and I believe we are scheduled for shipments in the September quarter for the second too who will receive the early our next generation clean system.","So I feel as good as we could at this point but I would kind of register that obviously there is a significant amount of process learning ahead of us and as far as modeling is concerned, I\u2019ll remind you that although in percentage terms the clean market share growth plans are the largest in the company. They are the 5% to 10% clean market share over the timeline 316 and 317. There also the market share growth plans which are most hockey stick. So in your modeling please don\u2019t linearize the growth of the company in clean.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company","Great. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.","Patrick Ho \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thank you very much. Martin, in one of your comments and I think to one another question, you talked about how unpredictable it is to get the timing of pilot to high-volume manufacturing. Maybe as it relates to 3D NAND, as you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing more planar conversions in the second half of the year. How fungible, how balance can you be if the customers decide to accelerate 3D NAND versus doing planar conversion how do you react to any of those type of changes?","Martin Anstice","Well, as we articulated there is \u2013 I mean we have a great participation in both of them but we have higher share in 3D NAND than we do Planar and we have a significantly greater SAM in 3D than we do in Planar as well.","So, I mean the consequence of acceleration of 3D NAND is we got a lot more output leaving factories which means we need to be proactive, ensuring we got capacity in factories to build things. We got capacity in supply chain to buy things and we got capacity in the field service organization to install systems.","So because of the uncertainty we end up kind of running a level of kind risk management and has some level of cost in the company we try to keep it manageable but there is a cost to uncertainty. And what we clearly got to do is be able to execute because we put a lot of time, effort and money into creating the opportunity to outperform and so we got to be resource sufficiently to execute it.","As best I can tell, in every, every one of the four NAND flash today has invested in some level of planar scaling and also 3D NAND expansion and every one of them has some fairly specific plans of substance emerging in the back half of this year and obviously calendar \u201815. And I do expect the calendar \u201815 is obviously a big year for demonstrated performance and cost benefits of the 3D device.","Patrick Ho \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Great, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe a question for Doug. In terms of the services opportunity that you talked about at the Analyst Day. What are some of levers for both the cost of goods line as well as on OpEx line as it relates to services business that will help you keep the corporate margins where they are or at least at their targeted model?","Douglas Bettinger","Patrick we had \u2013 really the slide that I had, I am sure that showed out performance in terms of top line growth from that services business. I mean that success there is comprehended in that model. So \u2013 and I think you know typically the gross margin a little bit lower in that business but the operating income is actually quite good. So the success of that part of business is comprehended in those financials models that we \u2013","Martin Anstice","So I\u2019ll add one thing and that is a commentary on mix. So and this is kind of where the rubber meets the road in terms of economy of the company. If our focus is on percentage of profitability than selling more upgrades to customers is the right answer because the upgrades business of the company is very highly profitable business for the company in relative terms.","But the downside of that is it\u2019s a much lower door than on original equipment sales. So, we try to focus on the long term financial performance which means doing what is right for the customer in the long term is the guiding principle. So, we\u2019re not going to \u2013 flow between new system sales and upgrades on a win trying to manage percentage versus dollars. We\u2019re going to do the right thing for the customer relative to straight off. That\u2019s an important lever but one that responds to the needs of the customers more than it does a particular orientation of the company.","Carol Raeburn","Operator we have time for one more call.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from Sandip [inaudible] with Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the call. As we think about a potentially large migration of end customer business from one big foundry to another next year what level of capacity build do you expect to see over the next 12 to 18 months and what portion of it would be new greenfield capacity versus upgrades to existing capacity particularly in 14 nanometer FinFET? And as follow up to that, given the competition in foundry has increased dramatically do you think there is a chance of an overbuild of foundry capacity near term?","Martin Anstice","I am going to start with the back end of your question first. I think there is tremendous discipline and I don\u2019t think there is a material risk of over capacity. And my frame of reference to that is that\u2019s 28 nanometer technology nodes there is probably 350,000 waters starts of installed capacity. And even with the competitive environment that you just described I believe that by the end of this year the sum of the 28 nanometer Planar and first generation FinFET 1614 is going to be in the range of 120,000 to 140,000 water starts capacity. So it\u2019s doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s anywhere close to a high kind of risk profile.","In answer to your question how much capacity to get there, that\u2019s a little hard to tell but frankly speaking most of the last three years have seen capacity editions in one node or another at foundries all around about 100,000 water start per month level. And certainly I would expect that to be directionally relevant for calendar \u201815 maybe a little stronger. And as we mentioned many times because of the multi patterning effects of the company and the positioning in terms of share we shared some out performance potential in that context.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Sandip.","Carol Raeburn","That concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining us. A webcast of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website this afternoon. That concludes our comment. Good bye.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Miss. Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.","Tina Correia","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Martin Anstice, Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today\u2019s call, we will share our outlook on the business environment and review our financial results for the September 2018 quarter and our outlook for the December 2018 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1\u2019o clock p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. It can be also found on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website along with the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call.

As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","With that, let me hand the call over to Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thank you, Tina, and thank you all for joining us today. Lam delivered results stronger than targeted for the September quarter with revenues gross margin and EPS all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. In addition consistent with the commentary made during our last earnings call, we are forecasting the December quarter up sequentially and we would still characterize based on engagements with our customers in our markets and outlook for the first half of 2019 that is somewhat stronger than the second half of 2018.","In aggregate there has been more semiconductor capital investment volatility both upside and downside in 2017 and 2018 than in the recent prior years and that is only extenuated by broader macro headlines such as trade, tariffs and interest rates. Despite this context, we remain very excited by the long-term drivers for data economy enablement from the world of silicon and the complements of our products and services portfolio to the technology roadmap of the industry. In our opinion, next generation device and systems architectures, the expansion of the materials in chip design and manufacturing creates compelling opportunities for our strength in etch and deposition. We remain committed to invest and innovate for the success of our customers and our company.","As always the performance of Lam is defined by customer trust and employee commitments to our vision and values. We sincerely appreciate that partnership the opportunity created and the numerous contributions made. Since our July update, current year WFE expectations continue to track up slightly year-over-year although to a modestly reduced extent. At a segment level 2018, WFE looks a little stronger in logic, a little weaker in NAND and foundry to the assumptions we made three months back. With customer and Lam performance consistent with our December quarter revenue guidance provided today, calendar 2018 would represents a healthy revenue growth year of 14% for the company with profit performance marginally stronger versus the calendar year 2017 benchmark.","In deposition, we continue to see evidence of Lam\u2019s growing strategic relevance to the success of our customers with key penetrations of new films for patterning, new specialty applications for 3D NAND and deeper partnership models emerging for 3D NAND applications. In etch perhaps our most critical area of focus in 3D NAND is the continued enablement of customers increasingly challenging technology roadmaps where we continue to strengthen our leading capabilities in high aspect ratio applications. Our solutions are invested in customers\u2019 vision for continued 3D NAND scaling targeted to accelerate demand elasticity in their markets for the next several years. Combined etch and deposition market share penetration and defense activity is a net positive so far for Lam in calendar 2018.","Fundamental to the quality and sustainability of Lam earnings is the performance delivered by our Customer Support Business Group. Our installed base business has grown year-to-date at a pace more than two times faster than our installed base unit growth during the same period. Our worldwide process chamber counts now exceed 55,000 units compared to 36,000 units at the end of 2014 and this is the foundation for ongoing spares, service and upgrade revenues. We are increasingly focused on value creation for our customers through investments made in equipment intelligence products. We are providing performance enhancement in areas such as tool analytics, preventive maintenance and chamber matching to enhance productivity for our customers and create opportunity for Lam.","In addition driven by our customers aspirations of better asset utilization in addressing the non-leading edge and also the emergence of new IoT and MEMS silicon opportunities, our reliance business recorded calendar year-to-date growth of more than 35% versus the same period in 2017, a good illustration we believe of Lam\u2019s ability to be flexible in addressing the full scope of our market opportunities. In closing, the September quarter and our outlook on December are largely as we shared with you last earnings call and should deliver more than $3 billion in cash from operations this year. We remain focused on investing in our profitable growth objectives at the same time delivering value through a balanced cash redistribution to shareholders.","In this regard incorporating December 2018 quarter guidance provided today, year-over-year operating expenses increased by 9% with 75% of that growth focused on R&D and our fully diluted quarterly share count reduces by approximately 10% end of year 2018 versus end of year 2017. We anticipate a healthy long-term opportunity for our customers and our company both with continued attention placed on strategies intended to deliver targeted returns on the investments that each market participant makes.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Great, thank you, Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Lam executed well in the September quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all of our financial metrics. Operating margin and earnings per share were at the high end of the guidance range provided demonstrating what I think is discipline in our spending during a decline in industry capital equipment investments. We\u2019re pleased with our execution and ability to respond to the challenging business environment.","As a reminder to everybody, we adopted ASC 606 in the September quarter, which is the first quarter of our 2019 fiscal year. Under 606 we generally record revenue at the time of shipment rather than at the time of customer acceptance. With this new standard, we are no longer providing shipment numbers. Our market segment disclosures will be based on the composition of our revenue numbers for the quarter and we\u2019ll do that now as well as into the future.","So let me get into that. Memory revenue continued to be strong with the combined memory segment making up 77% of total system revenue. Our overall non-volatile memory revenue remained strong representing approximately 51% of the system revenue and that\u2019s despite the anticipated reduction of spending in nearly every one of our NAND customers. DRAM represented 26% of system revenue. DRAM spending in the quarter continued to be focused on conversions to both the 1x and 1y nanometer node.","The foundry segment was stronger in the quarter accounting for 17% of system revenue. And finally, the logic and other segment contributed 6% of system revenue, pretty much consistent throughout calendar 2018. We continue to see strength in the China region with 25% of our revenue being generated there. The strength in China came from both foundry as well as memory. Nearly two thirds of the revenue in September came from domestic Chinese customers. We delivered revenues of $2,331 million in the September quarter, a decrease of 25% from June and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance.","Gross margin for the quarter came in at 46.4%. And as we\u2019ve shared before, our actual gross are a function of several factors, such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter were down to $451 million, which was a decrease of $57 million from the June quarter. R&D comprised nearly two thirds of our total spending consistent with the composition of the June quarter operating expenses.","We continue to maintain a higher concentration of spending in R&D as we believe that discipline R&D investments are critical to achieving our future revenue growth. One thing I\u2019d like to mention to help you with your future P&L modeling. When we get to the March quarter of next year, we will have an extra work week in our fiscal quarter. This occurs approximately every six years due to our fiscal calendar cutoff. March spending will be higher as a result of the extra work week. So, keep that in mind as you put your March models together please.","Operating income in the September quarter came in at $630 million. Operating margin came in at the top of the guidance range of 27% primarily due to stronger gross margin performance as well as flexibility in our spending in a quarter of lower business volumes. The non-GAAP tax rate for the September quarter was 11.9% in line with the guidance provided last quarter.","In the longer run, tax rate in the low- to middle-teens is a right level to include in your models. And I will point out that you will see fluctuations around this quarter-to-quarter. Based on share count, we\u2019re approximately 165 million shares. Earnings per share for the September quarter were $3.36, again at the high end of a guided range. The primary driver of the upside versus our guidance was stronger profitability. The share count includes dilution from the 2041 convertible notes and the 2018 warrants that are still outstanding.","The total dilutive impact for each \u2013 for both of these, excuse me, was approximately eight million shares. And I\u2019ll remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. In the September quarter, we had about $80 million in early conversions of the 2041 notes. Remaining balance of the 2041 notes is $248 million.","We continue to execute on our capital return program. In the September quarter, we committed approximately $1.7 billion towards share repurchases deploying all of our current Board authorization from a dollar perspective. Our repurchases were executed largely through accelerated share repurchase programs that will cover repurchases until the March quarter of 2019. For dividends following the declaration of $1.10 per share the last quarter, we paid out $174 million in dividends to our shareholders.","Let me now shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, decreased in the quarter to $3.9 billion and that compares with $5.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, the change largely due to our capital return activities. We continue to make progress bringing our cash on shore. Cash from operations for the September quarter remained strong at $720 million, which was roughly flat with the $718 million we generated in the June quarter.","DSO increased by nine days to 72 days, which is related to the linearity of revenue during the quarter.","Inventory was roughly flat in dollar terms, while inventory turns declined to 2.7 times. This compares to 3.5 times in the prior quarter. We do expect to see turns improve in the December quarter.","Company noncash expenses included approximately $50 million for equity comp, $36 million for amortization and $44 million for depreciation.","Capital expenditures were $56 million, which was down from $80 million in the June quarter. For the calendar year, we expect CapEx in 2018 will be flat to slightly higher, compared to 2017 levels. CapEx this year is going towards investment in manufacturing expansion for our installed base business, as well as strategic R&D investments. We exited the quarter with approximately 11,000 regular full time employees, which was relatively consistent with the June quarter.","So now looking ahead, I\u2019d like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2.5 billion plus or minus $150 million. We\u2019re expecting a modest uptick in customer spending across multiple segments, gross margin of 46% plus or minus one percentage point, operating margins of 27.5% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $3.65 plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 163 million shares.","Consistent with our prior comments we forecast that September quarter marks a near-term trough for our business. While near-term forecasts are subject to change we remain optimistic on our longer term growth prospects that we highlighted during our investor event back in March. We continue to prioritize disciplined investments that drive competitively differentiated products, as well as Lam\u2019s out performance opportunity into the future.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from C. J. Muse with Evercore.","C. J. Muse","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first question is, as you think about your first half, outlook for calendar 2019 definitely coming in stronger, I think, than many of us thought. Can you walk through, I guess, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of tools versus service? And then if there\u2019s anything that we should be thinking about that is perhaps maybe Lam specific or timing of say image sensors coming in, we would love to kind of hear your thoughts on that front.","Martin Anstice","Yes needless to say we\u2019re much more qualified to speak to our business than we are kind of like the overall kind of WFE headlines. So, when we think about kind of calendar 2019, obviously there has been some continuous, I would say, muting of investment expectations primarily in NAND flash since our last earnings call. We\u2019re looking at 14 new projects next year, fab projects next year. And I would expect honestly in the second half 2018 to first half 2019 comparison, that our revenue levels will be incrementally higher in DRAM logic other including image sensors to your points and also foundry. I would expect NAND to be down half, over half, second half 2018, compared to first half 2019.","Relative to the proportion of our kind of revenue headlines that is the spares and services, the installed base business, obviously it\u2019s a very important part of the economics of the company. And we\u2019ve given some color today on the pace of growth of that business by referencing the installed base and the annuity that comes with it and it\u2019s an important part of the value proposition here. But I would say our headlines for first half WFE are through the systems\u2019 headlines for the markets and the customers that we have. So hopefully that helps C. J.","C. J. Muse","Very helpful. And if I could ask a follow-up, you\u2019ve always done a great job of managing OpEx. And given, I guess, the increased volatility Doug, how are you thinking about incremental margins from here? I think targeted model is roughly 40%. Is that still the right kind of model up or down depending on the revenue run rate?","Doug Bettinger","Well C. J. I think you rewrote our model. Our model is 32% to 33% in the longer term.","Martin Anstice","Yes you see you\u2019re too used to C. J. these memory companies with 40% to 50% operating income, that it tainted you.","C. J. Muse","Yeah.","Doug Bettinger","But, C. J. to more directly ask you question, at these revenue levels kind of high 20s, you just saw us print 27 and guide 27.5, and as things recover and get stronger, you\u2019ll see us kind of inch our way towards that low 30s level. That\u2019s the right way to be thinking about things. There will be variability in spending. And one of the things I\u2019ve purposefully pointed out is the March quarter is a 14-week quarter, so there\u2019s an extra work week in there. And I\u2019ll remind you that in the first half of the year you get certain spending coming back in like payroll taxes and things like that. So don\u2019t forget those things as you\u2019re modeling the next couple of quarters. But hopefully that answered your question.","C. J. Muse","Very helpful, thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks C. J.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the solid results. I guess Doug my first question really kind of an accounting question around 606 and deferred revenue, there was a big draw down in the September quarter, sequentially in deferred revenue. How does that line sort of transition over time? Under 606 will that eventually get a zero? How quickly will you get there? And is there going to be uptick in December sort of revenue guidance, a function of just deferred revenue coming down off the balance sheet?","Doug Bettinger","Yes so briefly I\u2019ll go through it John and you can ask me more if you to understand a little more. I mean basically what happened is we crossed into the new fiscal year is there was a bucket of deferred revenue that just fell straight to retained earnings. So that just fell off and is largely why our deferred revenue went down so much quarter-on-quarter. You\u2019ll continue to see deferred revenue though, John, for first of a kind tools, and certain BPA accrual type things that isn\u2019t completely delivered yet, it\u2019ll bounce around a little bit.","And generally the way I think about the difference between 605 and 606 is, it\u2019s all just timing. We\u2019re still shipping tools, we\u2019re still collecting cash, all of that is happening in the same timeframe that otherwise would have. In some quarters 606 revenue recognition will be higher than 605, in some quarters I would expect it\u2019ll flip and go the other way. But at the end of the day this is all just timing and what really matters in my mind is when cash is coming into the company and as I think you saw, we had a really strong cash collection quarter at $720 million. Does that help John?","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful, it does. And then maybe for my follow-up to Martin, Martin, I think, one of the investor concerns out there is, as the industry transitioned from planer to 3D NAND and the rush to get there by your customers just created kind of a once in a lifetime type kind of bulge in NAND CapEx that\u2019s not repeatable. I\u2019m kind of curious as we go through this soft period in NAND, has your view of capital intensity, your SAM or the rate at which your customers are making these transitions changed. And are you still have the mindset that 32 to 64 was probably the most efficient transmission for the industry and as we go from here things get more difficult. Any color there would be helpful.","Martin Anstice","Yes. I mean lot of questions here. So at a fundamental level no real change in our long-term outlook and that\u2019s a commentary on capital intensity needed for the industry. And we floated at $70 billion reference at the Flash Summit conference a year back, I think maybe repeated again this year actually, so two years in a row same message. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever really offered an opinion about efficiency of one node or another, but I would certainly align to the fact that\u2019s the challenges gets more complex over time as aspect ratios increase, which is a big part of the opportunity for us. That\u2019s where we\u2019re strong and differentiated.","So I think that trends well. And we don\u2019t see the opportunity for 3D NAND as a once in a lifetime gig or a one time event, right? Clearly there were some transitional investments associated with playing a capacity to 3D, there are also investments associated with one generation 3D to next and we did a pine in earlier disclosure that over the next five years I think we expect about 1 million wafer starts per month of incremental capacity to get brought to the system associated with the long-term outlook for nonvolatile memory in this world of data.","So from an industry point of view more or less the same. And I guess the one thing I didn\u2019t say is independent of what your view is, good or bad, you should recognize that the segments of action deposition are entirely central and fundamental to that transition. And so, if everybody does well or everybody has opportunity, we should have more and if nobody does so well we should outperform. So that\u2019s an important headline as well.","John Pitzer","Helpful. Thanks guys.","Martin Anstice","Yes. Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Krish Shankar with Cowen and Company.","Krish Shankar","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Few of them, first one, Martin, if you look at this downturn clearly or this downdraft clearly led by memory. Looks like the CapEx for the WFE cuts have been in retaliation to pricing declines. So from your vantage point, do you think pricing is a key metric to look for to see when it trough and if so, do you think WFE trials for memory along with pricing? And do you have any view on when it\u2019ll happen? And I have a follow-up?","Martin Anstice","Well, I mean, I think that\u2019s a very important question and quite a complicated one. Clearly there\u2019s a relationship of pricing to investment levels. And I would say that in two ways. The first one is, ASPs should reflect supply and demand balance of capacity. So to the extent the prices are going up or going down, there\u2019s an implied message around the need to add capacity or the needs to kind of reign in capacity. So, that\u2019s been the world we\u2019ve lived in for many, many, many years.","What\u2019s a little different today is that pricing is not actually a great leading indicator right now of the customer\u2019s ability to afford to make investments. So back to my rather amusing response to Tim\u2019s earlier question, when the memory companies are making 40% to 50% profits when DRAM is $100 billion business, when flash has grown in the way that it has the sustainability of investments is clearly enabled in ways that wasn\u2019t true three or five years ago.","Now having said all of that, I think our customer spends money adding capacity when they have demand from their customers to ship devices. So I don\u2019t think people get carried away at any level these days. So it\u2019s a bit more complicated than it used to be. Pricing is relevant to help you understand supply and demand, but it\u2019s not so relevant in assessing sustainability and the customer\u2019s ability to make capacity or technology related investments. So good luck with your modeling, I guess.","Krish Shankar","Got it, got it. That\u2019s really helpful, Martin. And then just a follow-up, clearly, everyone understand the long-term upside potential for Lam and the industry and WFE bond. I\u2019m just trying to frame the downside. If you look at the first shoot of drop with NAND followed by DRAM, do you worry that things will get worse before they get better? Or do you think they\u2019re kind of a dropping at these levels?","Martin Anstice","Well, we are \u2013 if anything, we\u2019re super consistent, right? So my approach has always been to describe what I see and we\u2019ve done that. And we\u2019ll always do that. Good or bad, we\u2019ll tell how we see it. And so, we\u2019ve offered perspective that says December is stronger than September and we expect the first half of next year to be stronger than the second half of this year. And of course we might be wrong. And you have to kind of judge the confidence level of our disclosure and kind of move forward, I guess. So best I can offer you.","Krish Shankar","Got it. Thanks Martin. Thanks for the insight.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Krish.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks so much. I had two, I guess the first question Martin is, if I just hold your wafer fab equipment share and now I\u2019m putting everything in there. But if I just calculate your WFE share for this year and for the last year, it\u2019s up a little bit this year. So if I just hold that into the first half of next year, you\u2019re still annualizing if I give you say, $5 billion worth of revenue in the calendar first half, which was just up a little bit half on half, that would imply that we\u2019re still analyzing to like high 40\u2019s to close to $50 billion WFE. So, I guess the question is, who really knows about the calendar second half? But would you sort of endorse a number close to $50 billion for 2019 WFE?","Martin Anstice","Technically it\u2019s too early for us to answer that question. It\u2019s pretty customary that we have a response to that in the January earnings call. But fair question, I don\u2019t have the crystal ball, so I can\u2019t answer it with the same level of confidence, so I can answer the near-term questions. But a very interview question might be how do I feel today about the $100 billion two year reference that\u2019s been floated around for the last kind of few months. It\u2019s not a bad reference. We\u2019re trending a tweak below that right now to our analytics. But we\u2019ve trended a little above it at times and a little below and I can\u2019t really tell you what the variability is around it. But that would probably be the best I could give you at this point in time.","Timothy Arcuri","Awesome. Thank you. And then Doug, it was a pretty big repo this quarter and I understand that it\u2019s going to sort of play out through the end of March. But I\u2019m curious if you can help us on share count for December and March as this kind of flows through. And then also how you think about when you\u2019re going to kind of re-up for the repo, how you kind of think about that? Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, I mean, Tim it\u2019s always an ongoing conversation at a board level. We described when we first launched this current authorization at 12 to 18 month timeframe, maybe we\u2019ve gotten through it a little sooner. I did purposefully point out that those ASRs are going to execute kind over a six month timeframe or not out of the market even though all the cash got deployed. When I have something to update you on, I\u2019ll update you relative to what we\u2019re going to do in the future. Obviously it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be talking about, but I don\u2019t have anything to tell you today.","Timothy Arcuri","But just on the share count though, how it actually plays out, how it actually plays through for December and March. Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Yes. I just guided you that December number of 163 million. I didn\u2019t give you anything for March and we only guide one quarter at a time, Tim, so.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. Awesome, Doug. Thanks so much.","Doug Bettinger","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. We were at the Flash Memory Summit when the Lam team had its investor event and we also had the opportunity to hear from some of the existing NAND leaders in the market as well as some potential entrants from China who seemed to be making some progress and talked about increasing their manufacturing footprint next year. We\u2019ve also heard the same thing from some of the China domestic DRAM suppliers, albeit at lower levels of production activity. Do you think that China domestic memory starts to become a bigger part of your memory WFE mix looking into next year?","Doug Bettinger","Yes.","Martin Anstice","Yes, probably does, Harlan, yes.","Harlan Sur","Both NAND and DRAM, you think?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, probably. As you observed from Flash Memory, the NAND guys in China were a little more visible, maybe a little more confident there. But I think they\u2019re both going to increment\u2026","Martin Anstice","But I don\u2019t think our fundamental view on China is any different today than it was for the last couple of years. I mean, it\u2019s clearly an ambitious, but in our opinion, quite rational strategic agenda. And as each quarter passes there\u2019s more substance to what they\u2019re doing and we don\u2019t have anything more to add than what I think they\u2019re speaking to in the public markets on their. And obviously independent of all of that the long-term market participants are also investing for next-generation device architectures and market share growth and so on and so forth. So, I mean, it\u2019s a global system and that\u2019s what we respond to. But I think it\u2019s likely that the investment level in China increases in absolutes and proportional terms next year per Doug\u2019s response.","Harlan Sur","Great, thanks. I just had a quick follow-up. It\u2019s pretty amazing, the amount of supply side, disciplined and focused on profitability and free cash flow by your memory customers and clearly they want to maintain strong profitability levels by modulating supply. If I look at the last time there was a strong focus on sort of reign in supply that was kind of 2016. It took about two quarters of strong equipment spending declines before we did see a positive response in memory placing fundamentals and economics for your customers. Is that how the Lam team still thinks about it as well i.e. that supply discipline in the second half of this year potentially positively impacts supply dynamics and maybe stronger possibility in the first half of next year for your customers?","Martin Anstice","Wow. I\u2019m not showing that, but I\u2019ll answer that. I mean I would say everything moves faster. So, I think our customers adjust faster and therefore that\u2019s probably true on the upside as much as it is on the downside. We\u2019re a big part of feeding variability along with other market participants for the economics of their business. And I think they take actions anticipating risks as much as ever and that\u2019s a lot more than would be true five or 10 years ago when action would get taken when there was a clear problem statement. So yes, there are supply and demand imbalances that are getting adjusted too. There\u2019s also proactive actions to manage the risk of that. So that\u2019s a good thing I think in the long-term.","Harlan Sur","Yes.","Martin Anstice","I mean it kind of gets to this \u2013 it gets to the message that the secular headlines for us feel like they\u2019re more important than stronger than the cyclical launch, but you have to make your own decision I guess.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Harlan.","Harlan Sur","Thanks for the insights.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Moore [Morgan Stanley].","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you. Following up on that last question. I guess, I was surprised at how strong China was in the September quarter and I think you talked about two thirds of that being from domestics, that seems like a pretty big deviation. Is there anything we should be aware of there and how much of that is kind of memory versus you\u2019re sort of the foundry customers, who you\u2019ve seen more frequently?","Doug Bettinger","Yes. I mean Joe, I\u2019ve pointed it out, because it was an uptick from the local guys and I want them to let you know that. I don\u2019t know you\u2019re going to see that every single quarter in fact, I know you won\u2019t. And interestingly, when I look at kind of who the customers are, and I won\u2019t name them by name that there was relative balance between foundry as well as memory.","Martin Anstice","And logic actually\u2026","Doug Bettinger","Actually in logic, you\u2019re right, Martin. So, it was \u2013 it was a strong quarter for us in China and it was a balanced quarter. I mean, my take on this thing answer is, we tend to talk about collectively two or three \u2013 two or three core domestic participants in China. Reality is, there are kind of six or seven.","Martin Anstice","Yes, there\u2019s more.","Doug Bettinger","And some of them are active at 300, some of them are interactive at 200 millimeter, some of them are active at leading edge technologies and some less leading edge, but there\u2019s a fairly meaningful population that doesn\u2019t maybe get fully internalized.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you very much.","Martin Anstice","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.","Romit Shah","Yes, thank you. I guess just, as outsiders that all the data points on memory equipment CapEx and fundamentals to seemingly seemed all bad during the quarter and yet you exhausted your entire buyback and you\u2019re reiterating your expectations for growth in December. So, is it fair Martin, just to sort of sum up this report by saying that maybe, your business is more diversified than we realized and you\u2019re confident in September being the bottom. And the question really is just sort of the shape of the recovery from here being either U or V-shaped?","Martin Anstice","Well, I think we\u2019ve been talking to the subject of diversification now for, it\u2019s kind of three or four years. No question we\u2019re more diversified today than we were. I think we\u2019ve tried to reinforce that message even more than talking about share gains in foundry and share gains in logic by speaking to the SAM expansion headlines. And in the last kind of the year or so, we\u2019ve segwayed into the installed base business of the company, which is not only a great asset relative to creating an opportunity for competitive differentiation in the core systems products of the company, it\u2019s a source of revenue and profit growth at a rate that is faster than the pace of growing our installed base.","I mean there\u2019s a massive difference between 55,000 process chambers and 36,000 process chambers relative to the annuity. So that\u2019s all kind of in the mix as well. So, the business is more or less as we had anticipated slightly muted to the expectations of three months ago. But not that much different, I mean, I actually think our calendar 18 WFE number is 98% or 99% exactly what it was three months ago. So, I mean, that\u2019s kind of basic headline there and we\u2019ve expressed an outlook for the first half of next year and we\u2019re not going to put numbers on it now. We\u2019ll kind of deal with that in January. So that will be the time when we or you become some obvious disclosure from the Lam.","Romit Shah","Okay. thanks for that. And just on the buyback you\u2019ve exhausted it. So do we have to wait till the next conference call to hear about the size and scope of the next authorization?","Doug Bettinger","Well, even though the cash like I said, Romit, the cash got all committed. We\u2019re still in the market through these structured products, so\u2026","Romit Shah","Okay.","Doug Bettinger","And that was purposeful, right, taken a view of pricing, where things were at and wanting to get on with it. But the way this generally works is Martin and I all agree, here is what we think we should do. We\u2019ll go on and we\u2019ll have a conversation with the board and the board will have opinions. So, we\u2019ll modify it and when we have a decision, we will communicate it to you and we\u2019re not at that point yet.","Romit Shah","Okay. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yes. Thanks, Romit.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Martin, maybe a question on your services business. If say, hypothetically WFE goes down 5% or 10% next year, what does that imply for your services business? Can you still keep it flat or even grow it? Just what is just the conceptual sensitivity to WFE?","Martin Anstice","Well, in the calendar year, there\u2019s not so much sensitivity, because in general, when we ship a system to customer, it has a 12-month warranty, so it\u2019s kind of on our dime during that period. The single biggest influence over the size of the installed base businesses, the number of kind of units in the installed base for which we disclosed and then the utilization of fabs. So if you \u2013 if we show up in the worlds with the WFE reduction that you\u2019ve just characterized and there is no change in utilization of the installed base, then there\u2019s no consequence. If the utilization of the installed base goes up, you\u2019re likely to see accelerated growth and if the installed base utilization goes down, you see a contraction and spares of service business in the industry. So, our assumption is in the context of customers have done a really good job kind of managing this issue, utilizations will run pretty high and we have no reason to be anxious about a dip in our installed base revenues.","In an independent world, as spoken to you for some time now, a little bit here today in prepared comments, we are perpetually building a portfolio of installed base productivity related products and service offerings and invested in contributing more to the success of our customers and creating opportunity for Lam. So, there\u2019s some things in our control and some things that are out of our control.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And as a follow-up from what you see today, do you think memory CapEx overall is up or down next year and when do you typically get visibility around what the spending environment will be?","Martin Anstice","Perfectly normal timing where it will give you more color on next year would be in next quarter\u2019s earnings call. It\u2019s just a little bit too early for us to give on the specificity you\u2019re asking for.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Yes. Thank you so much. Martin, you\u2019ve talked about logic revenue being up in the first half of 2019 relative to the second half of 2018. Is the big driver there basically your key customers CapEx budget going up or is it more due to your positioning improving from say 14 to 10 nanometer or is it both?","Martin Anstice","It\u2019s both.","Doug Bettinger","It\u2019s a little bit of both.","Toshiya Hari","Okay. And then kind of related to that, if you were to \u2013 in terms of magnitude, you guided DRAM, logic and foundry all power for over half. If you had to rank order those three in terms of the magnitude increase from the second half to the first half, is that something that you guys can do?","Martin Anstice","I haven\u2019t written down on a piece of paper in front of me and now decided like that \u2013 I\u2019d like to tell you. So, rank order without any numbers, I would say logic and it\u2019s kind of other logic, which includes, the image sensor opportunities and the legacy stuff, it\u2019s probably the fastest-growing. And DRAM is the slowest-growing and foundries probably in the middle. That would be kind of \u2013 and I\u2019m not speaking to kind of industry level here, I\u2019m just characterizing the revenue kind of outlook for Lam, and as I said, NAND\u2019s contractions, so that will be our rank order.","Toshiya Hari","Okay.","Martin Anstice","Yes. It\u2019s like pretty early to be having those conversations. So, take it for what it\u2019s worth at this point.","Toshiya Hari","Sure. As a quick follow-up, I just had a question on market share. Martin, clearly, if you\u2019re growing your business 14% this year, you\u2019re gaining a bit of share. In your prepared remarks, you\u2019ve talked about some of your net wins, both in dep and etch. Is it fair to say in relation to your long-term model, where you\u2019ve attached $1 billion incremental revenue for market share gains? Are you tracking in line or ahead of that plan or how would you describe, where you stand today relative to the long-term plans?","Martin Anstice","Was never linear as it\u2019s a tough question to answer. But a couple of data points. So, when we talk about kind of penetration defense activities this year, we\u2019re actually talking more about the economics that will play out a year from now or maybe even in 2020, right, because there\u2019s a leading a timeframe on DTOR decisions and PTOR decisions and you might remember that in the last earnings call, I think I made referenced to the fact that there were tons of decisions in relative terms in the second half of this year compared to the first half of this year.","So, that\u2019s kind of a loss still ahead of us. So, fair game for you to ask the same question to me to try and answer it in January. So far, again, we don\u2019t \u2013 we never think though that we defend everything, but we have a net positive to forward-looking kind of economics from the penetrations and defenses in the first nine months of this year. So pretty, pretty pleased.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Toshiya.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Martin, first off, just I guess follow-up on some of your comments on named capital intensity, but looking at it from the DRAM front, as the industry continues to push the 1X, 1Y, eventually to 1Z, we\u2019re seeing a lot of new fab projects in DRAM. Do you believe these capital intensity trends are also impacting DRAM and this could provide a little bit of, I guess, sustainability on some of the equipment spending trends that we\u2019re seeing today?","Martin Anstice","I think it\u2019s all about kind of the economics on the revenue of the customer honestly. I think what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years is, obviously, an emergence of significant discipline, managing supply and demand, and there has been an ASP consequence, but more than that, we\u2019ve seen a transition away from units to content and density in a broader set of demand drivers. And that has allowed our customers to kind of reset the value of the bits that they\u2019re selling to their customers. So, the average bit is worth kind of more by virtue of the value that\u2019s created in this kind of broader cognitive computing environments. And so if there continues to be discipline and if our customers continue to be successful getting paid for the enabled ones in their industry, the fact that from one generation to the next, the DRAM cost transitions are kind of less significant compared to the baseline of five to 10 years ago. It\u2019s much less relevance, right?","I mean clearly when no transitions deliver less than they did in history, there\u2019s a lot of intensity by the customer and there\u2019s a lot of intensity by Lam and our peer companies. I\u2019m sure to try and continue to improve the productivity of the DRAM installed base, because we have a collective interest in that. But I think the bigger question to answer relative to DRAM capital intensity is the revenue side of it, not the cost side of it. But as I said three times today, in my \u2013 go ahead?","Patrick Ho","As my follow-up question for Doug, in terms of the services and spare parts business, you mentioned that you have a little bit of the CapEx spend; the increase is incrementally going into that business segment. How much can you leverage, I guess your existing workforce in terms of growing that business on the labor side of things, or is that an area where you\u2019ll also have to increase OpEx to keep up with the fast pace of growth in that business?","Doug Bettinger","Patrick, it\u2019s a different physical factor in a different location. So, there\u2019s not a lot of leverage from a labor standpoint and we have to invest in manufacturing, the parts for manufacturing. So, it\u2019s all goodness at the end of the day, it\u2019s supporting a higher installed base and we got to make investments for that.","Patrick Ho","Great. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick one on kind of nano-secular technology. Is there any of your customers that have already started working on that or is that something that it\u2019s told to come next year?","Martin Anstice","Unfortunately, our customers have to answer that question.","Mitch Steves","Okay. Got it. And then secondly, on the DRAM side, do you guys see any, I guess \u2013 I guess, when would you guys think that the pricing would stabilize in DRAM in general, or do you guys have no view right now?","Martin Anstice","Well, we have a view, but I think the view of our customers again, is worth a lot more than ours. I mean it\u2019s all about supply and demand, and our customers have taken action, I would argue proactively as much as reactively. And so everything moves pretty fast these days. So again, customer\u2019s disclosure is worth a lot more than ours on ASPs of devices.","Mitch Steves","Got it. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Mitch.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc.","Weston Twigg","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re seeing any change in customer behavior related to trade work insurance whether that\u2019s in terms of the conversations you\u2019re having with them or the visibility that they\u2019re providing or commitments regarding new fab capacity heading into 2019. Any color would be helpful?","Martin Anstice","Yes. To the best of my knowledge, nothing\u2019s really changing directly related to that, although I\u2019ve kind of heard a few statements and read a few things quoted about customers\u2019 kind of referencing terrorists or the costs of terrorists when it comes to the pace at which they\u2019re making investments. In fact, I think I read one today out of Taiwan. So, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not irrelevant. I mean, to the extent that a company has more of costs, because of terrorists and we probably all do at some level. There is a consequence of that and there is a reprioritization of things in the company. So, not irrelevance, but hard for us to kind of directly correlates. I\u2019m just conscious that I\u2019m seeing statements and I\u2019m hearing some things. And so it\u2019s in the mix of the outlook that we\u2019ve described today.","Weston Twigg","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow-up question is just on DRAM strength in the first half that you mentioned, is there a strength from \u2013 more from some of the pushouts you\u2019re seeing from this half, is it related to new capacity or is it more just ongoing conversion activity?","Martin Anstice","It\u2019s mostly as originally planned. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a massive kind of statements. So, there are not so many industry participants in any segment these days. So, you probably got a sense of who is chasing who and who is investing where for what purpose. So, I think it was pretty much originally as consistent with plan.","Weston Twigg","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin Anstice","Thanks, Weston.","Tina Correia","Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question please.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. Doug, going back to your commentary by the extra week in the march quarter, which is leading to higher expenses, should I also assume that your revenue would be positively impacted for an extra week?","Doug Bettinger","Well, technically we have an extra week to shift product, Mehdi, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to meaningfully move the revenue number. I do know definitively, it will impact the expenses. we\u2019ll give you the hard guide when we did get the end of the quarter though.","Mehdi Hosseini","Okay. And then just \u2013 I just want to go back to your comment about the deferred revenue. And if I just do a simple math, I get to shipment down 35% on a sequential basis. Is that \u2013 does that make sense to you?","Doug Bettinger","Mehdi, we\u2019re not getting shipment anymore. We\u2019re not talking about shipment anymore.","Mehdi Hosseini","No. this is for the September quarter. This is for the September quarter.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, yes. We\u2019re done talking about shipments publicly; revenue is all we\u2019re going to be describing now. You can do analytics on whatever you want to get shipments, but at the end of the day, given the change in the revenue recognition timing, revenue is what we\u2019re going to be talking about.","Mehdi Hosseini","Okay, that\u2019s great. Just a follow-up on your services, given the increased installed system, are these service contracts long enough to actually have an impact on your backlog? Does that help you with better visibility?","Doug Bettinger","Yes.","Mehdi Hosseini","So, if that\u2019s the case and assuming that services is becoming a larger part of your revenue mix, why not offer a longer guide on the revenues rather than just referring to WFE?","Doug Bettinger","We\u2019ll think about it, Mehdi. I mean at the end of the day, we tried to describe what we think is important for you to understand what\u2019s going on in the business. There\u2019s still just a large amount of the business in any one quarter that\u2019s turns based. And to me, backlog isn\u2019t that meaningful, for services, it\u2019s certainly as just Martin said. So, we\u2019ll give you some thought.","Mehdi Hosseini","Because just the growth in installed system is very compelling, but it still hasn\u2019t made a difference to how you guide and I\u2019m just wondering what is the disconnect here?","Martin Anstice","I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s actually true. I think for the last couple of quarters you have perspective some times quantitative and some times qualitative on the progression for a couple of quarters including today. So, it\u2019s pretty hard to do what we\u2019re doing and as many people characterize that we don\u2019t have the visibility to say what we currently say as those to do. So take it for what it\u2019s worth, we\u2019re doing the best we can.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Mehdi.","Mehdi Hosseini","Thank you.","Operator","And speakers, as we have no more questions, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.","Martin Anstice","Okay. With that, we\u2019ll conclude the call. Thank you, operator.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. you may now disconnect and have a great rest of the day."],"13363":["Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) Q4 2012 Earnings Call July 25, 2012  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Shanye Hudson - Director of Investor Relations","Ernest E.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Lam Research Corporation June 2012 Quarterly Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Shanye Hudson, Director of Investor Relations.","Please go ahead.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you, Douglas. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Lam Research Corporation's quarterly conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ernie Maddock, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Shortly, Ernie will discuss financial results for the June 2012 quarter and outline some of the impacts associated with our Novellus acquisition. Martin will then share Lam's business outlook for the September 2012 quarter and combined company guidance before opening up the call for Q&A.","The press release detailing our financial results was distributed over the wire services shortly after 1 p.m. this afternoon and is available on our website at lamresearch.com.","Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements including those related to our expectations for the global macroeconomic environment of market size; wafer fab equipment spending; market share changes; consumer demand, customer spending and behavior and the factors that will influence those expectations as well as our spending projections; our investment plans; our business strategies; our aspirations of the benefits with our merger with Novellus; our intentions for research and development activities, our contemplated tax rate and our forecast of market shares, shipments, revenues, expenses, margins operating profits, share repurchase activities, earnings per share and cash generation on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, as well as other statements of the company's expectations, beliefs and plans.","There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements, and a list of these factors can be found in the slide package accompanying this conference call and on our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","All forward-looking statements are based on current information and the company assumes no obligation to update any of them. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 p.m. and we ask that you please limit questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up. With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Ernie.","Ernest E. Maddock","Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone. The June quarter marks an important milestone in the history of Lam Research. As you know on June 4, we successfully completed the acquisition of Novellus Systems. Our combined financial results, which are reflected in the press release issued earlier today, include only 20 days of Novellus activity. With that in mind, I'd like to begin my remarks today by reviewing Lam's standalone performance for the June quarter as it relates to the guidance we've provided on our April call.","We ended our fiscal year with solid performance and exceeded the midpoints of our guidance range for all metrics provided. Specifically, shipments were approximately $727 million for the quarter, up 2% from the March quarter, supported by capacity additions for leading etch Foundry customers and DRAM capacity conversions for the 2x and 3x technology nodes. Although moderating, leading edge NAND capacity additions continue to be a meaningful part of the company's shipment profile.","Turning to the breakdown by application and market segment for Lam's standalone shipments, applications for sub 4x technology nodes represented 96% of overall system shipments. Foundry shipments accounted for 48% of total system shipments while the Memory segment accounted for 46% total shipments divided between NAND at 18% and DRAM at 28%. Lastly, Logic and Other constituted the balance of 6%.","Revenue in the June quarter was $716 million, up 9% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 41.9%, up 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a more favorable customer and product mix and improved factory and field utilization. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $195 million versus $197 million in the March quarter. The operating expense level reflects our continued investment in the strategic products and projects offset by favorability related to deferred compensation plan obligations resulting from stock market decline. Lam attempts to mitigate overall plan exposure relative to market fluctuations and the decreased operating expenses were substantively offset in other income and expense.","Non-GAAP operating income was $106 million versus $73 million in the prior quarter and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 14.7%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range on a positive progression from the 11.1% in the March 2012 quarter.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the June quarter was aligned with our expectations at 16.5% compared to the 20.4% for the March quarter. Based on a share count of approximately 117 million shares, June quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.75, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter by $0.03. I'll note once again that all of the data I've just provided is for Lam's standalone and is intended to be compared to our previously provided June quarter guidance.","Prior to presenting the balance sheet for the combined company, I'd like to address a few housekeeping items. First, as we think about fiscal year 2013, as the new Lam, we currently contemplate a tax rate in the midteens. This estimate is subject to further revision as we more thoroughly complete tax planning activities for the combined company and would be favorably impacted should the Federal R&D tax credit be extended. Relative to Novellus on a standalone basis, shipments for the June quarter were approximately $309 million while the combined company recorded it $816 million in shipments for the same period, which includes $89 million of Novellus shipments made after June 4.","Turning now to the balance sheet. The results that follow represent the combined company. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments including restricted cash and investments of $3 billion versus $2.6 billion for Lam's standalone in the prior quarter. This includes approximately $1.1 billion acquired as a result of the Novellus transaction, offset by the impact of our June quarter share repurchase activity, which I will discuss further in a moment.","Relative to DSO and inventory turns while there has been no significant change to the underlying operational performance of either company, June quarter financial results are significantly impacted by the 20 day stop period for Novellus and are not helpful for understanding the companies' overall performance. We foresee a return to more normal external metrics in the September quarter and we will discuss them at that time.","We ended the June quarter with deferred revenue of $335 million excluding approximately $23 million in shipments to Japanese customers that were revenue in future quarters. Approximately $87 million of the deferred revenue balance relates to Novellus products. Combined company non-cash expenses include, among other items, $29 million for equity compensation and $35 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $37 million and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 regular full-time employees, including approximately 2,750 Novellus employees.","During the June quarter, we spent approximately $676 million for share repurchases and took delivery of approximately 16 million shares of common stock. In the September quarter, we expect to receive an additional 2 to 3 million shares associated with our June quarter expenditures resulting in an effective purchase price between $36 and $38 per share. These deliveries will be in addition to any new September quarter repurchases made under the company's ongoing repurchase program.","Before turning over the call to Martin, I'd like to discuss the impact of purchase price accounting rules related to the Novellus transaction. In particular, I'd like to call your attention to 3 areas where you will see the largest impact to our results. I'll explain more about the June quarter impact in a few minutes, which in turn provides the baseline for the September quarter guidance that Martin will be discussing in a few minutes.","First, the transaction required that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities be recorded at current fair value including the inventory acquired from Novellus. This includes finished goods, work in process and raw materials and for the next 2 to 3 quarters, we will have revenue recognized with cost of goods sold values that are higher than the Novellus historical cost. These differences will be noted as a non-GAAP adjustment.","The second area that was impacted by the transaction was revenue. Because Novellus and Lam had differing revenue recognition policies, there will be a delay in recognizing revenue for some Novellus Systems as we transition to Lam's customer acceptance based model. Additionally, due to purchase price accounting rules, we will not be able to recognize the majority of Novellus' deferred revenue that was recorded on its balance sheet as of the day of the transaction close, since the tools had already been physically delivered to customers. This Novellus deferred revenue totaled approximately $37 million.","We expect that these timing differences will be fully normalized within a 2 to 3 quarter period and until then, we'll provide an estimate of their impacts. The circumstances in no way impact the timing or collectability of any customer receivables. Finally, our non-GAAP results will now also exclude the amortization of intangible assets we acquired and valued as of the date of the acquisition.","I'd also like to call your attention to the fact that our GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense will now include the expense associated with the coupon interest of the convertible debt we acquired as part of the transaction, currently estimated at approximately $4.5 million per quarter. As has been the case, our non-GAAP results will continue to exclude acquisition and integration related costs, the amortization of discounts for both companies' convertible notes and other certain nonrecurring items. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in today's press release for a complete review of the exclusion. With that, I'll now turn it over to Martin for his comments.","Martin B. Anstice","Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Lam's June quarter was very successful and I continue to be encouraged by the company's achievements. In addition to delivering targeted financial performance, we closed our acquisition of Novellus and immediately began executing on the objectives we established for the combined company while at the same time, ensuring continued focus on commitments made to our customers as 2 previously standalone companies.","Before I expand on our progress internally, I'd first like to share our views on the current business environment. Since our April call, optimism around macroeconomic strength has waned somewhat and while views for 2012 GDP remain in the 2.5% to 2.7% range, estimates for 2013 growth appear to have weakened to below 3%, a level that is now more consistent with a stable growth outlook year-over-year with potential, we believe, for electronics growth in 2013 in excess of 2012.","It is premature to start predicting 2013 wafer fabrication equipment spending with any certainty clearly. But our initial modeling of IC unit supply and demand would cause us to anticipate that spend would remain around the $30 billion level for a fourth straight year. Continued concerns over the Europe debt crisis, unemployment in the U.S. and questions about the level of China's growth outlook, all have the potential to constrain or negatively impact consumer electronics demand. We expect our customers to continue to focus on aligning their capacity additions with their own view of that demand outlook. One reasonable conclusion is that our near-term future is quite unsettled due to these macro factors. As such, we would now expect 2012 wafer fabrication equipment spending to be at the low end of our previously communicated $30 billion to $32 billion range.","Turning first to the Foundry segments. We continue to expect Foundry WFE spending within a range of $12 billion to $13 billion, driven primarily by demand for leading edge capacity. Specifically, we are still projecting approximately 90,000 wafer starts per month of new 32, 28-nanometer capacity will be added throughout 2012, which supports our prior view for exiting the year with between 220,000 and 240,000 wafer starts per month of 32\/28nm capacity. Given what appears to be a healthy demand for devices manufactured at this technology node, we continue to expect more than 300,000 wafer starts of total capacity to be ultimately installed, a figure that will surpass all prior year Foundry nodes.","Investment timing will depend on several factors including economic uncertainty, competitive dynamics and production performance of our customers. However, our view suggests plenty of runway remains for 28-nanometer Foundry spending. Relative to the Logic markets, the leading edge 22-nanometer production ramp continues. Our outlook for WFE spend in the segment has marginally declined as opportunities for reuse of existing equipment appeared to have increased and the proportion of total CapEx for shelf space is now greater than previously expected. Likely, this bodes well for equipment spending in 2013.","Our view of the DRAM segments has not substantially changed. We continue to see muted investment level supporting the big growth in the low 30% range this year. With virtually no new plant capacity additions in 2012, there remains the potential for supply constraints exiting 2012. Additionally, the sustained economic pressures caused by the proximity of DRAM selling prices to manufacturing costs motivate customers to convert capacity to the most competitive leading edge capability. While this scenario could result in higher levels of DRAM spending in 2013, spending levels will largely be a function of the demand environments. Again, the macros are likely to dominate.","Finally, looking at the NAND segments. We have lowered our second half WFE spend forecast as a couple of customers appear to have delayed their investment plans slightly from the second half of 2012 into early 2013. We have projected NAND's WFE spend to decline by approximately $1 billion year-on-year and to date our figure is likely closer to $2 billion. While our 2012 forecast for NAND's demand drivers such as smartphones and tablet devices have remain healthy, the amount of NAND's capacity in place today we believe can meet the consensus big growth estimates of approximately 65% this year.","The pricing environment can certainly influence investment decisions. NAND's pricing progressively worsened throughout the quarter, although we started to see pricing stabilize. The implications of that are not yet completely clear.","To summarize, despite today's muted macroeconomic environments, our 2012 WFE spend forecast in the $30 billion range is close to historic peak levels. The outlook for sustains 28-nanometer Foundry investment looks good through 2013, the drivers for Lam's capacity additions look good in the long-term, but as stated, we're seeing some timing adjustments recently slowing investments. The DRAM and the microprocessor world both share PC as a primary underlying demand driver and we consider it more likely than not, there is positive unit momentum here in 2013.","Taken together, we remain cautiously optimistic about IC unit demands next year, but acknowledge the uncertainty of our global economy and share the common interests to see these macro questions get answered in the coming months.","Turning now to Lam's business performance. While relatively few new application decisions were made by our customers in the first half of this year, we made positive progress towards a number of targeted growth applications while successfully defending critical positions in etch, single-wafer clean and NAND deposition.","To capture a few headlines. In PECVD, we gained a few critical back-end Logic applications by demonstrating minimal low key film damage combined with repeated [ph] Process results at high productivity. Combined with our strong position in conductor etch patenting steps, we are well-positioned for the Foundry transition to 20 nanometer. Our engagements with leading NAND manufacturers position us well for opportunities resulting from the 3D devices broadly. In dielectric etch, we gained momentum for high aspect ratio etches, considered one of the most challenging etch processes. We have demonstrated the ability to provide tight CD and profile performance without compromising productivity. As a result of these capabilities, we are able to strengthen our position in memory applications and are well-positioned for next generation DRAM decisions and 3D NAND applications.","In deposition, the need to fill these very high aspect ratio features without voids has become increasingly critical to device performance. We believe we are well-positioned to extend our leadership in tungsten CVD with our differentiated extreme FEOL technology which delivers a seam-free FEOL using low resistivity tungsten. Similarly, in PECVD, our ability to deposit multiple layers of ultrasmooth film stacks as high productivity has resulted in multiple customer engagements for 3D NAND device developments.","Finally, in single wafer clean, we continue our next-generation product development efforts which are well underway. These systems combined our different CD drying and chemical retain technologies with targeted newly developed technical and productivity capabilities that will position us to better compete across a more comprehensive set of single wafer clean applications.","As stated before, given the current wafer fab environment, the mix and timing of customer equipment selections and spending, we expect shipped market share will be relatively be neutral for etch deposition and single wafer clean this year. The headlines I've just described reflect our continued focus on our longer-term growth objectives for gaining 3 to 5 percentage points in etch, 5 to 10 percentage points in single wafer clean, and now, 4 to 8 percentage points in deposition over the next 3 to 5 years.","Overall, we're pleased to report again that reflecting back on the first half of the year, the Lam and Novellus continue to execute to each company's established business plans and records, also engaging fully in integration planning and activities associated with closing the transaction. We achieved our objective to transition on day 1 without disruptions to our customers, suppliers or employees, which we consider our highest priority.","With the merger now complete, we are focused on competing as one company on its successful integration and executing the comprehensive plans targeted to achieve accelerated growth and profitability. Our priorities must always include building customer trust, partnership and collaboration without which, our plans are less probable and targeted results, we believe, less sustainable.","We began implementing plans to realize cost synergies immediately, starting with areas where we had identified duplicative resources and services. Although not the primary definition of success for this transaction, we are already spending less money together than we would have done separately. We are on plan and are pleased with the pace of our progress thus far. In the coming quarters, we will share more specifics relative to our performance against target savings of $100 million on an annualized basis exiting 2013.","Our cost reduction synergies are anticipated to deliver benefits each and every quarter this year and next. They are not linear in their impacts, however, and specifically in the middle of next calendar year, they include a step-function reduction of costs related to business process and systems streamlining. We are executing plans to integrate key business processes, management systems and infrastructure which we target to be largely completed within the next 12 months. Especially important is our focus on employees during a period of transition of this scale. Together, our focus has been rewarded by successes in our efforts to retain key employees as we move through the integration process.","Lastly, subsequent to reaching the June 4, 2012, acquisition closing, we were finally able to begin our efforts in earnest to engage with customers on a broad set of opportunities uniquely created by this merging to accelerate their success and ours. As we spend more time meeting jointly with our customers, our confidence in achieving our growth objectives for the combined company has grown higher. We look forward to sharing further details on our plans to achieve substantive revenue synergies over the coming years during our upcoming analyst event which we've now scheduled for November 8.","I'll now share with you our combined company non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter and provide some context that we consider important. Shipments of $950 million, plus or minus, $30 million, revenues of $900 million, plus or minus, $30 million, gross margin at 42.5% plus or minus 1%, operating profit at 10% plus or minus 1.5% and earnings per share of $0.40 plus or minus $0.07, based on a share count of 183 million shares. Worthy of note, the revenue recognition changes that Ernie discussed for Novellus products will also impact our financial statements in the September quarter.","The September quarter guidance I just provided would be improved by the following amounts where it not for the revenue recognition changes. Approximately $100 million of revenue, approximately 1 percentage point of gross margin and approximately $0.25 of earnings per share.","I would like to reemphasize Lam's commitment on a standalone basis to maintain quarterly operating expenses at or below the $200 million level through the remainder of calendar year 2012, and we would expect overall OpEx levels to remain fairly flat in the December quarter from the level implied by our September guidance today.","In closing, I'd like to extend my sincere thanks to the leadership and broad employee population of the combined company who have worked tirelessly to support our stated goals and achievements and thank all of our stakeholders for their continued patience and support to our company through this period of significant transition.","With that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first question, Martin, I was hoping to get an update from you now that you've had some time with the combined company and get a vision from you as to how you see the product portfolio here, whether there's anything that you feel like you need to add or given competitive positioning, you could exit and kind of get an idea of what you'll look like 12, 18 months from now?","Martin B. Anstice","That's a really simple question to ask and a really difficult one to answer. We clearly just began the process of assimilating the 2 companies and certainly, at this point in time, we remain absolutely committed to the full portfolio of products that are -- that define Lam Research and Novellus as 2 standalone companies. As you might expect, we have a clearly stated ambition to be #1 in the market share in all segments that we compete in. And it's true, in at least one Lam business and 1 or 2 deposition businesses from Novellus that we're not the #1 player. So we clearly, as a management team, have to work ahead of us to rationalize the path to being successful against the definition of success that I just described. So the message today to our customers and to our investment community is we're absolutely committed to the portfolio of products that are active in both companies and we've got some work ahead. I would expect potentially that we'll have some more helpful commentary in the November analyst meeting. But frankly, even in that timeline, that's a pretty small amount of time for what I consider to be fairly strategic decisions.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. As a quick follow-up, I guess kind of a 2 part question. In terms of your net cash roughly $2 billion, and so I'm curious, how should we think about share repurchase in the current quarter, particularly at current levels? And also, in terms of the guide at 183 million shares. What are you embedding there in terms of additional repurchase on top of the 2 million to 3 million shares associated with the June quarter program?","Ernest E. Maddock","This is Ernie. We would expect that our September quarter purchases will be more systematic as opposed to some of what we saw in the June quarter with respect to some more structured programs. And so, what was embedded is I would say, relatively more modest than what you saw us do in the June quarter, but nonetheless, will represent another significant step in the overall program. And we'd be currently tracking at these levels during the calendar year, spending somewhere north of 2\/3 or so of the overall authorization with a little bit of wiggle room one either side.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I believe, Martin, you alluded to some progress in terms of Foundry at 20 nanometer in 2013, a very basic question, I was wondering for a fab of 45K wafer per month, what do you think the etch value is at a 20-nanometer Foundry versus at 28?","Martin B. Anstice","So I'm going kind of get you there in kind of building blocks as opposed to answer in one way. The assumption we're making for a 10,000 wafer starts capacity addition in Foundries at 20 nanometer is about $1 billion and we're estimating about $1.3 billion based on kind of public commentary from customers at the 20 nanometer load and maybe it's $1.3 billion, maybe it's a $1.4 billion. It's certainly, meaningly, meaningfully more expensive. And frankly, I would use the kind of traditional 13% of wafer fab estimate for etch as a vehicle for kind of backing into the etch specific answer to your question. There clearly is in the 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer Foundry transition some pretty meaningful process flow related changes for high key metal gates and also, in the area of multiple patenting that I think are net positive to the etch segments and we're positioned to exploit that opportunity when it presents itself.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up is on NAND spending. It sounds like initially you had some expectation of order activity in the second half and that's been pushed into the first half. Is it reasonable to assume that those orders will come in the first quarter of '13 and is that what you're preparing for based on your schedule now?","Martin B. Anstice","A definition of reasonable in this industry is tough to get to. I mean, certainly early 2013 is the expectation. Frankly speaking, we have cycle times in the company that allow us to respond pretty quickly to changes from customers and I expect changes from customers as a natural course of business. So I mean, the reduction appears to be there less in terms of demand, more in terms of kind of cautiousness from a profitability level point of view and pricing from our customers. But I think we're still pretty positive around the long term on NAND as the segment of spending.","Operator","Our next question is from the line Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Martin, really just a quick math on the OpEx. I'm doing some marketing [ph] here, looks like your [indiscernible] OpEx guidance is about $292 million and I can get there by taking the June OpEx and adding it to Novellus' core OpEx from their last supported quarter in March, which I think is pretty good considering I guess perhaps Novellus was under investing. Going forward, you're talking about potentially, you're looking at cost synergies with the Novellus acquisition. I was just wondering how do you think about the OpEx progression beyond the September quarter, especially as it relates to how we should think about investment at Novellus?","Ernest E. Maddock","So Satya, this is Ernie. Martin commented in his remarks that we would expect fairly consistent OpEx for the December quarter and certainly, as we think about 2013, we're going to be doing that in the context of the environment that Martin described a little bit earlier, and so it's a little too early for us to give a perspective on 2013 at this point, but I think you can expect relatively consistent performance to that implied number for the balance of 2012 certainly.","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, Satya, the only thing I would add is, and maybe this is for everybody's benefit, I think it's a little unfair to characterize that Novellus wasn't investing. I think we would all say that in terms relative to the investment profile of Novellus, we were certainly outpacing in terms of some of the engagements we've had with some customers in certain application areas. But the investment profile for the Novellus piece [ph] business has been meaningful, substantive, even -- I would say even including the 450-millimeter wafer size transition preparedness as well. So I think it's fine to consider in relative terms there being a slightly different reality, but it's not quite as binary as was implied by your question.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Thanks for the clarification. Just a quick couple of follow-ups on Foundry and NAND. I guess like, you seem to think there is a bit of runway on 28-nanometer and it seems like the major change in your CapEx outlook is really on the NAND flash side for the year -- from what you thought 3 months ago and now. Just was wondering if you could clarify, if you saw any changes in demand for Foundry shipments in the second half of the year versus your prior expectations, particularly in the September quarter. And for NAND, it's really a very simple question, what do you expect, based on what you're seeing right now for CapEx for NAND this year and your overall plan [ph] for CapEx next year, the bit supply growth would be for NAND in 2013.","Martin B. Anstice","So maybe I'll give you a little bit more data to kind of help you get frames thinking through answering that question. If you look at our guidance, so embedded in the $950 million of shipments guidance, obviously, the primary component of that relates to our systems and the foundry component approximately is in the high 40s, maybe 47% plus or minus a bit, and memory component is about 43% of the shipments guidance, again plus or minus points, and the logic represents the remaining 10%. And within that memory, 43%, the NAND shipments actually are a little stronger in absolute dollars than the DRAM shipments. So that's kind of the context I guess for answering this specific question. Certainly, we've messaged exactly as you hypothesized in your question. The primary change for us against our original assumptions is in NAND and not in Foundry. There's a little bit of movement, but it's not a material enough for me to kind of add to what we have previously stated. You are going to have to ask your question again on the NAND piece on the end. I missed it.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","What do you think in 2013 the supply growth for NAND?","Martin B. Anstice","We are assuming today less bit growth in 2013 than in '12 and I would say the 50% to 55% range is a reasonable stake in the ground at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Martin, I was wondering if you can provide some framework on how we should think about December quarter shipments in light of some of the comments you made about the NAND and DRAM customers. Should we expect at least the Foundry segment to be strong in the December quarter or should that also be relatively weak?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, we had said in our guidance last quarter and in our commentary around the business last quarter, albeit as a standalone company, but frankly, I think the message is the same as the combined company as it was standalone. We had anticipated that calendar 2012, from a shipments perspective, would be reasonably flat, plus or minus a little bit. And clearly, in light of messaging today, that's our wafer fabrication equipment spending outlook for the year. It's at the low end of the range, we would now slightly modify the first half, second half commentary and say that the first half, we believe, is slightly stronger than the second half and I would, of course, in percentages I would put the first half in the low 50s and the second half the high 40s. So that's how you should think about kind of first half and second half at this point of time and I would say that the ratio I just gave you, the low 50s and the high 40s, first half, second half, WFE, is accentuated a little in the foundries. For December, clearly, there's a lot of moving parts and it would be premature for us to be specific about guidance today. Directionally, I'm thinking that our shipments levels will be flat to slightly up over September, but there is a lot of time ahead of us for that to change. But that's the assumption set that we would have today.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And just a follow-up, in the largest segment, I know you guys have a lot of opportunity in your core etch business, have some of the decisions at 14-nanometer have already been made or do you think there's still an opportunity for you guys to gain some traction there?","Martin B. Anstice","I think a lot of decisions are made at this point and clearly, there are still some remaining probably I'm sure and we work hard each and every day as does our competition, I'm sure. And so -- I really have no additional comments from what we've said previously there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Martin, question is really on the microprocessor segment. It's going to be more important to you going forward, both the global foundries and of course through the Novellus acquisition with the exposure to Intel. And if you look at the inventory at the microprocessor companies, it's at the record level now. So the big CapEx in the last couple of years has created significant inventory on the part of the microprocessor companies. And so I wonder, relative to the commentary, if you're feeling good about wafer fab equipment being at near record levels again next year? If you perceive any risk in the microprocessor segment due to inventory or do you think the technology spending has to continue, no matter how much excess inventory those customers have?","Martin B. Anstice","Yes, I mean, I think relative to this specific [ph] inventory, we're probably one of the least qualified companies to answer that question. Hopefully, our customers in that segment are more qualified. But we're not seeing a significant message there. I mean, the commentary around 2013 was more a statement that when you look at a GDP outlook and what would naturally transpire in terms of electronics growth, there is presumably, we hope, either not the same set of constraints imposed on the industry from a supply point of view like, for example, the hard disk drive constraints in the first part of this year in 2013 and clearly, with life cycle extensions in the PC and kind of a consumer environment that hopefully is somewhat similar next year. There are a number of PC messages that frankly can be quite positive, and the 22-nanometer production is kind of ramping and the 14-nanometer tool-buy [ph] starts by the end of the year, kind of ramping through next year and we see that typically as a transition that would drive WFE in the microprocessor space.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then I guess, for my follow up, I would just ask a slightly more directed question toward the Foundry. Your biggest Foundry customer commented about weakness in their Q4 and Q1 utilization rate. So does it -- do you share any concerns in that segment due to your biggest customer's comments there?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I think consistent with our comments previously, our customers do a really good job and as time passes, an even better job managing the equipment purchasing decisions to minimize the risk that you've just described. And so there's clearly always a risk profile, but I think as well as there being commentary from a foundry, there's also commentary from the fabless companies and the fabless companies, the QUALCOMMs, the [indiscernible] of this world, for example, are commenting to no slowdown in 20-nanometer demands, 28-nanometer design wins continuing ramp occur [ph] the 28 nanometers expected demand has not slowed. So again, I guess it depends on your perspective. If you're all over the short term, it's probably a different kind of message, but in the long term, there's always this macroeconomic thing that everybody's going to hang their hat on because none of us know the answer to that question. But the basics and the fundamentals, I think, are actually quite favorable.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Ernie, I wanted to get an idea of the linearity of the delayed Novellus revenue we should expect over the next few quarters.","Ernest E. Maddock","I would expect that most of the linearity issues that we highlighted today will be worked through by the time we provide our December quarter guidance, so we really had a June issue, we had a September issue, which we've quantified as we discussed. And based on our current view, by December, we will be back to a more normalized pace for the combined company.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then I also wanted just to get your thoughts on additional costs that may not be captured in a non-GAAP basis associated with the integration of the 2 companies. And what this might mean to your overall operating margins structure for the, say, the next 6 months?","Ernest E. Maddock","Clearly, the June quarter had embedded within it several things that I would consider more one-time than not, things like banker fees, as well as some specific stock compensation issues related to the acquisition itself. I think on a more ongoing basis, you are likely to see somewhere in the range of $5 million to $10 million a quarter for specific integration related costs perhaps for the next couple of quarters and then diminishing from that point forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","First, just a kind of forward question on the foundry side. Since you guys haven't changed your view there, have you seen any changes in terms of your customer and mix on the foundry side? In other words, have you seen more broadening to smaller foundry customer or is this still really concentrated?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, there aren't many foundries in the world, so it's hard to kind of like step away and start declaring broadening. There's a little bit of movement, but I wouldn't speak to a particular message with any conviction. So there's a few guys participating. You know who they are and they're all participating at some level.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then maybe a question on your product. I think on your [indiscernible] you talked about and you guys have recently talked about single wafer clean and you're developing this next generation product to kind of expand opportunity there. I was wondering, any concerns, it takes time to develop a product and sometimes product, product timing, this certain customer mill [ph] cycle. You might take a few years before you start to see kind of the growth there. Any kind of concern that the timing of the development maybe a little bit late for the current 20-nanometer cycle and that you might run the risk of maybe not gaining the share that you are targeting?","Martin B. Anstice","I think it's a very good question and clearly, we're paying a lot of attention to doing everything we can to synchronize timing of product releases to the decisions of our customers. We have a huge amount of energy invested in that particular issue. I would say, if there's ever a segment of our business of our company where the risk profile is lowest is being Clean and the reason and that's true is because Clean is a yield-enhancing investment by the customer. It's not a feature-creating investment for the customer. And so even in a scenario where you didn't synchronize necessarily a new product to a DTOR decision or a first phase PTOR decision, Clean is one of the segments where if you can demonstrate value to the customer in terms of yield solutions in excess of a previously selected equipment set, then you have a much better chance of establishing co-PTOR positions and ultimately displacing a competition in a buy. If there's ever a place in the business where you feel better around the risk you've just spoken to, Clean is definitely the second.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Martin, in terms of the foundries and the transition from 28 to 20 nanometers, do you see this continued buildup that you mentioned about 28 potentially pushing out the adoption and I guess the ramp of 20 nanometers?","Martin B. Anstice","Really hard to tell. I mean, I don't think -- I mean, frankly, what's the biggest influence over that? The biggest influence is the design decisions of the customers, of the foundries. Everything that we've been able to kind of analyze would cause us to conclude what we're concluding relative to the 300,000 wafer starts message for 28-nanometer. I think at least one other equipment company has messaged something very similar recently. And I think the foundry public announcements have tended to talk about 28-nanometer spending in '13 and the 20-nanometer beginning to production ramp in '13, but primarily in '14. So it kind of hangs together as best we can tell. That all being said, clearly, every semiconductor company in the world is motivated to achieve lowest-cost unit output, and if a 20-nanometer solution achieves that, that may be their motivation. But again, I'd put that in context of the WFE message that I shared in an earlier question. The cost consequence of 10,000 wafer start addition of 20 nanometers is in the range of 30% to 40% more expensive than 28. So it's not an easy trade-off. I mean, it's definitely stressing what has been a fairly kind of simple set of decisions historically.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. Maybe moving to some of the announcements recently by your peers, as well as Intel, in terms of the 450 in EUV investments with ASML. How does that announcement potentially change your outlook for fourth [indiscernible] and the investments you need to make that program?","Martin B. Anstice","There is a joke that I could respond with, but I'm going to control myself.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Please tell the joke.","Martin B. Anstice","I would say the fundamentals of thinking through preparing our company to participate in 450 are exactly the same today as they were previously. I think high-volume manufacturing -- it still seems to be in the 2017, '18 timeframe. There are potentially -- is a higher probability today of a more broader equipment profile being available in a pilot line environment earlier, but frankly, that doesn't impact the plans of our company in a very meaningful way. We were invested in preparing to support customers in pilot line transitions that begin potentially with the G450 transition and then other pilot lines that have followed in the industry and that's our focus. So I don't know that it really changes anything fundamentally to the existing plans that are like what [ph] we have in our company.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A follow-up question on the September shipment guidance. Can you share any color on Lam's standalone or Novellus' standalone shipment guidance? Are both segments being kind of similar shipment declines in the near term?","Ernest E. Maddock","Stephen, this is Ernie. I would say that's a reasonable conclusion to draw. So perhaps the Novellus product's down margin-- well, actually, it's pretty equivalent, so it's -- I would say they're both impacted similarly.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up question, Ernie. Can you elaborate what you meant by a step-function decrease in OpEx in the middle of next year? is that related to possible product rationalization or is it something else?","Ernest E. Maddock","I think the comments were specifically related to the realization of our synergy targets. And I think as we have talked about now, we have a very large systems integration project that is currently scheduled to be concluded about the middle of 2013. And certainly, relative to realizing synergies in the IT world, synergies in certain support functions like finance, where having a common, general ledger, a common ERP system, makes things much more simple and as a result of that, enables us to drive a very significant step-function reduction relative to those synergy targets. So it is important to keep in mind that the statements relate to the achievement of that synergy run rate.","Martin B. Anstice","A nice simple example, going from 2 SAP systems to 1.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I don't know if this question's for Martin or Ernie. The $100 million synergy that you mentioned was between COGS and OpEx, what is the baseline COGS number and what is the baseline OpEx you're using?","Ernest E. Maddock","The targets, Krish, were prepared in the context of the information presented in the proxy. And so that would be a baseline, so it's 2013 view, which actually includes that 2013 view of wafer fab and associated revenues. I think I've mentioned before that there is a relatively modest OpEx increase for Lam forecasted in there, a bit more significant OpEx increase for Novellus. But I think it's important at this point to understand that those estimates are now many, many months old and what will become relevant which we'll be sharing here in the November timeframe will be our view for 2013. That's going to be derived in a timeframe that is much more relevant to the actuality of '13 than existed at the time we put the proxy together.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, all right. And then as a follow-up, when you look at your 450-millimeter investments coming down the road, what order of magnitude should we think about given that you have multiple product lines? And does it really make sense to migrate all your products to 450 or would you mind dropping some of the lower market share ones like the PVD at Novellus?","Martin B. Anstice","I am going to specifically decline to answer most of that question for reasons that I hope are obvious to everybody. A big part of value proposition is competitive differentiation, which if you tell everybody what you're doing, you kind of tend to lose. We are clearly encumbered as is every equipment company with a complex set of trade-offs. It is not obvious that walking away from 300-millimeter positions because you have imperfect market share is the right answer to questions. It is not obvious how any of us can kind of parallel process multiple nodes, 300-millimeter investments with 450 and one of the dynamics that exists for the entire industry in a 450-millimeter transition is different than 300 is we don't have everybody talking about it all at the same time. And so rather than just kind of shoot from the hip, which is what we would be doing, at this point in the process, we have an analyst meeting scheduled for November and we'll take an action to give as much color as we can on this particular point without compromising the competitive position of the company.","Shanye Hudson","And operator, we have time for 2 more quick questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Pang.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","On your 2013 assumption for wafer fab equipment spending, is there a difference in the relative growth rate of the etch, 2012 to 2013 versus the products that you picked up from Novellus?","Martin B. Anstice","In terms of the market size, I would say no. I think the types of things that are positive to the etch business in terms of 3D transitions, materials transitions, high-k metal gate transitions and patenting are relevant in the Novellus products as much as they are in etch and Clean for Lam. The one thing that is slightly different is, in relative terms, the Lam position in the areas that are impacted is relatively stronger than the Novellus position. But obviously, that's something we're working hard to address.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. My follow up is, you talked a little bit about the market share not changing too much. What's your expectation for your ending market share for the wet clean.","Martin B. Anstice","Ending as they are higher [ph] or...","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Ending this year. Ending 2012.","Martin B. Anstice","I think we'll be -- we said we're in kind of in the mid-20s level, frankly, as an approximate area for market share and it's a pretty neutral year for us. I would expect to the question that was raised a little earlier, the market share momentum in the company against the 5 to 10 percentage points of share that we're targeting over 3 to 5 years to begin the kick in next year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I'm just -- I'm curious a little bit given the large increase in double patterning steps that we expect that 20 nanometer at the foundries [ph], why you're not more bullish on the opportunity for etched to maybe outperform or grow faster than fab equipment in general, can you explain that?","Martin B. Anstice","Well, I -- as is always true, there's a lot of complexity to answering simple questions. And one of the things that we're very convicted on is that when you look at these transitions, the process time consequences to etch and clean and deposition are quite significant, right? And we've talked about in the 3D transition, generally a 5% to 15% process time increase and in the 28 to 20 foundry transition, we've talked about a meaningful 15% to 25% process time increase for the S [ph] segments. The challenge is, how are everybody else's process times changing and while we have a really good knowledge about our business, we don't really have good knowledge about everybody else's business, number one. Number two, the ultimate consequence of all of this is defined on an income statement and what shows up on an income statement isn't process time, what shows up on an income statement is the sum of the invoices that you get paid by customers for, and so relative pricing roadmaps of customers and how that ultimately plays out is important. And so very, very simple message. We are very convicted about delivering a message that there's some positives in segments that we will benefit from in these transitions. And it's our job to make sure that we position that value very well at the customer and then we get paid for it fairly and then just kind of what that turned out to be and how it plays out as a function about what we do, what our customers do and those of our peer group as well, complicated math.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good, very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, clarification on the Novellus contribution that was not recognized in terms of revenue. Was that $37 million in fiscal Q4 that was not recognized?","Ernest E. Maddock","No, the $37 million actually represents the totality of revenue that Novellus have previously recorded. There are 2 impacts for the quarter. The first is the part of that revenue that would have been recognized, the second relates to the revenue recognition policy change and so I would estimate the totality of that for the quarter to be more in the range of $60 million to $65 million from a top line perspective.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then $100 million next quarter and then winding down by December?","Ernest E. Maddock","That's correct.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And did you say that there are associated costs with that, that you will break out for us each quarter?","Ernest E. Maddock","Well, we're certainly going to reconcile between GAAP and non-GAAP results, the differences in the inventory values. So that is what allowed us to make commentary that relative to the guidance that we provided earlier, were it not for this change, you'd have an improvement in margins by about a percentage point and the result in TPS [ph] impact from about a quarter.","Operator","And I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Shanye Hudson","Wonderful.

Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the September 2019 quarter and our outlook for the December 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon.

A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","With that, let me hand the call over to Tim.","Tim Archer","Thanks, Tina, and welcome everyone. In the September quarter, Lam delivered solid results. Our continued execution to commitments, combined with our guidance for the December quarter increases our conviction that Lam is in a strong position to outperform as wafer fabrication equipment spending inflects higher. Doug will cover the financial results in more detail shortly, but I\u2019m especially pleased with the demonstrated earnings power of the Company. At the midpoint of our December guide, calendar year 2019 diluted earnings per share will be the second highest in our history despite the current industry cycle.","I would like to take this opportunity to thank our customers and partners for their continued support of Lam and our employees throughout the world for their contributions to these results. From an industry perspective, we have revised upward our view on 2019 WFE to the mid $40 billion range versus our prior estimate of down mid-to-high teens percentage year on year, which implied a low $40 billion level of spending.","We are beginning to see improvement in the memory market, led first by NAND. NAND\u2019s demand dynamics are improving and oversupply conditions should continue to abate as we move through the December quarter. We expect to exit 2019 with a bit supply growth rate for NAND of approximately 30%, which is well below our view on long-term demand; and as a result, NAND inventories are expected to decline to normalized levels in the first half of calendar 2020.","While the timing of the memory equipment spending recovery is always hard to predict, we are encouraged that customers continue to manage supply growth even as we are starting to see favorable end-market demand indicators. This is a sign of a healthy industry and a good setup for increased NAND spending in 2020. On the DRAM front, inventories have remain elevated, and we do not expect them to reach normalized levels until the second half of 2020.","However, we see positive demand catalyst ahead in both the server and smartphone markets. Our server CPU upgrade cycle is expected to begin next year with increased adoption of new generation platforms from leading manufacturers. For smartphones, major vendors are planning to launch additional 5G models which is expected to drive content growth for the overall smartphone market in 2020.","Turning to foundry and logic, spending in this segment has been strong throughout 2019 and based on recent customer commentary, looks to remain so heading into next year. Diverse end market applications are driving higher levels of foundry and logic spending, moreover, challenges in scaling functional block such as SRAM and logic devices are leading to increases in die sizes and these in turn are accelerating changes in device architectures and chip manufacturing technologies.","Lam's growing position with key foundry and logic customers has positioned us to incrementally benefit from these secular trends. Competitively, we are executing at a high level. Based on the midpoint of our December guidance, Lam's 2019 foundry and logic revenues are set to significantly outgrow announced customer CapEx plans. The share gains we are now seeing in the foundry and logic segment are the result of close customer collaboration and strong product execution over many years and multiple technology transitions. They are evidence of the benefit of sustained investment in R&D throughout industry cycles.","Looking at the market as a whole including memory, foundry, and logic, we are on track in 2019 to deliver our best ever penetration and defense performance, as measured by net forward-looking, three-year revenue opportunity for application decisions made in this calendar year. A key contributor to our strong penetration and defense performance has been continued focus on technologies that enable 3D device architectures, which are becoming increasingly important to performance and cost scaling across all market segments.","We invested early in 2D to 3D inflections; and as these transitions are occurring, we are seeing expansion in both our SAM and market share. Etch and deposition processes are critical enablers for 3D scaling, and we are investing aggressively to deliver the technology and productivity innovation required to satisfy customer roadmaps. As evidenced by our penetration and defense wins this year, we believe we are extending Lam's leadership in this space.","In 3D NAND, we're successfully defended 100% of our memory whole dielectric etch positions and continue to be the supplier for this application at all 3D NAND manufacturers. We are also winning 3D NAND applications where productivity is the primary point of differentiation. Notably, Lam has been the first to deliver production proven edge-yield solutions for etch. In this quarter, we used our Corvus tunable edge hardware on our flex dielectric etch system to improve profile tilt uniformity and win an important productivity sensitive slit etch application.","On the conductor etch front, we won a 3D NAND application for a new vertical architecture that reduces die size and is a technical solution for lowering bit cost. In deposition, we recorded an important 3D NAND win for the VECTOR DT, which deposits backside films to control stress as layer counts increase. Another significant deposition win was for our Striker ALD tool used to deposit high quality liners and gapfill as aspect ratios get higher.","We also continue to extend our 3D expertise and position outside of the 3D NAND space, including in rapidly growing markets such as advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration. Over the last three years, the installed base for our SABRE 3D electroplating system has grown by more than 70%, and we are the leading electroplating supplier for TSV, for DRAM, CMOS image sensor, and logic devices.","Our SABRE 3D electroplating solutions embed best-in-class technology backed by years of high-volume production experience. With each successive win across our served markets, the installed base of Lam equipment continues to grow, resulting in an expanding long-term revenue opportunity for our customer support business.","To create value for customers over the entire lifecycle of tool ownership, we are actively developing upgrades and advanced services targeted at extending technical capability and increasing productivity from existing installed base assets. These offerings help our customers reduce their total cost; and as a result, we continue to see growing demand.","Revenues from our customer support business grew in the September quarter on a sequential basis and our Reliant business achieved record quarterly revenue for the third quarter in a row. We expect 2019 overall will be another growth year for our customer support business.","Looking at our year-to-date performance, we have made tremendous progress against our objectives of expanding our SAM, increasing our market share, and building our installed base business. Importantly, 2019 has been a year where Lam has strengthened its position in the foundry and logic segment.","Also, with early indications of improving NAND demand and positive catalyst on the horizon for DRAM, we are increasingly optimistic the calendar year 2020 is setting up to be a year of outperformance for Lam as spending mix moves back in our favor.","Thanks again for joining today and now here's Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Okay, great. Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings season. We're pleased with Lam's performance in the September quarter. Our results once again exceeded the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics. Operating income and diluted earnings per share came in at the high-end of our guidance range as we remain prudent in managing our spending throughout the quarter.","Let me begin as I always do by talking about our revenue segmentation in the September quarter. The combined memory segment was flat with the June quarter at 64% of total systems revenue. We had a decrease in the September quarter in the nonvolatile memory segment, moving from 46% to 38%, while DRAM increased from 26% from 18% of assistant revenue.","Spending in the NAND segment was focused on multiple nodes and we're beginning to see the first ramp of 128 layer structures. On the DRAM side, apart from the 1x and 1y nodes, we're seeing initial investments at 1z. As I noted on our last quarter earnings call, foundry and logic spending was strong and we expect strength from this segment to continue to the remainder of the calendar year.","The foundry segment represented 25% of our systems revenue in the quarter. Strength in this segment is related to spending on the 7 and 5 nanometer nodes. Logic another segment was down slightly from the prior quarter level coming in at 11% of system revenue. We continue to demonstrate strong progress in the foundry and logic segments, enabling us to maintain solid profitability levels during a period of depressed memory spending.","I believe probably foundry logic spending will be even stronger in December. Revenues for the quarter came in at $2,166 million which was again above the midpoint of guidance. Our revenue had a slightly broader geographic mix in the September quarter, compared to the June quarter. Our top reasons continue to be China, Korea and Taiwan.","The China region quarter performance remains higher than our historic average concentration of revenue. And similar to what I talked about last quarter, the majority of this came from indigenous Chinese customers across multiple segments.","Gross margin came in at 45.4% which was 40 basis points above the midpoint, mainly due to customer mix. And as we stated in prior quarters, you should expect gross margins to be a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, and we expect to see variability quarter to quarter.","We continued manager spending levels in the Company as operating expenses in the September quarter declined to $431 million which was down from $450 million in previous quarter. We remain laser focused on investing in research and development programs, as we saw the percentage of spending and R&D increased quarter-over-quarter to 67% of operating expenses.","The December quarter the guidance reflects total spending, increasing back to the June level, primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense. A variable compensation fluctuates based on the level of quarterly profitability.","I'm going to also remind you that as we look ahead to the 2020 calendar year, you will see the normal seasonal spending increases related to the March quarter, comes from things like payroll taxes.","Operating income in the September quarter was $552 million and operating margin was 25.5%, at the top of our guidance range. Our September quarter non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 11% which was slightly lower than our long term rate. There will be fluctuations in the rate from quarter to quarter and we now expect our long term rate to be in the low teens level.","Other income and expense was a total of approximately $11 million in expense in the September quarter. The main components of other income and expense our interest income from the cash and investment balances we hold, offset by expense related to our outstanding debt. The total interest expense and all tranches of our debt is right now about $41 million per quarter.","You should expect that other income and expense will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, based on several market related items such as; our deferred compensation assets, venture capital investments and foreign exchange. We continue to execute on our capital return program during the September quarter. We allocated $234 million to capital return in the quarter with $75 million related to open market share repurchases and $159 million in dividends.","I would like to remind you that we continue to have an ongoing structured repurchase program that is expected to mature in the December quarter. This will continue to reduce our share count. We remain on track with our committed capital return. We currently have approximately $3 billion remaining in our Board authorized share repurchase program.","Diluted earnings per share came in at $3.18, which was at the high end of the guidance range that we provided for September. We ended the September quarter with diluted shares for earnings per share at approximately 151 million shares, which is the seventh consecutive quarter where our diluted share count has declined. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. And I'll remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.","Let me now switch to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased slightly in the September quarter to $5.8 billion from $5.7 billion in the June quarter. Cash flows from operations were $464 million, which was offset by share repurchase and dividends. Year-to-date in calendar year 2019, we have had strong cash from operations performance and we're on track to end this year with the second highest level of free cash flows in the Company's history.","DSO increased to 69 days versus 56 in the prior quarter. The DSO increase is related to the timing of customer payments occurring at the end of the September calendar month, which falls within our December fiscal quarter. Our inventory balance declined sequentially by $57 million, which is the fifth consecutive quarter where inventory balance decline. Inventory turns were 3.2 turns, which was just a little bit less than the 3.3 turns that we saw in the June quarter.","Non-cash expenses included approximately $43 million for equity compensation, $49 million for depreciation and $16 million for amortization. September quarter capital expenditures came in at $39 million, which was a decrease from $66 million in the June quarter. Our September quarter-end headcount was flat with the prior quarter at approximately 10,700 regular full-time employees.","So now looking ahead I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2019 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2,500 million, plus or minus $150 million. Gross margin of 45% plus or minus 1 percentage point, operating margins of 27% plus or minus 1 percentage point.","And finally, earnings per share of $3.80 plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 150 million shares. I'm pleased to share with you the results we've delivered throughout calendar year 2019 and what has been a challenging industry environment. As Tim noted the supply demand environment is improving for the memory segments and we've made good progress in our foundry and logic positioning. Our installed base business continues to be on track to deliver a growth year in 2019. We're well positioned heading into 2020 and are optimistic about our future performance going forward.","Finally, I'd like to announce our plans to host an Investor Day on March 3rd, 2020 in New York City. Details on the venue and precise time will be forthcoming.","Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik","Question on the WFE, Tim, you mentioned WFE going from low $40 billion to mid $40 billion. I wanted to understand if the majority of the increase has come from the foundry\/logic segment in terms of the revised outlook?","Tim Archer","Maybe a few modifications, I mean, clearly, as we've said, we've continued to see strengthening in foundry and logic. So that is a portion of it. The -- some very early indications of NAND spending increase as we have now guided for December quarter. And finally, continuing strengthening in the China WFE as we've, kind of, seen increased strength throughout the year. So a combination of all those things, lead to our upward revision in WFE.","Atif Malik","Okay. And then a follow-up in your prepared remarks, you mentioned foundry\/logic share gains above foundry\/logic CapEx this year. How should we think about the outperformance of your foundry\/logic business into next year and out given there\u2019s some of the elements like reuse and growing EUV steps?","Tim Archer","Well, that's a great question, we basically -- as we have said on a number of occasions, the intensity of etch and deposition we see continuing to increase at every technology node. Our SAM grows, whether it'd be 10 to seven to five to three on into the future. SAM increases even in the face of EUV increased usage. And there's a number of reasons for that; patterning complexity continues to increase regardless of the introduction of EUV, and so there are additional steps for deposition and etch.","EUV itself introduces new requirements for hardmask, which gives Lam opportunity to participate from a deposition perspective. And EUV also, we have talked about in the past introduces opportunities for new steps like and processes like atomic layer etching that can be used to help increase quality and productivity of the EUV pattern itself. So, I think the way you should think about it is our SAM is expanding, competitively our -- we're gaining share at some of these new layers, and we feel we're well setup in both the foundry and logic space going forward as technology transitions.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","Yes. Good afternoon thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, if we look back through to 2018, it looks like your share of wallet for WFE with NAND is roughly 30%. So curious as you think about moving to a rising layer count and your leadership in the high aspect ratio etch, and the just announced deposition wins on the call tonight, how should we think about your share of wallet as we go to 128 layer and above into 2020?","Tim Archer","Our SAM as a percentage of customer spend continues to increase with layer count, and that's for two reasons; one, I mean obviously the simple fact of building and etching the higher stack, but also the fact that, as I mentioned there are new steps and new opportunities that get created for dealing with issues such as; in the VECTOR DT case the stress associated with those taller layer counts. So, I think that our view is SAM grows as layer count increases.","C.J. Muse","Thanks, Tim. And I guess as a follow up, Doug, I'm not sure if you spoke to the entirety of installed base revenues, but did they grow sequentially in September? And how should we think about the trend? Or what should we kind of model it to into 2020?","Doug Bettinger","Yes. C.J., I think, Tim, actually mentioned in his prepared remarks that they did grow sequentially and it was the third consecutive record quarter for the Reliant component of that business. I'm not going to quantify next year yet, a little bit too soon. But what we said in the past and I can continue to be very comfortable saying today is, I have a hard time envisioning a year when the installed base business doesn't grow, it should grow every single year because chamber count grows every year, it's growing this year, even in a depressed memory spending environment, and we continue to bring new advanced service offerings to market that we hope enable us to achieve more and more of the customer's OpEx spend. So that's how you should be thinking about that C.J.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","This is the second quarter in a row of the heavier China domestic mix. Do you guys anticipate this bias to continue into the December quarter and into next year and similar to my question last time? Is this in your view a focused effort by China to accelerate their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, given the trade tensions with the U.S. or more your China customers just having more confidence to move forward with their early memory and foundry programs?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Harlan, what I\u2019ve tried to describe in fact, I tried to foreshadow it last quarter in earnings that this is above normal run rate of local Chinese customers spend. But Tim did point out in his remarks that some of the strengthening in WFE came from local China, probably now and nominally somewhat about $6 billion in WFE. And as we look into next year, we absolutely think it will grow again next year, but it will ebb and flow, it will -- these big projects can be lumpy at times, and it will go up and it will go down depending on when equipment ships into any one fab project. Tim, do you want to add anything?","Tim Archer","Yes, I think that -- as I commented, we've seen strengthening in domestic China spend through the year, anticipate that continuing and maybe the most important part of that story for Lam is that clearly a big portion of the new incremental spending in China is targeted toward the memory market. And obviously our SAM, and our share in the memory space is quite good, so from that perspective we see China as an area of strength for us.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Harlan, I forgot the one part of your question you asked, do we think anything pulled in? Actually really don't, I don't think it would make sense that they would be pulling things in sooner and because if you're concerned about our inability to ship being the reason they pulled in, then they can get spares and service from us, they can't actually really utilize the tools very well. So I don't believe that there was pull-ons really do anything like that.","Harlan Sur","Great, thank you. Thank you for the insights there. And the team continues its strong design win momentum on non-critical and\/or legacy technology node. As part of it, as you pointed out is the Reliant systems products continue to do well. We continue to hear from your customers that they're laser focused on productivity throughput, uptime, footprint all of the things that impact overall wafer costs. Are you guys now in a position to at least give us some sense on how fast the non-critical\/refurbished business systems -- business is growing? And roughly the size of this business relative to your total revenue base?","Tim Archer","Maybe you have to wait till Investor Day for that. No, we do plan -- we do -- we have promised for some time now to provide you more detail in those areas and we're just, we will do that. I think maybe a couple of points, your comment about customers being laser focused on productivity? I mean, it's one of the reasons why we have been talking about it, it takes some time for those products for our efforts to really start to show up in new wins.","But you know we're starting to see in this area that Doug talked about in advanced services, where some of these intelligent database tools are really starting to help us reduce, for instance troubleshooting time on the systems, reduced unscheduled downs on the systems and those are things that the customers are pulling hard for because again it's productivity for tools that are already in place and relatively easy to implement. So we are prioritizing productivity, because it's in the best interest of the customer and the industry as a whole.","Operator","Thank you. We'll hear now from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks, let me ask the question. Congratulations on the strong results. Tim, I just want to go back to the market opportunity in logic\/foundry for you. If you kind of look at calendar year-to-date that business combined for you was up somewhere between 30% to 40% year-over-year? I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of how we think about your market position, maybe in North America as we see 14 go to 10 go to seven and maybe in Taiwan as we see seven go to five go to three, can you talk a little bit about how much visibility you have on product tool of record on some of these critical etch and deposition steps? And how we might think about your share opportunity as we migrate down these nodes?","Tim Archer","Sure, I can do that without quite getting as specific as North America, Taiwan on those notes. So maybe I'll point you just a couple of comments, I made and then embellish there was a little bit, you know, as I said it within the logic and foundry space, it takes many years to establish yourself as the first -- the development tool of record. And then ultimately see that rollout into volume buys is the production tool of record.","And so when we talk about I gave -- we gave a little bit of a new look into this penetration and defense. Forward-looking three-year revenue opportunity statement, that is designed to give some indication as to how long it takes from the time we win one of those selection decisions and you'll see that revenue opportunity will take place over those following three years, that's definitely true in the foundry and logic space.","And so I think that when we talk about improving opportunity at 10 and then seven and then five, you know, you can kind of look out and say, if you're like a 5-nanometer decision is revenue opportunities that now we're roll in over the course of the next several years. So that may not be quite the level of specificity you wanted, but it basically says things that we are winning now will actually be our revenue for the next three years plus in that space.","John Pitzer","That's helpful. And then, Doug, you mentioned in your prepared comments, you still have about $3 billion left on the buyback, and I apologize in capital allocation call, but this most recent quarter, the buybacks dipped down a little bit, which I guess is understandable, just given the level of uncertainty. Any color you can give us around the pace at which you might want to try to execute buybacks going forward? And how we should think about, kind of, just remind us again the cash return policy you're trying to hit?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, John, I mean, one thing I would point out to you and if you look over the last two years, you will have seen several quarters where the cash we actually deployed moved down somewhat. That was because in the quarter before that we put one of these accelerated share repurchase programs in place. You have the same phenomenon going on this quarter.","So even though the cash that we deployed in terms of open market repurchases wasn't all that significant this quarter, that ASR was still executing buying stock back, and that ASR that's currently out there will complete in the December quarter. So we'll be thinking about what we're going to do incrementally as we go forward.","So far, just remind you what we talked about and it's been a while now the last Analyst Day that we're committed to at least 50% of free cash flow returned to shareholders, and obviously if you look at our history, over the last five, six years, we've done a whole lot more than that. And I had went on the timing to complete the current authorization and I'm going to kind of remain that way. I've said in the past, we'll be opportunistic and that's as much as I have quite right now.","Operator","Thank you, we'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot. I guess my first question, Doug is can you help us a little bit with the mix in December. I'm curious, if the uptick in revenue is going to be more on the NAND side and more on the foundry side? Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, what I said, Tim in my remarks, was I expect December will continue to be pretty strong with foundry and logic quarter. So that's a key piece of what's going on.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, awesome. And then I just wanted to -- I just wanted to drill down a little bit into the China piece. So China is about 25% of your revenues now on the trailing 12-month basis. So I guess, I'm curious how much of this is going into indigenous projects versus the multinationals. Because I thought you said China was about $5 billion of 2018 WFE, and I think at that time, you were talking about $3 billion of that $5 billion being domestic China. And I think you just said that China is going to be over $6 this year. So, can you sort of like level set us on how much of that $6 this year will be multi-versus domestic and maybe how much domestic can even grow next year? Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, let me walk it back for you a little, Tim, because some things have moved around a little bit. When I look at what happened last year, local China ended up being I don't know $4.5 billion of WFE roughly. So it ended up being maybe a little bit more than that for that we have been talking about and the way we see it today, it's above $6, it's somewhat above $6. I don't know for sure what next year is going to look like. But as we look at our analytics in the fab projects that are coming in and whatnot, I do see pretty strongly believe it will grow next year. I'm not ready to tell you how much yet. We'll give you more clarity on our WFE view for next year on the next earnings call. But I think local China will continue to grow next year.","Timothy Arcuri","And, Doug just to clarify those numbers are local China numbers right?","Doug Bettinger","That's right, Tim. Yes.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take the next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Yes. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Tim, you talked about early signs of a recovery in NAND in your prepared remarks. And Doug, you just mentioned that most of the growth or at least implicitly, I think you commented that most of the growth in December quarter should be coming from foundry and logic? So should we expect some of the NAND projects that we're all collectively hearing about should hit the March quarter from a rev rec perspective?","Tim Archer","Yes, it's maybe there is not such a big change here from what we've said. We -- you know, ever since beginning of the year, we said that memory spending would likely remain relatively weak throughout the year. And when I talked about early signs, it is the -- it's very early is in there, we're now starting to see some of those projects transpire as you just talked about, meaning a little bit of ordering occurring in the December quarter, but we still maintain our view that we exit the year with this 30% bit supply growth rate and that customers are prudently managing the supply growth, but I do think those projects, you know, it's kind of that early signs, it's a healthy industry and we're going to see growth in 2020. So exact timing, we really don't want to give you that right now, but it's -- it looks to be coming.","Toshiya Hari","Got it. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to hit the logic and foundry opportunity dynamic into 2020. Obviously, you guys have done a great job over the past couple of years and gaining share in both buckets. If we assume that spending in logic and foundry is largely flat in 2020, and if you assume EUV adoption continues to grow. Based on what you guys know from a design win or application win perspective, can you still grow logic and foundry revenues in that sort of environment backdrop? Thanks.","Tim Archer","Yes, it's a great question and the answer is yes, we would expect to grow in that scenario, based on a couple of things; one, as you move forward, even on the same WFE, our SAM as a percent of that WFE should increase as transition still continued to occur to more advanced nodes. Etch and deposition opportunity increases at each successive technology node, even in the face of EUV. So I think in the scenario described, we would expect to have a larger opportunity and we do believe that we're winning share as well and therefore we would grow.","Operator","Thank you. We'll hear now from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.","Krish Sankar","Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them; first one for either Tim or Doug. More a industry focused question you spoke about how NAND bit growth exiting this year is going to be 30%, kind of, curious like ask your customers start ramping 128 layer NAND, if next year demand bit growth is below 30%. Do you still expect the 120 layers spending to go through next year, because it's more strategic, low cost in nature? Or do you think it might get throttle back if demand bit growth is slower?","Doug Bettinger","Maybe I'll take and then Tim you can add-on. I mean, Krish what -- one I don't think that's what's going to happen. But we're that to be what happened, I think you would see a year that looked something like this year in that most of the industry spending was allocated to node conversions as opposed to new capacity adds, because that lowers cost per bit, the economics are better and all of that.","The other thing I would say, and then I'll let Tim add-on. When we look into early next year, I believe supply growth rate will continue to decline based on the investment set have occurred this year, right? Because they have reduced this year and so you're moving into a declining rate of growth, as we look into the first half of next year. Tim, anything you want to add?","Tim Archer","Yes, I think just to reiterate Doug's point, I mean, technology transitions we think occur every year, simply because of the benefit to bit cost. And so, I guess, I would say that in any year, which is not our view of declining supply growth we would still see the majority of the spend in technology transitions. And I guess there is one other key point to think about, we've mentioned this a few times in a technology transition from say 96 layers to 128 layers, the majority of that spend is for etch and deposition. So there's definitely an outperformance statement there, if spend continues to be based just on technology transitions.","Krish Sankar","Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, I think, Tim in your prepared comments you spoke about how you guys are successfully defended 100% dielectric etch market share. I'm kind of curious on the NAND side, is that a fair enough statement, if you look past 128 layer higher than 128 layer DTOR tools or is it more up to 128 layers?","Tim Archer","Well, in our statement is always as those decisions are made. So we always speak about accomplishing made. So I don't know if any decisions have been made well beyond the 128 layer node. So we -- it's obviously something that we compete for it every node. But, I guess what I'd point out is there is a very important piece of learning that has come from us running now millions of wafers through our dielectric etch tools.","And there was a question earlier about, productivity, reliability, stability, defect performance. Those are all things that again we have millions and millions of wafers of experience. And so kind of come in with an edge every node that you have to compete for as the incumbent. So that -- but specifically, I think, you could bucket most of those in that 128 nanometer and below node since their decisions already made.","Operator","Thank you. We'll hear from Patrick Ho with Stifel.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. And also congrats on a really nice quarter, maybe, Tim, first, a lot of the market questions have been answered on my end. But as you look at next generation memory technologies like MRAM, ReRAM. Can you just give a -- maybe a qualitative view of how Lam is positioning itself to capitalize on those next generation opportunities?","Tim Archer","Yes, I guess maybe the simpler statement that I make inside the Company is we're not running from our leadership position in memory, and that includes in these new emerging memory markets. And so we're actively looking to develop new applications, new tools that meet the needs of those devices. We've spoken about, one of them in particular so far this year, which is the ion beam edge tool, that's used for MRAM and we have established a very strong position for that particular application, phase-change memory ReRAM, there are other devices we are actively engaged in development with the leading companies. So it is a target market for us, in fact, one might argue that we feel we, sort of, we already sort of own that memory space and I think it's our focus.","Doug Bettinger","It's Dough. Just to add-on, if you really want more detail you can go look at the transcript of the Flash Memory Summit, where Tim and Rick Gottscho spent lots of time talking about how we view these emerging memory architectures.","Patrick Ho","Great. Thanks, Doug. And maybe as my follow-up question, you talked a little bit about your atomic layer deposition opportunity. I guess from a big picture perspective, how do you see the total available market for you in that? And do you see it expanding from where -- it looks like you have a strong position on the memory side of thing. Can this also expand onto the foundry\/logic side of things?","Tim Archer","So we'd already has expanded, I mean, ALD is not memory specific. So we use these films also on the logic and foundry side. ALD atomic layer etching and atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching, these are technologies that will continue to be increasingly used as devices become smaller and smaller and structures become more complex. So I think it's an expanding market opportunity, and in fact I think in coming years, you'll start to see inflections for instance from batch processing tools to single wafer ALD just again for the type of wafer uniformity and requirements of those processes going forward. So it's an area where we're growing and we feel confident about our development activities in the tools themselves.","Operator","Thank you. We'll hear now from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.","Craig Ellis","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I wanted to follow-up on the comments that you made that calendar '20 to be a year of outperformance for Lam. Can you just help us understand how much of that comes from moving deeper into the sweet spot of the foundry\/logic share gain that you've been talking about versus help that you would get from what appears to be a nice and very encouraging upturn that's starting to occur in NAND or maybe something else like SAM expansion?","Tim Archer","Yes, I think for us to give you more detail on the break out on that you'll have to wait until we actually speak to our 2020 WFE outlook next quarter. But you kind of hit it, I mean, we -- the way I think about outperformance in 2020, it's just what you said. First and foremost you -- everyone knows that we are highly leveraged to the memory market, and we do believe that spending mix moves back in our favor next year.","And even in the face of stronger and continuing strength in logic and foundry memory will improve to some extent. We've strengthened our logic and foundry SAM opportunity, as well as share position and so that's a continued benefit as logic and foundry remain strong. And also as Doug mentioned CSBG continues to grow as we expand our portfolio of advanced services in that space. And so can break it out for you, how much each of those contributes, but each of them is important part of the story in 2020.","Craig Ellis","Thanks, Tim. And then I'll do the follow-up to Doug. Doug impressive trough-to-trough operating margin improvement of about 300 basis points. And within that there is dramatic improvement with operating expense as a percentage of sales. And as you noted, there's been significant mix shift R&D. The question is how much further benefit is there in the model for increased operating leverage? And how much room do you have to further drive expense toward R&D from SG&A?","Doug Bettinger","It's something we've been working on for years, I mean, Tim was driving those on years ago, honestly in rest of companies rally behind it. We're going to keep squeeze in efficiency out every SG&A dollar we spend. We want to be totally rigorous about that. So that we can allocate more of those dollars to R&D, I think that 60%, 70% last quarter might be an all-time high for the Company. I haven't gone all the way back, but in my recent memory that was an all-time high. We're going to keep at that, we're going to continue to try to get better, we do this every words part of the culture of the Company to be focused on continuous improvement. I don't know how we can get it obviously, but we're going to keep working on it.","Operator","Thank you. We'll hear now from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. And I joined a little late, so I apologize if this was asked. But DRAM was quite strong in the quarter. And I'm wondering what caused that and how sustainable is that trend?","Tim Archer","When I look at it, it's primarily conversion spending. That's really what we've seen for the entire year is focused on node conversions, it will ebb and flow. The important thing when you think about DRAM is to understand when we look at similar to what we were describing NAND exiting the year below where we believe demand growth to be, you got a similar story in DRAM.","As we look at the investments that are occurring in DRAM this year exiting the year supply growth is probably in the low teens. And we believe long-term demand growth is in high teens maybe approaching 20%. There is a ways to go, Vivek to continue to burn inventory out of the channel. I think that's going to take a little bit longer. But what I do know is at some point the inventory will be burned off and spending will grow more significantly. In quarter-by-quarter, it's just going to be dependent on what projects are under way at what customers.","Vivek Arya","Got it, very helpful. And then as a follow-up, kind of, looking at your cash flow generation, so fiscal '19 from what I noticed there was a lot of cash inflow from working capital that I'm looking at the model right. How should we think about the plus and minus from working capital this year? Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","If you look at the first half of this year, Vivek -- calendar year again. I never really think too much in terms of fiscal calendar year. I mean we're -- cash was just super strong, I think we had two consecutive quarters around $900 million in operational cash flow and you're right. A lot of that came from working capital. Now what you normally see with the business when it's growing, it will consume working capital, meaning it will take cash to build inventory and receivables and so forth.","When it levels off or contracts, it will generate cash and that's really what went on in the first half of the year. I mean, we managed cash quite proactively, but the practical reality of business ebb and flow was that's what happens. The right way to think about the free cash flow of the business is it's a couple of points below where operational cash flow should be on a sustainable basis. But it will ebb and flow around wherever read in the business cycle.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo.","Joe Lachky","Yes, thanks for taking the question. You talked about improvements and inventory that you've seen across the NAND flash. I was wondering, if you could talk about, to the extent you can, factory utilization rates and your installed base?","Tim Archer","It's hard for us actually to put our finger on exactly what utilizations are. I mean we saw it pulled back a little bit in both NAND and DRAM this year. And I think that was pretty well-telegraphed from our customers. But better -- it's a better question to put to them, we don't always know exactly what their utilizations are running at.","Joe Lachky","Okay, fair enough. And then maybe a follow-up to that. You talked about exiting this year at 30% supply growth, I mean, for NAND and maybe and potentially going lower than that next year on the first part of the year. I guess, the question is how do we think about the level of capacity expansion needed to hit kind of the -- I guess, expected demand growth for 2020?","Doug Bettinger","Tough question to answer Joe, to be honest. What's occurred this year and NAND largely has been conversions, maybe with a couple exceptions. But if you look at NAND, WFE through the year -- this year, but that's what was going on and you saw declining rate of supply growth such that as we exit the year obviously, we said 30% and I think long-term NAND growth is in the high '30s, maybe 40%. To have 40% supply growth, we need to be adding a few wafers every single year, and so it didn't happen quite so much this year and you've seen supply growth decline. I don't know if that helps you, but that's how I think about it.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I really had two and most of them have been answered. But from a high level, I mean, do you guys talking about kind of a better market for memory in 2020. So when do you think we'll see capacity upgrades or is this all going to be technology upgrades?","And then secondly, you guys gave a lot of color on NAND, but not so much in DRAM. So based on the commentary about server demand and kind of an increase in Q1, does that mean you guys think that -- that's going to be kind of the bottom or do you think that exiting the year, we're going to start to see supply demand balance for DRAM?","Tim Archer","Well, I think that what we've said about DRAM maybe just was that we think through the first half of next year. Inventory remains elevated and so it's really not, I guess our view at this point is DRAM maybe more of a second half story for next year. Obviously we'll give far more color as we develop our full 2020 outlook. It's just that NAND is much more upon us right now. Simply because the issues are being worked through more quickly as a result of the supply constraints that have been in place this year and maybe also the demand catalysts for NAND that are occurring right now.","Mitch Steves","Got it. And is a capacity upgrades at what time in 2020 is that like back half or do you think capacity upgrades will begin earlier than that?","Doug Bettinger","Mitch too soon for us to talk in any detail about 2020, hold off for one quarter we'll give you a little better visibility on it. It's still a little bit too far away for us to get into detail.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Correia for any additional or closing remarks.","Tina Correia","Just wanted to thank you everyone for joining us today, appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you and that does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tina Correa, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Tina Correia","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today\u2019s call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the December 2018 quarter and our outlook for the March 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 o\u2019clock p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website along with the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call.","Today\u2019s presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial results can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 o\u2019clock p.m. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","With that, let me hand the call over to Tim.","Tim Archer","Thank you all for joining us today. It\u2019s good to be here with you on my first earnings call as Lam\u2019s CEO. I have met many of you before Lam events, but I recognize there are some on the call that may not know me quite as well. So I\u2019d like to start by briefly recapping how my experience at Lam and Novellus over the last 24 years has shaped my perspective on what it takes to compete and win in this business over the long term.","I have been fortunate to have opportunities that expanded the company\u2019s operations from being embedded as a process engineer inside the development fab of one of our leading customers to heading our technology organization in Japan to leading product groups through periods of key technology inflections to managing our worldwide sales organization. Most recently, I has been charged with driving company-wide business results as the CEO of Lam since the time of the merger with Novellus.","During this period, from calendar 2013 to 2018, we grew revenue by 2.7 times and increased earnings per share two times faster than the increase in revenue. From my experiences I believe in the critical importance of building deep and lasting customer collaborations founded on mutual trust. I am committed to continuously investing in a pipeline of differentiated products that help our customers address their most difficult technology and productivity challenges.","And as we see in the current environment, I value having a flexible operating model that enables us to respond rapidly to market changes to ensure we deliver on our commitments to our customers as well as our shareholders. I believe we are still in the early stages of a long-term secular growth story for the industry and particularly for Lam. What you can expect to see from my leadership as CEO is increased focus on leveraging our core strength to deliver technology and productivity solutions to the fastest growing segments of the semiconductor equipment market, which in the long-term we believe are those tied to the enablement of the emerging data economy. I am very proud of what our company has accomplished in recent years and I am honoured to have the opportunity to lead Lam to an even greater future.","Before I continue, I want to provide an update on the investigation we announced in connection with Martin\u2019s departure. As you know from our December press release, our board formed an independent special committee to lead a thorough investigation into allegations of misconduct and conduct inconsistent with our core values. That investigation is now substantially complete and there have been no other personal actions and none have been recommended by the special committee. Core values have always been a foundation of Lam\u2019s success and I am committed to a culture of trust, respect and open communication built around an environment in which our employees feel free to speak up on workplace issues.","To reinforce this culture, the special committee has recommended that we review our policies, practices and training related to workplace conduct and increased our communications on these topics. To reiterate what we said in December, the alleged misconduct did not call into question the integrity of the company\u2019s financial systems or controls, and the special committee\u2019s investigation has confirmed this.","Now turning to our view on the business. In line with our prior guidance, we delivered a solid December quarter despite a more challenging environment. We also completed the strongest calendar year in the history of the company with $10.871 billion in revenues, a 14% year-on-year increase at the same time we delivered growth in EPS of 27% and an increase in operating cash flows of more than 50% from the prior calendar year. I would like to thank our customers, our employees and our partners for their support and contribution to these results.","From Lam\u2019s perspective, industry performance for calendar 2018 came in largely as we have communicated in our prior earnings call. Overall, WFE was in line with our expectations of single-digit growth at approximately $50 billion with an increase in memory and a year-on-year decline in non-memory spending. Entering 2019, industry fundamentals have weakened, particularly within memory segments as customers continue to reign in both NAND and DRAM spending. At this point, 2019 WFE is looking to be down in the mid to high-teens range. For NAND, 2019 offers what we believe is a solid long-term setup for the industry as the supply bit growth rate is expected to decline throughout the year. NAND demand should continue to benefit from content increase in consumer and enterprise applications and we began to see initial signs of demand elasticity in the client SSD markets as we exited the 2018.","In DRAM, while near-term dynamics remaining challenging, customer behaviour remains rationale and industry profitability characteristics remain compelling. We believe customers are making prudent adjustments to capacity in response to the overall demand environment they are seeing. We expect DRAM WFE spend correction to extend through 2019 with supply growth fall into the mid-teens as we exit the year.","Non-memory segments are expected to grow in 2019 and with the continued rise in the importance of 3D architectures, technology innovation for transistor, interconnect and advanced packaging applications remains a critical priority for us as we grow our strategic relevance with our customers in this segment. In aggregate, we feel confident that we\u2019re operating in a rational industry environment, one that is well positioned to deliver attractive long-term growth and opportunity.","With that as context, we are executing to the growth strategy that I described during our Investor Day earlier last year. Our strategy focuses along three primary vectors: expanding the size of our served available markets, gaining market share in the segments in which we compete and increasing the recurring revenue stream we derived from our installed base. Etch and deposition processes are central to the success of our customers technology roadmaps and we continue to make substantial, comprehensive, yet disciplined investments in R&D to fund the innovation required to create differentiated solutions and long-term value.","In the December quarter, we continued to build on our leadership position in both NAND and DRAM for critical applications with key penetrations for high aspect ratio Etch, and 3D NAND dielectric stack deposition applications. Furthermore, we continued to extend our high aspect ratio Etch leadership into non-memory segments with critical wins for metal interconnect and spacer applications at a leading logic customer. In atomic layer deposition film quality, repeatability and productivity are fundamental elements of differentiation for Lam.","During the quarter, we gained momentum in both DRAM and NAND with new application wins. While we are pleased with these wins in critical applications, we are committed to strengthening the performance of our product portfolio across the board. Our R&D investments are squarely focused on achieving our vision of best-in-class products everywhere we compete.","Turning now to revenue derived from our expanding installed base, our customer support business group delivered another record year. Installed base revenue growth exceeded installed base unit growth again in 2018 with installed base units in the field ending the year at roughly 56,000 chambers. We closed out the year on a high note, signing with a key customer, the single largest installed base deal in our history. Our focus with CSBG is to provide innovative products and services, which create value for customers over the entire life cycle of tool ownership. We partner closely with customers as we help them extract increased technical capability and higher productivity from existing assets. And in return, we are building a strong recurring revenue stream for Lam.","2019 is shaping up to be another solid year for our customer support business group and our progress remains aligned with the long-term growth objectives communicated to the investment community early last year. In closing, the business environment is more challenging than just a few quarters ago, but we are committed to delivering on our multidimensional growth strategy and at the same time responding to near-term revenue trends through a strong focus on operational efficiency. Lam has a proven track record of execution and we believe we are fundamentally well positioned in the right segments of the market.","The new $5 billion share buyback program we announced earlier today in our press release reflects our continued confidence in Lam\u2019s long-term opportunities. Doug will provide details on the program in his comments.","Additionally, I\u2019d like to mention that I\u2019ll be on the road in the coming weeks and look forward to meeting with many of you. I will also be participating in the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference in San Francisco on February 13. Thanks. And now, here\u2019s Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Excuse me. Thanks Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Lam delivered solid performance in the December quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics.","Operating margin and earnings per share exceeded the high end of the guidance range provided, mainly due to our proactive management of our operating expenses.","Overall memory revenue increased slightly from the September quarter with the combined Memory segment making up 79% of total system revenue. NAND volume and memory revenue drove the increase in the Memory segment and it represented approximately 55% of system revenue. NAND investments were driven primarily by conversions to higher layer cut wafers.","DRAM represented 24% of system revenue in the December quarter, which was roughly flat with the prior quarter. The majority of spending in all of memory was targeted at conversions. The foundry segment declined quarter-over-quarter, accounting for 13% of system revenue, mainly due to reduced China foundry investments. You may recall on the September call, I spoke about how strong that was and it declined somewhat in December. The logic and other segment was up slightly, contributing 8% of system revenue.","From an industry perspective, Tim discussed our view of 2019 WFE. Currently, we believe WFE spending is weighted to the first half of 2019, driven by Foundry and Logic investments. We believe memory investments will be meaningfully lower in 2019 while the combined Foundry and Logic will be up. Our assumption based on our customer interactions is that there is not a significant recovery in memory spending throughout 2019. We expect the year in memory will be mainly driven by node conversions to lower our customers\u2019 cost per bit. DRAM spending will be primarily on conversions to 1y and a little bit of 1z and NAND converting to 96-Layer devices.","Let me now turn to our P&L performance. We delivered revenues of $2.523 billion in the December quarter. This was up sequentially by 8% from September and was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance.","Gross margin for the quarter came in at 46.3%. As I always do, I\u2019ll remind you, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volume, product mix and customer concentration. And we expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter.","Operating expenses in the quarter came in at $440 million, slightly down from the operating expense level in the September quarter. Worth noting, I think, we decreased our operating expenses for the first half of 2018 to the second half by approximately $100 million as we managed spending relative to the software business environment.","R&D comprised nearly two thirds of our total spending, consistent with the composition of spending in the previous two quarters. We\u2019ve maintained a high percentage of our OpEx and R&D to support the long-term growth objectives for the company.","Operating income in the December quarter was $728 million. Operating margin came in over the guidance range at 28.8%, mainly as a result of the reduced spending within the quarter as well as gross margin that came in slightly above the midpoint of our guided range.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the December quarter came in at 10%, which was slightly lower than the long-term rate. This was due to discrete tax benefits realized relative to statute of limitations explorations within the quarter. In the longer run, the tax rate in the low to middle teens is the right range for you to continue to include in your models. And there will be fluctuations in the tax rate from quarter-to-quarter.","Based on a share count of approximately 162 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter came in at $3.87, which exceeded our guidance range. The share count includes dilution from the 2041 convertible notes, and the dilutive impact was approximately six million shares in the December quarter. I\u2019ll remind you that the dilution schedule for the 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. I\u2019d also point out that the 2018 warrants mature during the December quarter.","We continue to execute on our capital return program. For the December quarter, we paid out $168 million in dividends. Related to the share buyback, in January of 2019, we completed our previous $4 billion share buyback authorization, repurchasing over 23 million shares in total. Additionally, as Tim mentioned and that we noted in the press release we issued today, our board has approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock. Today\u2019s capital return announcement is consistent with our current plan of returning at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders. And in summary, for the calendar 2018 year, we returned $3 billion share buybacks and over $500 million in dividends, which along with the new authorization that was announced today, continues to demonstrate our commitment to shareholder return.","Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, was flat with the September quarter at $3.9 billion. During the December quarter, our cash from operations came in at $642 million, which was offset by pay down on our commercial paper program of approximately $360 million as well as the dividends that I have previously mentioned.","For the 2018 calendar year, our cash from operations was over $3 billion. This was consistent with what I mentioned in the last earnings call.","DSO during the quarter decreased by five days to 67 days. Our inventory levels decreased, and consistent with our expectations, inventory turns increased to 3.2 times, which was an improvement from 2.7 times in the prior quarter.","Company noncash expenses included approximately $39 million for equity comp, $36 million for amortization and $46 million for depreciation.","Capital expenditures came in at $106 million in the December quarter, which was an increase of $56 million from September. Due to the timing of certain projects, December quarter CapEx was a little bit on the high side of what we expected. I expect that as we go into calendar 2019, CapEx will be somewhat lower than the 2018 level.","As we noted in the last quarter, our CapEx investments are focused on manufacturing expansion for our installed base business as well as strategic R&D investments.","We exited the quarter with approximately 10,950 regular full time employees, which was relatively flat with September quarter. I think it\u2019s worth noting that we maintain flexibility in managing our cost by adjusting our temporary workforce for short-term changes in business conditions. We reduced our temporary headcount by over 700 people since the peak levels we were carrying earlier this year.","So now looking ahead, I\u2019d like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the March quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2,400,000,000 plus or minus a $150 million. We\u2019re forecasting gross margin of 44.5% plus or minus one percentage point. Gross margins will decline sequentially due to customer concentration, product mix and lower factory volumes. And as I just mentioned, as we sit here today, we expect the gross margin percentage will be at a low point in March relative to the rest of calendar year 2019. We\u2019re forecasting operating margins of 25% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $3.40 plus or minus $0.20 based on the share count of approximately 159 million shares.","And I just remind you that in the March quarter, we have an extra work week in the fiscal quarter, which happens approximately every six years due to the fiscal calendar cutoff. March spending is expected to be higher in cost of goods sold as well as operating expenses as a result of the extra work week. I\u2019ll also remind you that the March quarter has seasonal impacts due to payroll taxes that go up in the beginning of the year. Both of these things are included in our stated guidance.","For 2019, first half business view is lower than our prior outlook, given the recent announcements of reductions that you\u2019ve seen from commentary from others in the technology space. With this current environment, we continue to exercise and discipline in our spending, and we\u2019re focused on prioritizing investments to support Lam\u2019s SAM expansion, market share gains and installed base growth.","Operator that concludes my prepared remarks, Tim and I will now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question today from C. J. Muse with Evercore.","C. J. Muse","Yes good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question. As you think about WFE levels in the 4Q and 1Q time frame, can you share with us what you think the implied forward \u2013 growth rate is for both DRAM and NAND?","Doug Bettinger","C. J. it\u2019s Doug. I think, generally speaking, as Tim mentioned, we expect bit growth as we go through 2019 to decline as we go through the year as customers adjust their spending. Overall, I think 2018 ended from a NAND standpoint in the low-40s. DRAM, I think, is low-20s. And we expect that to decline as we go through 2019, Tim, as customers adjust their spending levels. Tim, would you add anything?","Tim Archer","No, I think that\u2019s \u2013 the comment is we, at this point, see us ending the year below what Lam has said about the long-term sustainable demand growth rates. So I think that, it\u2019s why we\u2019re pretty optimistic about the setup exiting 2019.","C. J. Muse","I guess, if I could clarify the question. If you look at order run rates today, what is the implied bit growth that would come online, say, three, four quarters from now? I think you\u2019ve done analysis on that where I think Q4 DRAM, we\u2019re tracking maybe up 10%. If spending just stayed at those levels, is there any analysis you can share there with us on both DRAM and NAND?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Tim. I don\u2019t have specific numbers for you except what we describe, which is as we go through the year, it\u2019s going to decline as customers adjust their spending level.","C. J. Muse","Okay. And as a follow-up, I\u2019m trying to do a little bit more work here and better understand your leverage to technology versus capacity buys, in particular, as it relates on the 3D NAND site in high aspect ratio etch. So can you walk through what percentage of overall etch spend or etch is in 3D, particularly as we scale up the layer counts?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Tim. We haven\u2019t given hard numbers on that. But as I think as customers invest in conversions, they spend less money but they spend more as a percentage on etch and deposition. We describe that consistently in the past, and that\u2019s very much what we see happening this year.","Tim Archer","But I think if the question was the percentage of high aspect ratio applications where Lam\u2019s position is very strong, it\u2019s increasing node by node. And that\u2019s just based on the fact that it takes longer in general to complete those etches. And that\u2019s, obviously, our task to make those continuously faster. But it is increasing at each technology node.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, C. J.","C. J. Muse","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you. Doug and Tim, I had a question just about the trajectory of the year. So if I take the WFE you guys are guiding to like 42 for this year, it looks like your product WFE share, you don\u2019t tell us what services are. But it looks like your product WFE share is somewhere in the low-15s the past couple of years. So if I could just assume that they flat, which I wonder that it will given that UV\u2019s ramping, that implies that revenue kind of like is flat throughout the rest of the year from this level. Is that the wrong way to think about it? Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Tim, I think what we try to describe in short. Yes, Tim, I\u2019m getting confused who I\u2019m talking to. I think as the year sets up, we expect the first half of the year is going to be weighted towards Foundry and Logic. It will be stronger in the first half from the second half. And memory is may be a little bit stronger in the second half than the first half. We don\u2019t see a significant recovery occurring on memory, I would point that out. But I think, as you know, we tend to be very, very strong in memory. So with memory down year-on-year, our share likely trends along with that. That\u2019s not a statement around any application, win or loss. It\u2019s just a statement of who\u2019s spending money. Tim, would you add anything?","Tim Archer","Yes. I think internally in the company, I don\u2019t think your thinking is too far off. And we look at the most important measures of success for us this year. And it\u2019s how we\u2019re doing on the applications that we want to make sure that we own when the spending does pick up. And as long as we\u2019re doing that, then the precise timing of when spending comes back in NAND is less important to us. So it\u2019s really our focus.","Timothy Arcuri","Got it. And then Doug, I had a question on deferred revenue. It was down about $130 million again. So it sounds like shipments were more like maybe $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter. So my question is how much more can you draw down deferred revenue? Because obviously, it sounds like if you give a shipments in March, it will be lower than $2.4 billion. But where does that number \u2013 where does that $493 million worth of deferred revenue? Where does that bottom out? Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, I think I\u2019ve described it, Tim, in the past. It\u2019s going to bounce around $100 million quarter-on-quarter. I think some quarters, it will be down as you\u2019re seeing now. Some quarters, I think, it will also be up. I don\u2019t know that it meaningfully changes from the level where it\u2019s at right now. But it will very depend on the percentage of new tools we\u2019re shipping, how strong the business with certain customers is, certain regions of the world is little bit different. I don\u2019t view it as going to zero at any point, Tim. But it will bounce around plus or minus $100 million, it is how I would be thinking about it.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, got it. So Doug, so I mean shipments are about equal to revenue for March, is that right?","Doug Bettinger","Yes. I\u2019m not guiding shipments anymore, Tim. What I said was it will be plus or minus $100 million quarter-by-quarter. Some quarters will be down. Some quarters will be up. It\u2019s all just timing, quite honestly.","Timothy Arcuri","Got it, okay. Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, thanks, Tim.","Operator","We\u2019ll now hear from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Doug, maybe another way to ask Tim\u2019s question. I was intrigued that you commented that March quarter should be the bottom in gross margin for the year. I\u2019m just kind of curious, is that because you expect March to be the low point in revenue? Are there mix drivers that helped gross margin going forward?","Doug Bettinger","I always say, John, there\u2019s a variety of different things that impact gross margin. I usually mentioned three things. Overall business volume is a component. But as I think, we have a highly variable cost structure. This isn\u2019t a big fixed cost business. This isn\u2019t like our customers. We\u2019re highly variable in our cost. Tool mix is important. Not all of our tools have the same gross margin. And sometimes, that mix will be beneficial sequentially. Sometimes, it will be negative. And then customer concentration, when you get the bigger customer spending more or it\u2019s that more concentrated customers, you might have a little bit of margin headwinds. All of those things are important to think about relative to the trend in gross margin, and all of those are relevant to the comment I had about March being a low point.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe kind of a follow-up to CJ\u2019s question, just relative \u2013 appreciate the fact that in this volatile environment, your willingness to give us a view on the full year on WFE being down mid-to-high teens. I\u2019m just kind of curious when you look at your SAM and whether that be some incremental share gains on the Logic front at 10 or some incremental SAM gains as we go from 64 to 96 and\/or 1x to 1y to 1z. Do you think your SAM outperforms, performs in line or underperforms the overall WFE this year, Tim?","Tim Archer","I think if we \u2013 taking all those things into account you just said, I would think that we feel that our SAM actually underperforms to be a few this year. And that\u2019s primarily because of the heavy concentration of our SAM in 3D NAND as you know. And so I think that should be the expectation if the year plays out as we have described, which is no material increase in 3D NAND or NAND spending through the year.","John Pitzer","Helpful, thanks, guys.","Doug Bettinger","Yes. Thanks, Joh.","Operator","Krish Sankar with Cowen has our next question.","Krish Sankar","Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, Doug and Tim, just on the reconcile what you said in the front of WFE year versus what ASML said, is it fair to assume is it because the back half is mainly concentrated on EUV from the foundry side? And then I had a follow-up, too.","Tim Archer","I think there is a few things, and I will let Doug jump in here with his comments as well. But when you look at ASML\u2019s comments and as best we understand them kind of talking about the recovery in DRAM in the second half of the year, that\u2019s not necessarily inconsistent with us exiting the year with a better setup for the first half. And I think that you have to think about the way the tools come in into new \u2013 into fabs and new projects.","Our experiences that litho and metrology tools usually lead etch and deposition tools sometimes by as much as a quarter or so. So that made those statements maybe not inconsistent, and that\u2019s kind of why we\u2019re thinking about it. I mean, I guess, our view, everybody in this environment will have a slightly different view in spending to come back. But we\u2019re wanting to state at this point that our best view from conversations with customers is no material increase in memory spending throughout 2019.","Doug Bettinger","Yes. I don\u2019t have anything to really add, Krish. I think as Tim said, litho usually leads our stuff. And we\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re seeing right now. We could have it wrong. But when we parsed what we heard from ASML, I didn\u2019t really feel inconsistent to us.","Krish Sankar","Got it, got it. Actually, that\u2019s very helpful, Tim and Doug. As a follow-up question, when you talk to your memory customers, I\u2019m kind of curious how do they look at CapEx? Are they waiting for their pricing\/margins to bottom before they start getting comfortable about buying semi cap equipment? Or is it going to be in tandem? Or does one lead the other? And as a subset to that, which thing is going to recover first from here onwards in NAND or DRAM? Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Well. It\u2019s a tough question. I mean I think that actually, when they\u2019re going to spend is a question better asked to them. I mean, exactly what metrics they\u2019re looking at. I guess, if we look at which of the two, NAND or DRAM might recover earlier, I mean I guess, if we look back, we saw NAND correction starting earlier in 2018 than DRAM did. And so we\u2019re \u2013 I guess, at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about demand. But we see both of them tracking as we get to the end of the year, well below what we think are the long-term demand growth bit rates. So either one could recover. Neither one could recover. I mean that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not a great view, but we think that in both cases, the market sets up for investment in either one as we exit the year.","Doug Bettinger","Well, what I would tell you, my personal view, Krish. It will recover at some point. That I know for sure. And the trend we see relative to spending in the year that we just described suggests to what Tim and I that they\u2019re going to need to invest relative to long-term bit demand. We just don\u2019t necessarily see it happening in 2019 quite yet, at least not in a meaningful way.","Krish Sankar","Got it. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Krish.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for the detail and outlook for 2019. But can you guys just true us up on your prior view first half of 2019 versus the second half of last year? Relative to the weak spending environment, how are you seeing the first half of this year relative to last year second half?","Doug Bettinger","Yes. Harlan, what I tried to described in my remarks is first half of 2019 now looks weaker than it previously did. And I\u2019m not going to give quantification of it because then I\u2019d essentially be guiding you for two quarters. We\u2019re going to get back to our normal practice of guiding one quarter at a time. But given the well-understood weakness of smartphones and inventory adjustments in some of our customers as well as the cloud guys, it\u2019s somewhat weaker than it was when we describe it last time.","Harlan Sur","Great, appreciate the insights there. And given the view on WFE being down kind of mid to high-teens this year, at the same time, the team had a strong shipment growth the last couple of years. You were driving \u2013 I was looking at it first half of last year, you guys were driving like 25% year-over-year shipment growth. Many of these tools are coming off warranty and on to service contracts this year. So this should be a tailwind for the team. So how should we think about the installed base business trajectory relative to your WFE outlook?","Tim Archer","Well, I guess, I\u2019ll try to cover some of that in my opening remarks. But clearly, we feel very good about our installed base business on two dimensions. One, the strengths of Lam\u2019s business over the last several years has caused our overall installed base to grow. So there is more tools for which we can sell things. And two, we\u2019ve been investing in that business to create new products and services. Some in the areas of vis-\u00e0-vis the data economy, using data to make our tools more productive for customers. And those products and services are getting traction, and this will be another strong year for CSBG for our installed base business. So that\u2019s a focus of mine, and I think it provides a very important revenue stream for the company long-term.","Harlan Sur","Yes, thanks for the insights.","Tim Archer","Yes. Thanks, Harlan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. On that topic of installed base business, I wonder if you guys have considered providing sort of better disclosure around that? It seems like that will go a long way towards understanding the sustainability of that business versus the other parts of the business.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, I guess, we haven\u2019t really accomplished our objective very well, Joe. We\u2019ve been talking a lot more about it more recently than we have. We\u2019re providing you with tools kind of the installed base on a consistent basis and I will try to make it easy to understand everything we talked about in the past. Relative to segment reporting, we\u2019re not going to do that. We don\u2019t need too, because we\u2019re not tripping the roles up there. And from a competitive standpoint, we don\u2019t necessarily want to have an out quite as visible unless we have to. But it is a meaningful part of how we generate profit. It\u2019s a meaningful part of how we generate cash for sure. And we\u2019re trying to talk more about it, so you understand it. I mean, Tim talked quite a bit about it. So we\u2019ll keep trying to do a better job, Joe.","Joe Moore","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess, in terms of the buyback and the pace of the buyback and 50% of free cash, what\u2019s your assessment of the right amount of cash to have on the balance sheet? And do you need to have any? Can you be leveraged? How do you think long-term about what the balance sheet should look like?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Joe. I haven\u2019t communicated specific numbers. We need a certain amount of cash. We like to be able to fund a certain amount of R&D and CapEx and so forth. We\u2019re carrying more cash today than we need to run the company. What we decide to do relative to that, I think, we\u2019ll evolve over time. But I don\u2019t have a hard and fast number that I\u2019m going to share with you necessarily. We certainly could have more debt on the balance sheet know if we chose to do that. And the pace of the buyback, I think we\u2019re going to be opportunistic. I\u2019m not going to communicate a timeframe and I will let you know quarter-by-quarter on how we\u2019re thinking about it and what we\u2019re doing.","Joe Moore","Very helpful. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, thanks, Joe.","Operator","Patrick Ho with Stifel has our next question.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Maybe first question in terms of the installed base business, I think in your last Analyst Day, you talked about $1 billion incremental opportunity. Over the next three to five years, how do you see the revenue growth rate? Is this a 10% type of growth business? Or do you see a higher to get to that incremental billion dollars you talked about?","Tim Archer","Well, I guess \u2013 yes, so you recall the billion-dollar number. I mean, as I mentioned, we\u2019re on \u2013 we feel we are on track for that trajectory. At the Investor Day, we said that the installed base business was approximately 25% of our total revenue. And so, I guess, with that information, you kind of healthy growth rate. It\u2019s a business that is definitely growing. Our objective is to have the installed base business itself grow faster than the rate of growth at the installed base. And now again, we provide information this year with the installed base growing from approximately 50,000 chambers to an ending \u2013 year ending 56,000 chambers at the end of last year. So maybe with those, you can triangulate the numbers. We can also maybe do it for you and get back to you.","Doug Bettinger","Yes. Patrick, how I think about it and Tim described it the way I think about it, which is on a normalized rate, it\u2019s been about 25% of the company\u2019s business. If you recall back at the Investor Day, Tim described three growth vectors, each about the same size. So if you think about installed base, it\u2019s a third of the growth and normalized at 25% of the business, so you can triangulate that way relative to the growth at that. It will grow faster than the installed base for sure. Now in the year like 2019, if it shapes up the way perhaps, it\u2019s going to with WFE down as much. It will be more than 25%, obviously.","Tim Archer","I think one important point since we\u2019re talking about installed base business. I just mentioned, I think it can sometimes get lost in terms of how we are driving this business faster than the installed base itself is growing. And it all comes down to investing in the creation of new products and services. Things that help the customer relocate tools for new applications, extend the technology for those toolsets the new applications, higher productivity, higher throughput from owned assets. And as we\u2019ve seen in many ways, the lagging node business gets stronger and more heavily utilized. We find a lot of installed base business for tools that have been around and out in the field for quite a number of years. We have just lot of interest in getting new products and services for that fleet. So it\u2019s a pretty attractive business.","Patrick Ho","Great. That\u2019s also very helpful.","Tim Archer","Go ahead. If you can do one more, if you got it, Patrick.","Patrick Ho","Real quick on the DRAM on the memory side of things, we know that capital intensity trends increase on the 3D NAND side of things with the layer count. How do you see the transition for etch and deposition as you go from 1x to 1y and eventually to 1z?","Doug Bettinger","Our SAM continues to grow as we step through that. That\u2019s all about self-aligned patterning and that is very etch and deposition SAM, Patrick.","Tim Archer","Yes. And actually, these technology nodes also create new opportunities for films. I mean I spoke a little bit about our effort in atomic layer deposition. As you step from 1x to 1y to 1z, there are new applications being created for atomic layer deposition for instance that wouldn\u2019t have existed in prior nodes. And so we\u2019re looking at it both from growth in our existing applications as well as our ability to win new ones also.","Patrick Ho","Thank you.","Tim Archer","Yes, thanks, Patrick.","Operator","We\u2019ll now hear from Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik","Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, quick clarification on the last earnings call, you guys expected DRAM up in first half this year versus second half last year and NAND down. Is it fair to say that you\u2019re seeing both the DRAM and NAND down in first half of this year versus second half last year?","Doug Bettinger","Yes. We\u2019re not going to provide segment level color on the quarterly guide except we gave a little color on how we see WFE setting up in that [indiscernible] like, which is foundry logic is first half weighted. Memory, probably a little bit stronger than the second half.","Atif Malik","Got it. And then can you just talk about what you seeing with respect to domestic spending in China? If I recall correctly, you have talked about China domestic was $5 billion in spending last year. What could it be in the $42 billion to $43 billion WFE this year?","Tim Archer","Yes. Actually, we did say that we saw 2018 was going to come in at about a $5 billion range. I think when all is said and done, it may have come in a little bit lower than that but pretty close. We actually see 2019 shaping up to be a bit stronger. And if we look actually at the SAM and share position that we hold where the money will be spent this year NAND\u2019s China domestic business should be up.","Atif Malik","Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Atif.","Operator","Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson Companies has our next question.","Tom Diffely","Yes, good afternoon. Maybe just a quick end market question, you know after three or four quarters of the price declines in the NAND market, are you seeing evidence of the elasticity of demand that we\u2019ve been talking about for a couple of years?","Tim Archer","Yes, I had a very small comment in my opening remarks about the fact that we believe we have seen some demand elasticity at the end of last year and it was primarily driven by an uptick that we\u2019ve seen in the adoption rate of SSDs into client. And there was some data to show the percentage of laptops or client devices with the SSD in the lower price ranges had a material uptick. And so it\u2019s just one data point, but we do think that as prices have come down we\u2019re starting to see increased demand.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And given that when you look at kind of the long-term view, the next two to five years, do you still \u2013 or do you view NAND market as the real big opportunity for you versus the DRAM market knowing that both our strong?","Tim Archer","Both for us without doubt. Our SAM position if you think may be just the world we\u2019ve gone through, the transition from 2D to 3D NAND, we had a very meaningful increase in the intensity of etch and deposition in that space. And when you think about also end-demand, we see NAND outpacing all other markets. And so that\u2019s why when I talk about our focus on applications that we want to hold continuously in that critical space in the NAND area.","Now, of course, we want to do well in all markets, but NAND is our biggest opportunity going forward and in the long term.","Doug Bettinger","Just, add-on from me Tom, independent of where things are at in 2019, I\u2019m extraordinarily optimistic on the opportunity for both NAND as well as DRAM going forward. Again, Tim alluded to the data economy. We talked about that extensively at the Investor Day. All of that stuff is still completely intact. It doesn\u2019t mean it will happen every single year, it won\u2019t. But data is exploding in society. It is not useful unless you can store it and you need a low latency memory to do anything in computer architectures. Memory is critically enabling for all of that and none of that has changed.","Tom Diffely","Great. Thank you very much.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham and Company.","Quinn Bolton","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Just want to come back on your prepared comments. You mentioned share gains and high aspect ratio at 3D NAND deposition and ALD wins in both NAND and DRAM. Can those share gains help offset some of the SAM underperformance you see in 2019 or do you really think that that we need to see the memory markets recovering before you see the full benefit of those share gains?","Doug Bettinger","Well simple answer is no. They cannot offset the magnitude of decline that we see this year. But the other aspect that is one of timing. Typically, the types of applications and wins I was speaking to, we focus on critical application wins, usually one to two nodes before that node ever ends up ramping. And so in the majority of those cases those would be entering production sometime next year or the following either. And that\u2019s why the start of like \u2013 those are the applications once you win it you kind of know that your businesses is pretty well locked in for the foreseeable future.","Quinn Bolton","Just a quick follow-up on the China domestic is that fairly well balanced between memory and foundry logic or just one segment lead the other end in 2019?","Doug Bettinger","It\u2019s fairly well balanced. Quinn, I mean, memory is probably somewhat stronger than foundry logic, but there\u2019s a broad base set of customers that are spending it\u2019s not just one or two.","Quinn Bolton","Great, thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Quinn.","Operator","Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank has our next question.","Sidney Ho","Well thanks for taking my question. I will start off with a clarification you said revenue will be first halfway weighted in 2019. Is that an expectation for your revenue or is it for the industry?","Doug Bettinger","No, it was a statement Sidney around WFE. I didn\u2019t say anything relative to Lams revenue. It was a statement on WFE.","Sidney Ho","Okay, great. And then my question, it looks like from three months ago to now the change is primarily coming from the DRAM side CapEx slowing down. Would you say the NAND side is also incrementally weaker or do you think there\u2019s more stability there and then NAND CapEx everyday you start cutting earlier?","Doug Bettinger","Well, we haven\u2019t, so far Sidney in the past, given you any color on the full year of 2019 this is first time we\u2019re making statements on the full year or so I\u2019m not sure I can\u2019t even say anything about trajectory what we thought before because we hadn\u2019t done all the full analytic work that we\u2019ve now have done on 2019.","Sidney Ho","All right, maybe just a housekeeping one. Your operating expense is obviously much lower than what you guided for the December quarter, understanding March is an extra week, should we think about June quarter kind of go back to the December level or is it just something higher than that?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, I\u2019m not going to guide it beyond the current quarter Sidney, everything else equal, flattish to maybe slightly down if you just take the one week out, but we\u2019ll give you the hard guidance when we get to earnings in the quarter.","Sidney Ho","Okay. All right, thank you very much.","Doug Bettinger","Yes. Thanks Sydney.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear now from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just had one on kind of your commentary in the back half in memory dynamics. So I guess what is the reason why there wouldn\u2019t be a significant increase in investment when you move to 96-Layer technology? Is that because the majority of the WFE spend or the increase in memory spend is because of the planar NAND transition or 3D NAND transition or is it because there\u2019s something special about 96 and makes it a lower investment cycle?","Doug Bettinger","No, there\u2019s nothing special about 96 what we see happening, Mitch primarily is node conversions in both DRAM as well as 3D NAND and so that\u2019s the way to be thinking about it. It\u2019s a heavy focus of spending on node conversions which \u2013 that\u2019s a very cost effective way for our customers to invest because they just need to upgrade essentially etch and deposition equipment or add into the process flow. Tim, would you add anything?","Tim Archer","No, I think that\u2019s fair obviously it\u2019s heavily driven by the ratio of node conversions to greenfield ads. On a greenfield basis, last year I showed a chart that described our increase in opportunity at 96-Layer and fundamentally on a greenfield basis, it\u2019s significantly higher as you go to 96. So the dynamic of the conversion versus greenfield ads that\u2019s Doug speaking to.","Mitch Steves","Perfect. Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, thanks Mitch. Operator, we\u2019re going to do one more.","Operator","So now our final question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Bank.","Vijay Rakesh","Hi guys, good quarter. Just on your 2019, just wondering, when you look at 96-Layer 3D NAND, what do you \u2013 how do you see capital intensity at 64 versus 96?","Doug Bettinger","If you do a greenfield-to-greenfield wafer, our capital intensity goes up, you\u2019ve got a longer process flow, you\u2019ve more tools and the process flow goes up. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve quantified it. The good part for our business is when you do that conversion, all you\u2019re really adding is etch and deposition equipment, you\u2019re making the stack bigger and the etch becomes a little bit more challenging to do and so it takes longer.","Vijay Rakesh","Okay. And just as you talk about a little bit more softness in memory spending through the year have you seen \u2013 are you seeing any push out on either the 96 layer three 3D NAND or 1Y transition in DRAM side? Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","From a timing standpoint, no, I mean we always had expected 2019 would be a 1Y investment year in DRAM with the, the beginning of 1Z and the investments in NAND would be on 96 layer devices and that\u2019s totally what we\u2019re saying and again, it\u2019s primarily focused on conversions right now.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, thank you.","Tina Correia","Okay, so this concludes our conference call for this quarter. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","This will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Stating the obvious, we are extremely pleased with the performance of the company that we reported and guided today. As challenging as it is to scale our company from an average calendar \u201916 quarterly output level by more than 40% which is the reality of our 2.4 billion recent quarter shipments. It is gratifying to see the results of our collective efforts. Our strategy of the developments of an increasingly critical and enabling products and services portfolio, our consistent execution across all functions of the company and last but not least the tremendous commitment of our employees and partners globally are all necessary components of a multi-year outperformance story. It is a privilege to lead this company and on behalf of the entire management team I would like to thank everybody that contributed, the very same people that are creating as we speak the next world of opportunity in our future.","We delivered record financial results once again in the March quarter, with shipments and revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and non-GAAP EPS above the high-end of our guidance range. For all the reasons previously communicated and reinforced by our actual performance currently, we believe LAM is in an excellent position with our leadership and competency in etch, deposition, and clean product conservative to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing for many years to come. Turning to the broader industry environment, as stated already the momentum of investment levels in the segments that we participate is net positive. Capacity addition and technology conversion trends appear rational and strategic, both elements leading to a strengthened outlook for the calendar year. Since our last earnings call, expectations for the year have improved. We are now guiding a first half shipment stronger than previously anticipated, with a second half now slightly more balanced than the no better than 55\/45 reference of the last earnings call and the optimism that we have for sustainable technology demand trends is further strengthened by well publicized plans throughout the electronics ecosystem.","In short, silicon continues to sit at the very center of long-term electronics technology and applications innovation. That is the fundamental opportunity for our industry and specifically for Lam Research. Market trends and our initial modeling indicates continued strength of WFE in 2018 also. Memory company cash flows, memory unit pricing and the implied commentary on supply and demand balance are broadly well analyzed and reported at this point. We have no incremental perspective to share at this time. Demand continues to be strong for NAND in the SSD and embedded markets driving increased spending activity for NAND in 2017. We expect total 3D NAND shipped capacity at year-end to represent slightly more than the 50% of the installed base with a balance of Greenfield and conversion investments this year. In DRAM, we continue to anticipate double-digit growth in equipment spending in calendar \u201917 year-over-year, with investments being dominated by technology conversion.","We now model a modest growth in foundry and logic spending combined as leading edge devices increasingly meet performance targets and adoption criteria for the broad range of advanced computation market needs. These additional investments are focused primarily at the 10-nanomter technology node this year. Overall, we believe calendar \u201917 wafer fabrication equipment spending and to a greater extent our SAM and our own business levels are all tracking positively against previously stated expectation. The intended headlines today for the company are clear we hope. We continue to invest in the positioning of enabling technology, products and services with benchmark level R&D funding approaching two thirds of our overall operating expenses in support of our customers plans and to build sustainable value for Lam Research. We are actively working to enhance the competitive differentiation momentum of five years of profitable growth averaging an 18% revenue CAGR, with calendar \u201817 expected to be our most significant revenue, profit and cash generation growth year yet this decade.","With the anticipated business plans of our customers, their equipment selections already made, and the continued operational execution standard of LAM, we have every confidence in our industry outperformance potential long term. We have singular focus on our corporate strategy and vision that we consider compelling for all stakeholders. Specifically, we believe that our intuitive focus on customer trust and a collaborative culture, a flexible business model, and a result to invest strategically in our long term success with a commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders all combine to create a rewarding opportunity. Last but not least, we believe that the secular demand trends and outlook for the world of technology and electronic applications are more compelling than ever with the silicon roadmap and the role of Lam Research front and center.","With that let me turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Bettinger","Thanks Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today for our March 2017 quarterly earnings call. The March quarter represented a solid start to the calendar year. We delivered record levels of shipments, revenue, gross margin dollars, operating income dollars, and earnings per share. Each of these metrics grew double digits quarter over quarter. Financial performance was above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics, with operating margin and earnings per share above the high-end of the range we provided to you last quarter. Shipments for the quarter were strong at $2.413 billion which was up 25% sequentially and again above the midpoint of the guided range. Memory shipments were very strong in the quarter, as customers continued their investments in three 3D NAND capacity. Our customers are investing in new 3D wafers, they're converting planar to 3D and they're also embarking on 3D technology conversions to increase layer count. NAND demand continues to be strong driven by growth in enterprise and client SSDs as well as mobile device density increases. The combined memory segment represented 73% of total system level shipments and that compares with 61% in the prior quarter. Memory shipments were weighted heavily towards - excuse me, the nonvolatile segment which represented 50% of shipments in the March quarter compared with 37% in the prior quarter.","DRAM shipments grew 24% sequentially in dollar terms and made up 23% of system shipments. DRAM shipments comprise 24% of system shipments in the December quarter. We're seeing an uptick in DRAM spending in line with improving demand in content growth from areas such as smartphones and servers. DRAM spending is largely focused on conversions with the majority being conversions to the 1x nanometer node. The foundry segment was flattish sequentially in dollar terms accounting for 24% of system shipments. Foundry spending was a combination of leading-edge 10 nanometer capacity, initial 7 nanometer pilot investments as well as continued spending at 28 nanometer and above with the latter being primarily focused in China. And finally the logic and other segment contributed 3% of system shipments. Revenue came in at $2.154 billion in the March quarter, which was up roughly 14% from the December quarter. Gross margin for the period came in 46.1% above the midpoint of our guidance. And as I've shared with you before, our gross margins are a function of a number of factors such as overall business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, so you will see variability quarter to quarter. And I just like to remind you that our financial model is still the best way to think about our ongoing profitability performance.","Operating expenses in the quarter grew as we knew they would to $414 million. This compares to $384 million in the December quarter. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to 19% compared to 20% in the prior quarter. And as Martin pointed out, the majority of our OpEx spending continues to be allocated to funding our critical R&D programs. Operating income in the March quarter came in at $578 million and that compares to $490 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 26.9%, above the high end of the guided range. The tax rate for the quarter was 12% compared with 15% last quarter. The tax rate in the March quarter was favorably impacted by the release of tax liabilities from the conclusion of certain tax matters. Additionally, we had a reserve release related to the Novellus acquisition that is included in the GAAP results. The tax rate in the low-to-mid teens for the remainder of 2017 would be reasonable for you to use in your earnings models.","Based on our share count of approximately 182 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter totaled $2.80, above the guided range. This share count includes dilution on a non-GAAP basis from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes, with a total dilutive impact of about 16 million shares. And I\u2019ll remind you that dilution schedules for the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. This quarter we returned $213 million to our shareholders, $73 million in dividend distributions and $140 million in share repurchases. We took delivery of 1.2 million shares at an average price of $114.30. We\u2019ve completed approximately 20% of our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization and I'll let you know that we plan to initiate a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in the June quarter.","Now let me return to the balance sheet. We continue to have both a solid cash position and healthy cash generation. Cash and short-term investments including restricted cash increased modestly to $6.140 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash from operations was $423 million and that compares to $404 million in December. DSO held steady at 69 days in the March quarter, the same level as in December. Inventory turns were 4.2 which was up slightly from 4.1 in the prior quarter. This turns number is the highest we've achieved since we've combined LAM with Novellus. We exited the quarter with deferred revenues of $842 million, which was up from $673 million in December. This amount excludes $260 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments are up from $129 million in the December quarter. And I'll just remind you that these Japanese shipments remain on our balance sheet as inventory carried at cost. And I'll just do the math for you. I'd like to point out that this combined deferred shipment bucket now stands at $1.1 billion and it grew 37% in the March quarter. I expect deferred revenue will grow again in the June quarter.","Company noncash expenses for the quarter included the following; $35 million for equity comp, $38 million for amortization and $38 million for the depreciation. Capital expenditures were $44 million which was up from $37 million in the December quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 8,600 regular full-time employees, which was up about 400 from the end of the December quarter. The increase in headcount was in support of our growing business levels primarily in the operations and field organizations. Additionally, we're bringing on board the talent required to execute on our forward looking R&D programs.","Now looking ahead, I\u2019d like to provide you our guidance - for non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We're expecting another record shipment of $2.500 billion plus or minus $100 million. We\u2019re expecting record revenue of $2.300 billion plus or minus $100 million. We\u2019re forecasting gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point and we're forecasting operating margins of 27% plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we\u2019re forecasting earnings per share of $3, plus or minus $0.12 based on a share count of approximately 180 million shares. We're obviously pleased with our performance this quarter and with the guidance we've just shared for the June quarter. Our business has never been stronger financially and we're continuing to execute extremely well. We're in the right place at the right time with the right products. We're partnering with our customers to enable the transitions happening within the industry today and we're making the investments required to sustain our business long term. ","Operator that concludes my prepared remarks, Martin and I would now like open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Stephen Chin with UBS Bank.","Stephen Chin","My first question is just on your early outlook for the 2018 industry wafer fab equipment spending. Does 2018 appear to be another growth year for WFE because of indigenous China or is it just continued spend by incumbent than in foundry and memory logic? Thanks.","Martin Anstice","I think if I try to answer that definitively, I'd be a little bit misleading. I think that it\u2019s still early days but based on the data points that we see today Stephen, we see sustainability in the context of the discipline of capital investments, the relative balance and stability between kind of supply and demand as best we can tell in the industry. And particularly on the last part of your question, the China story, the domestic China story at least we believe it's more of a calendar \u201918 investment than calendar \u201917. So really our comments are comments about discipline in capacity additions and what we think are pretty compelling and exciting, and sustainable long-term demand trends. At the end of the day if that plays out as it is more generally described today the investment will follow.","Stephen Chin","Just a quick follow-up on memory CapEx to sales trends. It sounds like memory fundamentals are healthy and historically we've seen memory industry have a CapEx to sales ratio of 30% to 35%. Do you think that CapEx to sales ratio is still a good sustainable scenario for the market or it's likely that CapEx to sales to go higher in light of the scalability issues with 3D NAND and slowing DRAM transition. Thanks.","Martin Anstice","Honestly Stephen, I've never been a really big fan of capital intensity ratios because I think it kind of whipsaws us around in terms of the analytics in any one quarter and the reality is the economics of an addition in new capacity is a very different economics than a conversion. We're pretty agnostic in the NAND space to how our customers execute those plans as we've previously described. And in terms of wafer starts, it looks to us like the investments of this year are kind of pretty balanced between Greenfield and conversion. So we look to the sustainability question more in terms of kind of balance of bit growth demand and our understanding of supply additions. And I think kind of the market generally is telling that story. So I don't really have anything to tell you that will cause the future to be very different from the past in terms of that particular metric.","Doug Bettinger","The only thing I\u2019d like to point out Stephen is obviously, you know what memory revenue is likely to be this year, it's super strong, right. And so you\u2019ve always have to think about affordability and clearly the levels that are going on today are affordable given how strong revenue and memory is.","Operator","Moving onto to our next question, our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri","I guess the first question, Doug is to you. Just looking out into the third calendar quarter, it looks like you guys said a little used words a little more balanced than what the 55\/45 was, so maybe it sounds like second half shipments was down something like maybe 10% half on half. So that would sort of say 4.5 million shipments in the back half of the year. So maybe [indiscernible] in the third calendar quarter, is that like roughly the right math.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah, I mean we're - Tim, as you know we guide one quarter at time, we\u2019ll give you a little bit of color which is what Martin did, when he said a little more balanced than the 55\/45 and there's also reason I gave you the deferred revenue number, so you can think about how that likely transpires through the year. I'm not going to guide the third calendar quarter or the fourth, but I think we've given you enough to model it pretty closely.","Martin Anstice","Maybe just kind of two things to add quickly. I think our outlook today at least would cause us to believe that the December quarter is our weakest shipments quarter of the year, so that's kind of one extra data point. Another one is just kind of plain simple math of the disclosure that we've given, so the sum of our actual performance in our guidance today is the first half shipment of 4.9. You will I'm sure all make their own judgments about how much better the balance is than we previously described, but if you just use the math of 55\/45 proxy than the shipments for the year is approximately $8.9 billion and in a ramping year the revenues lack the shipment. So I think those numbers are the ones that we're kind of intending you to embrace.","Timothy Arcuri","Then I just had a question about the deferred revenue balance, Doug, which you were talking about before. I mean, you guys are now up to about 1.7 months, if I look into June, you\u2019re going to have about 1.7 months if you add Japan plus the deferred, you know, the regular balance. And it starts to look a little like the old Lam sort of in terms of backlog, not the new short lead time Lam. Is there a dynamic there, maybe you're shifting more new products or there's something happening in NAND and sort of - can you help us understand what sort of catch-up we should see because obviously you're going to revenue a lot more than you\u2019ll ship during the back-half of the year.","Martin Anstice","Yeah, it's pretty simple to think through this Tim, when you've got shipments that are growing the way we have the last several quarters, revenue almost always lags at growth and shipments. When shipments level off or if they were to decline sequentially, revenue will catch up, it's just a natural progression of the timing between with something shows up at the customer's dock and it gets into acceptance and revenue.","Doug Bettinger","But specifically is your question, Tim, as more kind of headline for us in terms of the timelines for ship to install and therefore acceptance of revenues. In any one quarter and you don't get to see this unfortunately, but the specific scheduling of shipments in any one week or any one day of any one month, I mean, that kind of jerks the ratios around. So there's is no real story here in terms of kind of changing dynamic of timeline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Patrick Ho","First off, in terms of your comments about a more balanced 2017 between first half and second half, is there any one specific market segment that's driving this better balance or is it a confluence of all the markets you mentioned in your prepared remarks?","Martin Anstice","Well maybe I\u2019ll break that into two parts. So what changed for us between this earnings call and the last earnings call, if you look at kind of the expansion in the business that we've reported and we're anticipating approximately two-thirds of that is in NAND space and a third is in foundry logic. So that would at least tell you that - to the assumptions we made and disclosed previously there's no real headline in terms of DRAM. So that would be the first part of the maybe the most helpful part of answering you question. Maybe I'll stop there, did I get what you wanted?","Patrick Ho","Yes, actually that\u2019s very helpful Martin. And my follow-up question maybe for Doug, in terms of the ramp up of shipments you talked about, you kept your supply chain at really optimal levels with inventory and even AR. What are some of I guess the nuances or the tricks that you\u2019re keeping the supply chain as tight and efficient as it's been particularly as shipments continue to ramp up over these last few quarters?","Doug Bettinger","I mean it\u2019s continued focus on just managing our remote factories, managing our own internal facilities, anticipating what we were going to need to be able to support at this point months and months ago and communicating that to our supply chain partners, Patrick. I mean it's operational excellence, the way Lam has always executed, just at a different scale here.","Martin Anstice","And just adding, I would say, honest hard work and when you hear us talk about our customer trust orientation, when you hear us talk about collaborative and partnership orientation that's pretty fundamental relative to sustaining your ability to perform and execute with the level of variability that is part of our business through the consolidation of our customers in the last several years. So our supply chain and our own factory and our field service engineers have done a tremendous job scaling in a very short period of time. And we continue to be proactive as proactive as we can be based on our visibility to ensure that investments are kind of made ahead of the need to support and service our customers. And competitively as best I can tell, we're doing just fine.","Operator","Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar","I have two of them, the first one for Martin. You're NAND shipments are at record high and 3D NAND spending is robust. I'm just curious if the pricing for NAND rolls over, will the reality of economics weaken and the 3D NAND makers might scale back CapEx or do you think the demand is strong enough to continue investing in capacity. Then I have a follow up.","Martin Anstice","Yeah, I mean I think you know one of our headlines obviously is there's a long way to go with the NAND story. And as I know you understand extremely well the economics of that device architecture are one of the most relevant parts to the penetration of SSDs and so on and so forth. So, I mean there's a positive for every negative. We see a long way to go, we see compelling demand drivers for that architecture and as we've described a number of times particularly in critical applications, the high volume manufacturing position of Lam in that inflection is outstanding. That's the best word that I could use to describe the position that we worked hard to achieve and sustain. So there's a long way to go and best we can tell, commitment to technology and sustainability to investment will go up and down along the way for sure, but long term, it feels pretty good.","Krish Sankar","Then a follow-up for Doug, Doug you mentioned in your comments that the headcount addition for new product development. I\u2019m kind of curious, is this because these new products you\u2019re developing, you don't have the core competency within Lam i.e. full wafer deposition or etch-related technologies and is it why you're hiring or am I just reading too much into it.","Doug Bettinger","Yeah, you\u2019re reading too much into Krish. I mean, any time you're doing more this year than you did last year you need more people to execute that, that's the statement around R&D. The biggest area of increase in headcount though Krish is, operations as well as the field who are shipping product real time and installing it at the customers facility.","Martin Anstice","And maybe just to add to that, let's kind of go back to disclosure of the last earnings call, because there's two stories in the company, one of them is the story of creating a road map of products and technology that was relevant for inflections anticipating how those inflections would have a concentration of spending for etch and deposition particularly. The second part of it was building the competitiveness of the portfolio we have so we get a bigger share of it and we gave two very important headlines in the last earnings call. One of them was the statement about how our foundry business grows and we characterized the growth in our foundry business year-over-year \u201916, \u201915 of 40% compared to a 25% WFE reference and we also stated that in NAND, we grow shipments by 80% year-over-year almost twice as the rate of WFE growth. So the headcount of the company is a lifecycle statement. So you add headcount when you prepare to do that and you add headcounts when you're in the middle of doing it and to some extent through the lifetime in an installed base business, the tail will demand at certain points, adding additional headcounts for many years to come and that's a natural commentary on the evolution of the company.","Krish Sankar","Got you. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys and great execution.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Farhan Ahmad","Thanks for taking my question. I had a question in terms of the sustainability. The year on year growth that you\u2019ve seen is quite impressive in the first half of this year. Now if I look back more recently since maybe 2010, the cyclicality of the business has gone down and that also implies that like year on year comparisons have not been that fair. So the fact that you're having too much growth right now, is that a concern in your mind in anyway and should that bring concerns of cyclicality back into the industry.","Martin Anstice","Yeah. In my opinion, no. I mean I might be wrong, but I think that there has been a fundamental transition in the industry as the supply chain is matured and as there's been concentration in the semiconductor industry. The traditional history of the industry was an over investment for many players and then a contraction. I think that's kind of long gone by virtue of scale and scope of the economics of the industry and the technical risks and opportunities to kind of go with it. But what is always still true is it's still difficult to predict and maybe increasingly so because there is no one kind of killer app or killer devices that diverse the demand drivers. It\u2019s more difficult to predict for our customers and therefore for us. There is some variability of spending and one element of our focus on competitive differentiation is business model flexibility and it\u2019s not actually that easy to ramp the capacity of your company by 40% to an average baseline of prior year. I mean that's a lot of hard work. The variability and flexible business model is a critical part of the success of the company and hopefully that will be a long term statement of value for our shareholders.","Farhan Ahmad","Thanks, Martin. And then one question on China. There's a lot of expectation around memory investment in China next year. The question I have for you is that from your perspective, has the visibility of memory projects changed for China for next and is that a part that you see for China memory investments next year without some foreign IP coming in to the picture.","Martin Anstice","Yeah. I think I'd probably say the same thing today that I've said for a while now and there clearly seems to be conviction to a plan that looks rational in terms of its kind of fundamental business objectives and your ability to execute as a byproduct of two things, knowing how to make the devices you want to sell and then having the operational scale to pull it off and whether that comes from M&A or IP licensing or just the developments of organic know how, I think we will see over time as best we can tell, we still believe that the China memory investment conversation is more a calendar \u201918 story than calendar \u201917 story and just to give you a little bit more color on the calendar \u201918 kind of holistically, we're tracking about 10 new fabs next year and to our understanding of the investment plans in those fabs, more than 80% of the wafer start additions will be not in China. So that's another data point that hopefully allows you to triangulate a little more.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Please go ahead.","C.J. Muse","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, on the fact you\u2019ve talked about service running at around 20% of revenues. As you clearly increased your installed base over the last couple of years, curious, has that increased and\/or when could we see an acceleration for that part of your business?","Martin Anstice","Well, I think whether it\u2019s accelerating enough, I'll let you decide. But at least for the last couple of years, we've had a pretty intense focus on broadening our work I would say to a customer. So advanced services agenda and a creative use of software, really employing strategies around machine learning and harnessing the data from the information that's available to us and to our customers in ways that create value, whether it\u2019s productivity oriented or extendibility oriented, there's a number of very meaningful projects. The business has been growing faster than the pace of the installed base and it continues to do so this year. And I would say we would expect the momentum in kind of the \u201918 to be stronger than \u201917 on that point. But it takes some time right and you develop new products and services, there's no magic depending on swing. It takes a number of years to really demonstrate and deliver the value and have the customer convicted that transition makes sense for them.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. And just as a follow up, when you think about the back half and I'm not asking for shipment guide, but as you think about mix and I think the takeaway from some of your comments earlier is that deferred revenues should help revenues exchange shipment from Q4. Curious how we should be thinking about gross margin trajectory in the second half?","Doug Bettinger","C.J., the guidance I gave you as you think to margin percentages, even though we\u2019re maybe not exactly on the financial model, we provided to you the margin percentages in the financial model are still good guideposts if you will in terms of how to model our business. So I\u2019d encourage you to go back and have a look at what we shared with you in November there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and solid job on the quarterly execution. On your view on better foundry and logic spend, of that incremental spending improvement, does it include a bottoming out of the number of customers relative to your prior view and is the incremental spend more leading edge 10 and 7 or more follow through on legacy 28 nanometer.","Martin Anstice","Most of the increment was ten at least compared and contrasted with our comments of the last earnings call and I don't know that our expectations for broadening are any different today than they were then. We expected there to be a number of customers making those investments and it's kind of playing out that way. Maybe one of the things I could have actually added earlier and maybe I\u2019ll do it now, Harlan, is when we look at our first half, second half, we believe that the first half memory is stronger than the second half memory from a shipments point of view and logic foundry is stronger second half than first half. So that's our view of kind of wafer fabrication equipment spending balance in the first half, second half by segment.","Harlan Sur","Thanks for the insights there, Martin. And then on the strong memory shipment environment, what we're hearing probably the same thing you guys are is that DRAM and NAND suppliers are kind of hand to mouth right, in other words, the shipping whatever they can build even always in the seasonally weaker March quarter, so I guess my question is, are you sensing more urgency to drive accelerated node migrations Whether that 1X for DRAM or 64 layers for NAND, I\u2019m just wondering if we're going to see a step up in node migration cadence just given the industry supply constraints.","Martin Anstice","Interesting question. I don't know if I would articulate a cadence message. I mean clearly there's a commitment to technology in conversions in memory and DRAM this year and that was a big part of the increments year-over-year from a spending and overall performance of the company. But I still don't think we're modeling any more than 25% of the installed base at the 1X node by the end of this year. So that\u2019s a reference there and maybe there's a statement on cadence, but there's clearly momentum and ambition to 64 layer devices. But if you look at the installed base of 3D NAND capacity at the end of this year, there's still a pretty broad mix of 3D capacity, right. So not only is there the reality that approximately half of the NAND installed base is 3D capable, there is the dynamic that some proportion of that 3D capable device is 32 player device capable, some proportion is 48 and some proportion is 64. So there's a long way to go with the installed base and supply chain, independent of the demand story.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sidney Ho","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a few questions. First is, there are some concerns that the second derivative of the 3D NAND wafer additions has peaked. Clearly, you had opportunity to gain share going from 2D to 3D, as you address the biggest portion of the market, but let's say the number of 3D NAND wafer addition next year is exactly the same as this year in 2018. How should we think about your revenue opportunity to NAND and technology or help you do better than what you did this year.","Martin Anstice","I have no idea. I mean it\u2019s such a precise question with due respect. I mean, the complexity of the customers\u2019 roadmap and spending, there are so many moving parts on that. I mean the best I can give you is that you got to take your own position on how much legitimate demand there is for 3D nonvolatile memory. We're pretty optimistic, but you make your own call on that. Whatever the level of demand that there is, Lam Research is going to perform better than the average equipment company maybe by a long way and that's the message we've tried to convey in terms of the criticality of etch and deposition in the device manufacturing process flow and it's the message that we try to articulate relative to critical applications, market share etch and dep at the 90% level. And it's the message that we've tried to articulate in terms of market share generally from plaintiffs to 3D which is almost a double digit gain in market share. So whatever it is, Lam Research is going to be a company in the mix of equipment companies that will be on the kind of upper end of the scale of performance as long as we keep executing in the ways that we have demonstrated in the last several years. I apologize I can\u2019t answer directly your question, but hopefully that context is helpful.","Sidney Ho","That's super helpful. Maybe switching to foundry and logic, in the past, you talked about yours and maybe in the dep etch clean opportunity goes up a lot every node, I think just comment on your share gains in this segment, but at the same time, TSMC, again, this is probably not new, but last week, they talked about the capital intensity probably stayed within pretty stable range over next few years. Can you help us square those comments and when it\u2019s going up a lot and when it\u2019s kind of flattish?","Martin Anstice","Yeah. I mean, obviously, the comments from any one customer are going to be WFE comments and the comments have come from the company, from us or segment specific, right. So our story is generally as you articulated in the microprocessor space. I think we've conveyed now for a couple of years a very different reality of engagement with the customer than was true five years ago and as I already noted again by repeating the disclosure of the last earnings call, our market share momentum in foundry has also been positive through the 10 nanometer and 7 nanometer transitions and all of that is true and supplemented by the fact that through the 10 and 7 and 5 nanometer technology roadmap, the proportion of SAM in etch and deposition systematically increases with the adoption of EUV that\u2019s I would say the consensus adoption assumptions and that's really a commentary on the progress that's been made in the economics of multi-patterning and it's a commentary on the insertion of EUR with a multi-patterning process flow and it's a commentary on probably 70% of multi-patterning integration schemes being spacer based. So there's a lot of kind of moving parts, but pretty positive story I think independent of the overarching statement that you've made and maybe one last point, logic and foundry are as invested as ever if not more so in utilizing their installed base and that will continue to be true for all of our customers.","Operator","The next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari","Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. Martin, I had a question on 2018. I realize we're early here, but \u2013","Martin Anstice","We lost you.","Satya Kumar","Operator, are you there?","Operator","I am. We will move on to our next question. The next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.","Atif Malik","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on good result and guide. Martin, you were a keynote speaker at SEMICON China in March, I Just wanted to know if you're confident in domestic Chinese spending based on discussions in China is higher about the same than what was three months ago.","Martin Anstice","It's about the same and I would say as a context, I'm a keynote speaker in SEMICON conferences all around the world. So I don't read too much into, I happened to show up in China. So we continue to believe there's substance to their ambition. We continue to believe they're working really hard and as is true for our customers globally, our job is to support as best we can and that's true for every customer wherever they are.","Atif Malik","Great. And then as a follow up, can you talk about the image sensor market? In your 37 billion plus WFE outlook, how big is the image sensor opportunity and what are the trends you're seeing in that market this year?","Martin Anstice","Yeah. I don't know Atif that we've quantified it specifically and I don't think we're going to today. What I would tell you directionally relative to last year is it\u2019s stronger this year than it was last year, probably not as strong as it was the year before, but we're seeing nice momentum in image sensor and it's a very etch and deposition intensive process and our position is strong. Our share position is very strong. ","Operator","We\u2019ll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Weston Twigg","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, just wanted to ask about DRAM. You said your outlook hasn't changed much for this year yet, but I'm just wondering as you look out in to 2018, big growth is pretty hard to come by, are you expecting some of that positive view on 2018 to come from DRAM capacity expansion in fabs?","Martin Anstice","We're not assuming much of anything in terms of increased wafer stocks I would say in DRAM just as a general modeling statement and I'd say that for 18 as much as they would \u201917 and maybe even \u201920. I mean I think our long term model is basically kind of flat lined wafer stocks in DRAM. The spending is all about technology conversion. Generally speaking, the demand statement is all about content more than units of any one device and there are some really interesting kind of demand opportunities for our customers and clearly there are some rumors I would say at various points in time around speculating of increased investments if and when our customers start articulating that, then obviously we're well positioned than we would participate naturally in that as strongly as we have in our past.","Weston Twigg","Okay. That's helpful. And then secondarily, just looking ahead on 3D NAND scaling, you\u2019ve talked about having good positions through 64 layer and trying to get good positioning for the 96 layer process, but just wondering if you're seeing a continued push for increased layer height from customers or if they\u2019re finding the scaling challenges are limiting then, you'll see them sort of double up on string stacking doublings layers of 64 or 48 for example.","Martin Anstice","Yeah. I mean I think the industry is at a still and customers specifically are still working through the answers to those questions. From a traditional scaling point of view, vertical scaling point of view, I mean we have customer engagements that extend beyond the 96 layer. So we\u2019re actively working with customers of that layer count in its element environment and as is true, if a customer can continue the same integration scheme and same equipment selection and the same materials, they\u2019ll work really hard to do that. So I think if the solutions that exist technically work for people from a productivity point of view, then it's much more likely to be a continuation of the same trend. But the industry is just beginning its transition to 64 layer device architecture and there's a lot of learning ahead of the industry. So I see both scenarios potentially playing out with an overwhelming bias to stay with vertical scaling as an architectural choice just because it's the lowest risk path normally.","Operator","And we have another question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari","Yeah. Thanks. Hopefully, I don't get cut off this time. Martin, I had a question on 2018. I realize we're early here, but when you think about the multiple growth opportunities you're exposed to, what are you most excited about into 2018 and on the flip side, what do you worry about the most?","Martin Anstice","I'm really excited about where the electronics industry is generally. I mean, from my perspective, I don't know that in my 16 years of this industry and this company, I'd be more excited by the diversity of kind of innovation and opportunity for the silicon roadmap. I think it's just tremendous time. And if you're investing consistent with that opportunity, you've got a nice future ahead if you can kind of keep executing and solving very complex technical problems. So I'm really excited and that's a very holistic statement on some pretty compelling diverse -- device diverse application technology drivers that are relevant to cloud and enterprise and mass storage agendas as well as the advanced computation agenda that is necessary to really harness the value out of a connected world. So I mean that's the excitement for me. None of that can happen without a silicon roadmap. So that's pretty cool. What am I most worried about? I am not worried about that much if I'm honest with you in the long term. I mean you've got to keep executing and this is a hard industry. We have to work really hard to do what we do. So our focus and our intensity around operational execution is something that takes a lot of hard work. The macro is an unknown and uncontrollable and hence the focus on flexibility and variability in our business model and the technical challenges don't get easier, but I feel like the technical depth of our company is one of our strengths. ","Toshiya Hari","Okay. Great. And then I had a follow up on the logic business. I was a little bit surprised how low system shipments were in Q1 or the March quarter. In the past, you\u2019ve talked about the CMOS image sensor business potentially picking up off of a low base in 2016 and you've also talked about some market share or potential market share gains in the microprocessor space going forward. So when should we expect the logic segment of your business to pick up meaningfully from a shipment and revenue perspective? Thank you.","Doug Bettinger","I\u2019ll give you a comment, Toshiya. I think March is probably the low point in terms of what the calendar year looks like from a system shipment standpoint in the logic and other, it\u2019s going to strengthen through the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you. In terms of NAND, I think you're talking about little bit of a higher percentage of wafers on 3D at year end. I think you said 700,000 before and now saying a little over half, which I think is north of 750. Is that incremental supply do you think or am I being too literal about that or is that sort of more conversion from plaintiff to 3D?","Martin Anstice","Actually, on the fly, I don't know that I know that there's a particular bias one way or the other. It was and continues to be at least in terms of wafer starts to pretty balanced year between kind of new greenfields and the conversion, maybe slightly more conversion, but it is pretty balanced. And certainly our expectations at the end of calendar \u201917 for shipped capacity in active qualification mode kind of similar to the level that\u2019s going into the year. So no real story in terms of supply and demand imbalance.","Joe Moore","Okay. And then where do you see the end point on that mix. You have these fully depreciated planar fabs, do you think there's a long tail on that capacity or will you see conversion to either 3D or to DRAM over time?","Martin Anstice","Yeah. I mean, the customers obviously are most qualified to answer that question. As best as I can tell, there was an intended conversion of the majority of the installed base over a period that runs probably four years from now. And that's without kind of the conversation around the secular demand trends and what that means for kind of bid growth and so on and so forth. So I believe if we're sitting here in four years\u2019 time, there will still be some planar installed base, but it will be a minority.","Doug Bettinger","Will be very small, Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Romit Shaw with Nomura Investment.","Romit Shaw","Yes. Thank you. Doug, I heard you just refer others back to the financial model from November. But back then, you had a basically a 2019, 2020 target of 26% operating margin on like 8.5 billion to 9.3 billion in revenue and this quarter, it looks like you're going to be run rating at the high end of that range and operating margin is going to come in per guidance at about 27%. So with all due respect, the model does feel a little bit stale and I guess my question is if we're to assume that LAM can get to 10 billion annualized at some point in the future, how do we think about operating margin?","Doug Bettinger","Yeah. Romit with all due respect, 27 and 26 isn\u2019t wildly different. So me guiding you back the model is a place that you ought to gravitate towards. I don't have a model out there that's a $10 billion model, Romit, but if there was one, it probably would be better profitability than the $9 billion model. There is leverage in the model. You've seen it from us as we've grown and I would expect that you would continue to see it if we were to grow beyond the high end of what I have out there right now.","Romit Shaw","Okay. The other question I had was just on the decision to do an accelerated buyback, just given the strong share performance and the potential for repatriation, can you guys just talk a little bit about timing here?","Doug Bettinger","When we announced the buyback, it was $1 billion program, $1 billion buyback over a 12 to 18 month timeframe. As we executed through it, I felt like getting into the June quarter, we needed to step up the pace a little bit to execute to what we said we're going to do and that's what we're doing and why we're doing a little bit more in June. And yet Romit, I wish I'd done it a quarter ago when the share price was lower, but hindsight's always 2020 with stuff like that.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. Most of the questions have been asked. I have two follow ups. Going back to your Analyst Day presentation, specifically on 3D NAND, you were saying that the 96 layer 3D NAND should start being investment for 96 layer 3D NAND should start sometime in late 2018 early 2019. Should we expect another round of bakeoff for that particular node? And if that's the case, is that going to happen early \u201918 and I have a follow up?","Martin Anstice","Well I think the reality of frankly the entire industry, not just NAND is, if a customer can keep doing what they're doing which is a commentary on materials and device architecture and process flow and equipment selection, they have every interest to do that because that's where the learning is and these are hard problems and challenges. So that tends to, not that any one of us are isolated from the competitive realities of life. But once you have high volume manufacturing positions and you have a learning that other people do not, your positions are generally very strong. So there is nothing extraordinary about the 96 layer structure in terms of how the customer will sink through and select equipments and we have the strongest high volume manufacturing position in the segments of our industry. So it doesn't mean we don\u2019t have to work hard, because we do. But we feel confident about the future of the company and the trajectory of our performance we've described to you.","Mehdi Hosseini","And a quick follow-up for Doug, you have above $18 net cash per share, how much of that is onshore versus offshore and what are your plans for the cash that is offshore in case there's no change to taxation?","Doug Bettinger","Mehdi, we finished last quarter, I think it was probably about -- maybe a little bit about 30% onshore, so about 70% offshore. Whole question around tax reform and when or if or what have you obviously is very topical and feels like every day, it's a little bit different. We're very much taking a wait and see approach, now whether or not to be any tax reform, there's a variety of different ways you navigate through that. But I'm more encouraged today than ever that we're actually going to get something done.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Mr. Kumar, I turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Satya Kumar","Yes. Thank you all for joining us and that concludes the conference call.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation.

Good afternoon everyone. And thank you for joining us today. In recognition of the competency capability and effort necessary to repeatedly deliver record levels of performance. I'd like to begin today by extending by sincere thanks to the employees of Lam Research, who strive tirelessly to meet commitments made, and built competitive advantage for the company. Defined by the substance of our culture, we are intuitively predisposed to find ways to contribute to the success of our customers through the delivery of innovative technology, trusted productivity and speed to solutions. It is in this context that we continue to be very pleased with the fundamentals and the trajectory of the company and are more inspired than ever by the long -term growth outperformance opportunity. Thank you, all. ","At is customary, I will now review our March quarter accomplishments, highlighting the multiyear outperformance drivers and their relevance to our strong results and guidance today. We will then summarize our 2015 outlook for wafer fabrication equipment spending and conclude with some updates on our strategic focus. ","The March quarter concluded with results generally in line with our expectations above mid point for all guided metrics. This represented our seventh consecutive quarter, a greater than $1 billion in revenues and was the highest yet reported levels of revenue shipments and operating income, each showing double digit growth from the same quarter last year. The delivery of this performance, we believe is a strong endorsements of our culture and values. The commentary on levels of customer trust and the validation of our ability to scale effectively. The combination of a strong March quarter and a stronger next quarter guide. And a perspective for there is some uniqueness to the market dynamics for Lam, provides the company opportunity for a strong second half. ","We continue to believe our performance is the result of increasing levels of trust and support from customers broadly. Markets that are sustaining, sustainability growing faster than the average WFE baseline, a differentiated Lam product and service offering which when deployed in a true partnership with customers, are together facilitating the technology inflections of multi patenting, treaty device architecture and advance packaging. These inflections are at the core of semiconductor scaling, critical to our customers and to their customers' success as they respectively perceive competitive differentiation with higher performance, more power efficient and more cost effective devices. We believe that inflection spending continues to raise proportionately tracking to one third of WFE this year and reaching the 50% level in 2017. A view point that remains a major influence over our confidence in achieving multiyear growth outperformance.","The multi patenting and 3D device architecture inflections are now well recognized as being etch and deposition intensive making likely the segment grow faster than the market for the next several years. This represents opportunity and risks both but the continuous strengthening of our product portfolio creates a growing SAM. The headline today is we now compete for 28.5% of total equipment spending and that number we believe will exceed 30% by calendar 2017. Lam's opportunity to outperform continues to have upside through market share gains. We previously reported a greater than 50% inflection based market share headline and further achieved applications defense and penetration performance so far this year above expectations at the 90% success level. Both data points reflect good momentum against our three year market share target of 4% to 8% increase in deposition market share, 3% to 5% in etch and 5% to 10% in clean . Over the last several quarters, we have talked about the success of our vector ALD product with a targeted tripling of business this year and an equivalent increase in breadth of customer engagement. Growth in our ALD presence well primarily driven by multi patenting application is being augmented by the successful expansion of our product to other applications such as high expect in ratio liners and image sensor devices. Our momentum in this fast growing market segment is enabled by our technology which is delivered with the productivity necessary for high volume manufacturing adoption. In conductor etch; we continue to extend our leadership with the most comprehensive product portfolio in debt development capability. We are extremely pleased with the market adoption for our latest generation Kiyo etch products, illustratively we recently secured another critical 3D NAND conduction etch position at a leading device manufacture and as a result, the Kiyo product addressing this market will now have more than double its install base in the first half of calendar 2015. This type of success builds fundamental capability and competitive advantage from demonstrated production performance. And it validates our conviction that for deposition and etch combined, we believe we have secured 90% of the critical 3D NAND's application selection so far made in the industry. We have long partnered with customers to demonstrate the value of our Kiyo with hydro technology which allows for localized fine tuning. Significant benefits are being seen for patenting and CD sensitive applications, the differentiated on wafer results are accelerating adoption of this unique and well patented capability. Tactically as we have stated many times, we don't win or defend everything successfully, but if we continue to more than not our momentum builds, strategically we recognize that our greatest areas of growth opportunity remain in dielectric deposition and dielectric etch, accordingly we prioritize investments and engagements to realize that vision. ","Now turning to our industry update. With the first quarter of 2015 concluded in line with our expectations and disclosure by companies in aggregates more or less consistent with our planning assumptions, we maintained our general outlook for WFE investment. The predicated trends in semiconductor consumption including demand at the leading etch, the value proposition of technology investments by our customers and the well established spending discipline, we believe together supports a growth outlook. The perpetual environment of change, pull and push, real and perceived is not new. Our focus on achieving long-term success a key guiding principle. We believe that the fundamentals remain strong for our company. This is an opportunity rich environment where our long-term commitment to customer trust across all market segments and all active technology nodes combined with a vigorous pursuit of technology leadership across our full and product portfolio never more important.","In the DRAM segments, we see disciplined investment strength across multiple customers, notwithstanding the well publicized weakness in PCs. Market demand continues to be driven by mobile and enterprise DRAM growth, DRAM investments which have appear p4 biased to the first half of 2015 are very efficient, and focused primarily on technology conversions to 20 nanometer.","For NAND memory, we believe that it will remain a healthy balance in overall supply and demand. We still anticipate that investments will include play and conversion and 3D NAND capacity addition in 2015, with the 3D investments being more second half weighted. At this time, we project 2015 3D NAND investment to be slightly greater than planar. ","Overall, we anticipate 2015 memory WFE spending at or slightly above the $15 billion level. For the foundry segment, we continue to see that investments in 2015 are focused on FinFET enablement at a number of customers as they compete for opportunity in their market place. The previously noted 28 nanometer classes of additions are occurring as anticipated. Our view of foundry investments is slightly lower than the spending levels we saw in 2014, again reasonably distributed across the industry and the year. ","We expect logic spending of between $6 billion and $7 billion more or less flat with 2014, reflecting a sustained commitment to technology conversions with optimized reuse of the installed base. This downward market pressure is offset at some level by mobile demand driven spending within the image sensor segment. Bottom line, we continue to model 2015 WFE at $34 billion, plus or minus two for the year. As we highlighted last quarter, execution on our current opportunities continually increasing customer trust, building strategic alliances with key customers, profitably growing the business and preparing for the next set of technology inflections are areas of strategic focus. Our commitments to R&D is the most fundamental element of sustaining outperformance for the company and as such we target to allocate more than 60% of operating expenses consistently to the delivery of innovation, fundamental research and concept feasibility evaluations, seeking to optimize both short term performance with our ambition for long-term sustainable growth. ","We continue to realize the benefits of that focus in atomic level processing and control in deposition and in etch both which effectively leverages our established strength providing a credible and we believe executable technology roadmap for the future. As we continue our journey of growth, 2015 is a year which in many respects solidifies and expands upon our successes of 2014. It is the year where we target to build competitive advantage through an intense focus on execution. We are pleased by our performance so far, but believe our opportunity and potential are greater. We aspire to strengthen the foundation of success and ensure that our most enabling vision objective to make Lam Research a place where successful people want to work, is a long-term competitive advantage that builds with intensity and drives value for the full community of stakeholders. Doug?","Doug Bettinger","Thanks, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you again for joining us today. We are very pleased with our results for the March quarter. A quarter where we achieved record levels for shipments, revenue as well as operating income. Each of these items grew double digits sequentially. We delivered performance above the midpoint of guidance for all of our metrics and delivered earnings per share above the guided range. Execution from the company was clearly very strong in the quarter. Shipments for the quarter were $1,497 million, which was up 20% sequentially and again near the high end of the guided range. I just point out this was the fastest sequential shipment growth in the last seven quarters. Memory shipments continued to be strong in the quarter with the combined memory segment making up 67% of the total system shipments compared to 53% of the prior quarter. DRAM shipments represented 45% of system shipments which was up from 43% in the prior quarter. And NAND made up 21% of the shipments which was up from 10% in the December quarter. ","The foundry segment was flattish sequentially in dollar terms accounting for 24% of system shipments. And I remind you that foundry in the December quarter represent 32% of system shipments. And finally the logic and other segment were slightly down contributing 9% of system shipments. And while we don't normally comment on bookings, this quarter I just mentioned that as we ended the March quarter, the book-to-bill was comfortably above one. We delivered record revenue of $1,393 million in the March quarter, an increase of 13% from December. Gross margin for the period came in at 44.7%, again towards the high end of our guided range. Better utilization from the factory and field in addition to a slightly more diverse customer base up gross margin. Also helping was the fact that we made solid progress in improving the manufacture ability of some of our new deposition tools. And as we shared before our excellent gross margins are a function of a number of factors such as business volume product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter. ","I'll remind you that our financial model is still the best way to think about our ongoing performance in the longer term. Operating expenses in the quarter grew to $345 million but decreased 2% as a percentage of revenue to 25%. Spending was above the midpoint of the implied guidance primarily due to an increase in profit depended expenses during the quarter. R&D spending increased sequentially while SG&A declined. We continue to drive our spending profile to have an increasing portion of our operating expense in R&D versus SG&A. R&D represented a greater percentage of total OpEx in March compared to last quarter. These R&D investments are critical to preparing for the current as well as future technology inflection center industry. ","Operating income in the March quarter came in at a record level of $277 million, up 20% from the prior quarter. Operating margin was 19.9%, up from 18.7% in December and again at the high end of the guided range. Operating margin improved sequentially as we delivered leverage from the growth in revenue. The tax rate for the quarter was up slightly is expected to 11%. The tax rate of middle teens remains the right level for you to include your models. The March tax rate was a little below the normalized level due to more income generated in lower tax jurisdictions as well as a provision to return true-up. Based on share count of approximately 174 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter were $1.40 above the high end of our guided range. The primary drivers of this being the higher revenue and the above mid point gross margin. The share count at this point includes dilution from all three of our convertible notes with the total dilutive impact being 12 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. And I'll remind you that the dilution schedules for the 2016, 2028 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. During the quarter, we spent $112 million and took delivery of about 1.4 million shares at an average share price of $78.45. We also returned $0.18 per share in dividend distributions. At the end of the quarter, 11 months into our two year program, we had completed about 55% of the current $850 million share buyback authorization. ","Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Cash and short term investments including our restricted cash increased notably in the quarter to $4.1 billion. We decided to take advantage of what we perceived to be a favorable interest rate environment and completed the issuance of $1 billion in principal value of investment grade senior notes. The issuance creates some flexibility for the company on a number of fronts. One of those being something I mentioned in last quarter's call. We have the first of convertible notes maturing in mid 2016 and we plan to use a portion of the proceeds from this issuance to refinance those notes. Cash from operation was $191 million which was up from $161 million in December. This cash generation ended up being a little better than I foreshadowed last quarter due to a little bit more linear shipments during the quarter. Day sales outstanding increased by two days to 68 days. Cash generation was partially offset by our capital return programs as well as capital expenditures. We exited the quarter with deferred revenues up $485 million which was up from $374 million in December. And I'll point out that this excludes $45 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments remained as inventory on our balance sheet. Company non cash expenses included $33 million for equity comp, $40 million for amortization, and $31 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $32 million which was down from $61 million in the December quarter. CapEx in this business can at times be lumpy due to the timing of certain investment programs. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,000 regular full time employees. ","Now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect shipments of $1,600 million plus or minus $50 million. We expect continued strength in memory and slight growth in both foundry and logic. Revenue of $1,460 million, plus or minus $50 million. Gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. Operating margins of 21%, plus or minus one percentage point. And finally earnings per share of $1.46, plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 174 million shares. And given we just issued new debt, I'd like to provide you some guidance on how to model the P&L impact from the 2020 and 2025 senior notes. On a quarterly basis we anticipate the incremental interest expense net of interest income and the tax impact to be between $4 million and $5 million.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I will now like to open up the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Thank you. We will take our first question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. ","Jim Covello","Great. Thanks so much guys, good afternoon and congratulation on the terrific results. Martin, when you made comments about the industry environment, I thought you emphasize the word in aggregate there has been no change. Obviously there has been a couple of high profile cut. Your use to the word an aggregate there and the fact that you haven't changed the overall result suggest there maybe some other-- some other customers that are actually spending a little bit more than they suggested earlier in the year. Is that a fair way to interpret your comments? ","Martin Anstice","Yes. I think that's fair, Jim. And the use of the word aggregate was deliberate. I mean one of the kind of reality is obviously when we're opining on what's changing in the industry outlook. Each of us have a baseline and just occasionally those baselines are the same, and just case they are different, sometimes we are anticipating announcement, sometimes we are not. But what has changed quite clearly is we've seen the public disclosure from the logic and foundry space that I think is well understood in the Industry for us, we've got some pretty kind of positive and meaningful offset in logic in or around image sensor application opportunity so that's kind of an offsetting positive. And the memory investments in 3D NAND is little stronger than we had anticipated in the second half. So I think now we've gone kind of three sequential earnings scores with slightly better outlook in 3D NAND so if you back up two we said we thought planar ","0:24:59.0 was greater than 3D NAND. Then we said that we thought they were about the same. And today we said we believe 3D is slightly stronger than planar investments in the calendar year. So that's go little bit better. And in DRAM, the investment level is probably slightly higher than we anticipate it, but I would have say this slightly more efficient because the balance of conversions got slightly stronger and you remember the odds which we talk about in DRAM really not technically as because they are just a compensation of the consequence of technology transition. So we had some foundry and some kind of micro processor negative, we had some image sensor, some 3D NAND and some DRAM kind of positive. And at the end of the day, our WFE number I think is within $200 million or $300 million today where we estimated to be in January.","Jim Covello","That's incredibly helpful, thank you. And if I could ask for my follow up, on the 3D NAND side, would you characterize that strengthening in the back half being driven mostly by one customer or is it a little broader than that? Thank you.","Martin Anstice","I think it is pretty distributed, Jim. I have a sense at this point that everybody is kind of invested in the substance and the reality and the benefits of the transition and the investments are recurring at a difference pace obviously from one customer to another. But as best I can tell everybody is describing an ambition to have HVM capability in calendar 2016, which means they are investing in a meaningful way in the second half of this year to accomplish that objective. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you very much. Guys, I wanted to ask a question about 3D NAND, and sounds like it is a little better than what you thought during the back half of the year. But you said last call that you thought you add about 70k, not you but the industry would add about 70k, I think going from 60k last year up to 130k closing this year. Does that mean that 70k is gone up a bit?","Martin Anstice","I think that number is not a bad reference point today, these numbers are when you are talking about additions they are pretty big numbers for 5,000 or 10,000 wafer stock. So I am not sure I would extract a very meaningful headline today in terms of number of wafer stock. Similar commentary today. I do think that perhaps our view is that there is maybe 10,000 wafer stocks of capacity shipped in but it won't be kind of productive and installed by the end of calendar year. So we probably have revised our outlook in terms of what will be in process being qualified. But it doesn't play role at all in terms of supply and demand balance in the industry. So it is same message more or less. ","Timothy Arcuri","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then, Doug, you said last call, you said that the bottoms up forecast was at the time, implying that -- technically, that the first half looked a little bit better than the back half. But now given that June is in fact that much better than what you thought at that time, do you still think that the first half, have we just pulled into the first half, or is the annual number in fact better than what you thought it was at this time last quarter?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Tim, as you know in this business you don't have perfect clarity in the second half when you are siting here at the end of March. But our expectation is as Martin described a strong second half. There are may still be a slight bias to the first half in terms of shipments, it is probably not loss on you that deferred revenue this quarter such that there might be more balance in revenue than shipments but honestly we are going to guide one quarter at a time. Still a bit early for us to give you definitive visibility in the second half but little bit of color anyway. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. ","Weston Twigg","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on DRAM piece. Given that DRAM pricing falling and PC demand has been quite soft this year. Do you have confidence that this spending plan will hold up in the second half? I guess may be you can give us waiting just specific around DRAM first half, second half? ","Martin Anstice","Yes. It is little dangerous to say we are like really, really, really confident gives life doesn't ever work as exactly as you anticipate it. But I do think the headline of discipline in the industry that we talked about a lot now is a valid assumption for the rest of the year. I think the entire supply chain is invested and accomplishing that objective. None of us get excited about wild swings in the volumes of our business. And frankly one of the things that doesn't make me feel good today, the only kind of primary change that we are talking about today in DRAM is that they got more efficient. So it is a slightly bigger number of investments but the value delivered from those investments in the industry is greater than we originally anticipated because there is now a greater proportion of investments assigned to conversions than we originally kind of thinking. So that's a very positive headline from my point of view regarding sustainability. And let's not forget that even with the pace of investment we are describing here, by the time you get to the end of calendar 2015, probably two thirds if not slightly more of the installed base has yet to be upgraded to the 20 nanometer technology node. So that's and I think a multiyear sustainable statement. ","Weston Twigg","Okay, that's very helpful. And I just wondering on the R&D line, big step up in the March quarter. On absolute basis do you think R&D stays around that level or it just varies as a percentage of sales in there to keep it in that range? ","Doug Bettinger","It will hold steady, we said that revenues little stronger in June, total spending will tick up slightly less but it is probably in a pretty steady state level through the next quarter or so.","Weston Twigg","Percentage wise or absolute dollar wise or both I guess to the year maybe. ","Martin Anstice","Absolute dollars","Operator","Our next question comes from Credit Suisse, Farhan Ahmad.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is for Martin, in terms of the 3D NAND, DRAM particularly as you look to next year, how do you think the spending between the planar and 3D would be for next year? Is it fair to assume that maybe close to 90% or even more could be 3D NAND? And secondly as you rethink about spending mix between conversions from planar to 3D and 3D new capacity how does that affect your business? Just to -- you mention like from DRAM the conversion being stronger resulted in a lot high revenue for you, I would imagine like if there is more portion of the spending going to conversion, spending on deposition and etch would be lot stronger? ","Martin Anstice","Yes. I would say at jumbo [ph] level and it is kind of segment unspecific. The more efficient the spending for the customer the more sustainable their investment is and the more likely they are to be successful. So we actually in general are very positive when we see conversions and upgrades. Specific to the first part of your question, while I am not trying to that I could apply on a percentage per se for 3D NAND but I definitely think it is the majority of spending next year. And as best I can tell most of the plans of the customers is not Greenfield. Their existing facilities and their conversion based and the implications of that to while research are very good because 3D NAND transition is deposition and etch intensive as you know and so we care about sustainability, conversions are very good. And whether it is new or conversion the debt on ex component is going to be disproportionately and positively a big feature of that spending.","Farhan Ahmad","Thanks, Martin. And just one question on the linearity of CapEx this year. Some of your peers have talked about foundry spending being kind of flattish through the year while DRAM is mostly first half faded. I just wanted to hear your thoughts like if you are seeing similar trends. ","Doug Bettinger","Yes. I don't that we got kind of perspective to that much different from the rest of the industry. So I think we kind of more or less aligned to grow up to that message. ","Operator","From Evercore ISI we have C J Muse. ","C J Muse ","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question when I look at your results implied in your first half guidance, can you comment on whether you are pulling in here your talking model for 2016, 2017 that it actually may absolutely come to fruition in 2016. I would love to hear your thoughts on that. ","Doug Bettinger","Yes. C J, I am not ready to update the financial model. You should expect to hear an update from us when we get to our investor event at SEMICON. Obviously, I feel good about what we are tracking relative to that model but I am not ready to give you any update today. ","C J Muse ","Okay. Sure I guess maybe as part of then when you think about the right parts of the market that you lever too, what do you principally drive your outperformance, attribute your outperformance in the first half? Is it memory exposure, is it share gain in LDH, is it double patenting, would love perhaps rank order of what's driving this relative outperformance near terms and then perhaps looking to the back half of the year with 3D ramp, NAND ramping what the key drivers look like there?","Martin Anstice","Well, the memory component obviously features in a pretty meaningful way as communicated by Doug's segmentation comments on March quarter and on the June outlook. Right so in terms of rank order first half of the year, there is a very strong message for us there. But the outperformance commentary from the company as a by productive kind of three inflections we've talked a lot about right so multi patenting, 3D device transition in memory and logic both and advanced packaging, these are the reasons we said we would with execution outperform and these are the very same reasons that we are outperforming. They are real and our focus is execution. I mean you heard me say in my closing that intensity of focus on execution here is kind of everything because we have at least by the decisions of customers set ourselves up for a greater than 50% market share of inflection based business. And as long as we execute that the story for the company is extremely positive. And so we got a little bit of kind of momentum on that obviously from a memory point of view in the first half relative to our model, it is clear and we talked about it several times, we are growing the company a little faster than we had originally anticipated in large part because of the multi patenting transition that we are accelerating particularly in DRAM earlier and faster than we originally modeled. And we are working really hard to make sure all the profitability of that growth kind of plays out consistent with our models and that's the reason why we don't change this model more than kind of once a year. So I feel really good about our growth and there are a lot of people in Lam Research really busy making sure growth is profitable. ","Operator","And our next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. ","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much and also congratulation. First off, in terms of 2015 and your comments about planar NAND versus 3D NAND and seeing I guess seeing the pick up and improvements on that front. Do you see any potential shifts in dollars from original plain or NAND investments that are not going to 3D, or has your number basically stayed static on planar or NAND or you are just seeing more 3D NAND in the second half?","Martin Anstice","We have tweaked less planar conversion than we originally anticipated. But our assessment today has been in overall NAND WFE investment is greater today than we anticipated in January. So there are some adjustments but the dollars of investment today we believe are higher than we anticipated in January. Just a little bit, Patrick. ","Patrick Ho","Great, that's helpful. And maybe Doug on the financial side. There has been a little bit of discrepancy that's gotten a little bit larger between shipments and revenues over the past few quarters which does give you a little bit of visibility on the revenue front. However, is that more related to new tools that are getting after in the field that takes a little longer in revenues, or is this something different on the accounting side that we should be aware of? ","Doug Bettinger","There is nothing different on the economic side. It is a little bit of new tools. It is also the fact that we are shipping this to some new fabs and it can sometimes take little bit longer to get the acceptance in that situation. ","Operator","And our next question is from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin","Thanks. Hi, Martin, Doug also congrats on the execution. I also have a follow up question on 3D NAND. We've heard recently from some of the customers giving updates on the 48 pair for 3D NAND. Do you think the second half is also perhaps benefiting from 48 pair 3D NAND being significantly more capital intensive than perhaps 32 pair NAND was last year? ","Martin Anstice","May be we need to remind everybody we are actually not a NAND memory company. I guess we have perspective but our perspective is never as reliable as our customers on this point. It is a little hard frankly to applying on capital intensity from where we sit. We have a very good visibility to deposition and etch and indeed a 48 pair has more intensity of deposition and etch than a 32 pair and 60 have more than 48 and so on so forth. Now performance benefits and yields all have to kind of play out for the substance and validity of those plans to kind of emerge. So we are not really articulating a headline today that I think is the byproduct of the number of pairs and a device changing from our expectations in January today. I think more we are articulating that some of our customers have made to kind of some changes in their plans a little bit around the balance of planar and 3D investment. So I think that's more the message than the kind of layer account.","Stephen Chin","Okay, thanks for sharing that. And then just a follow up question on the operating expense trends going forward. Now that some of these key inflection technology program, seem like they are well underway at customer such FinFET and 3D, can we think about Lam's OpEx spend normalizing a little bit lower -- or there are the big projects like FinFET and 3D that have come down to pipeline that we just don't know about. ","Doug Bettinger","Stephen as always in technology you have to be innovating your capability such that you are growing revenues two years down the road. The right way to think about the level of our spending, I would encourage you to go back and look that financial model that will answer the question for you. ","Operator","It is comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. ","Harlan Sur","Hi, good afternoon and congratulation on a very well executed quarter. On your memory spending outlook for 2015 going higher this year, can you just breakout the rough mix DRAM versus NAND spent within that memory view? ","Martin Anstice","Yes. I can if I get a slide in front of me. Okay, here we go, so we have today an assumption of between kinds of I would say 8.5 and 9.4 DRAM. So you can answer the NAND's question. There is a little bit of other memory but 8.5 to 9 is our assumption on DRAM. ","Harlan Sur","Appreciate that Martin. And then for Doug, team is looking for solid 80 basis points of gross margin improvement here in June. How much of that is due to a more diverse customer base versus some of the cost improvements and new tools that are starting to ship. And given your pipeline and product visibility, does the buyer suggest that you can kind of maintain this sort of 45% plus range as you move to a stronger second half over the year. ","Doug Bettinger","Yes, hi, Harlan, it is pretty evenly split in terms of the sequential improvement gross margin between tool maturation one which is about manufacturability as well as the slight running out of the customer base. So it is a little bit of both. Relative to expectations beyond that, again the reason I point to the financial model it is how we are thinking about the profitability of the company and how we are trying to run the company. So we are kind of in the sweet spot where you would expect us to be. If you go back and look at those model so this probably steady as you go for the most part.","Martin Anstice","So I mean we feel really good about the growth in the company. Hopefully that's kind of clear, we are working really hard to make sure we get the profitability expansion that we were targeting and the most stressful point as we talked about many, many times is the gross margin percentage is still one which is a very, very, very hard thing to execute to because you have kind of competing influences in terms of introducing kind of technology as fast as you can possibly get it to the customer and at the same time maturing it, so that in HVM buy in a high volume environment, the economics are where you want them to be and that's a really tough thing to pull off. And the long-term success of the company is more important than short term success. And our customers have high expectations of our industry that contribute to their business and so we are really focused as Doug just said on the long-term financial models that we've given you and we feel really good about growth and we are working really hard on profitability. ","Operator","And our next question is from Mark Heller with CLSA. ","Mark Heller","Thanks for the question and congratulation also on a good result. Doug, I was wondering if you could may be just give more color on the end market breakdown for June. I know you said memory would remain strong but can you give maybe some little bit more color on the percentages? ","Doug Bettinger","Yes. I am not going to give you the hard percentages. As I said memory will remain strong so that's plus or minus what we did in March likely and I said I expect logic and foundry both be sequentially stronger. I am not going to get into quantifying it specifically but that's a directional body language on it.","Mark Heller","Okay. And then obviously cash flow generation is really been excellent. I was wondering if you could -- is there any target that you have for calendar2015 and aside from the debt refinancing which I think is for next year, what are the other expected uses of cash. Could we see a dividend increase or another buyback?","Doug Bettinger","Well, we are not changing the plans of the company as we sit today. So I told you we are 55% of the way through the two year buyback authorization and we are about like end of the quarter we are 11 months into it, so that's got a ways to play out, I described part of that debt that we raised targeted towards refinancing the 2016 convertible notes. And beyond that our priorities for cash are first the profitable reinvestment of the business. We are absolutely committed to returning cash to shareholders. I don't have an update for you on the program that we got in place. And then you got to invest in CapEx and the business as well. So that's how we are thinking about there.","Martin Anstice","The only thing that I would add is relative to we kind of target for cash from operations, we don't really and we kind of pulling out there for you guys but clearly the operating income performance of the company is a decent proxy in the long term for our cash from operations performance. And in practice when it is higher or lower that's much more to do with the direction of the industry and the company than anything else. So if business volumes are in a positive direction i.e. growing at the end of this calendar year then we will be much more likely investing in even more growth and so may be you don't drive cash from operation as strong as your operating income if the reverse is true then you drive better cash from operations. So that tends to be how we think about it over a multiple year horizon, the operating income percentage is a good proxy for us in terms of cash from operations performance. ","Operator","Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citibank. ","Atif Malik","Hi, thanks for taking my question, congratulation on good set of numbers. Martin, what if anything is different about equipment reuse especially at foundries migrates from 20 to 16 and down 10 nanometer. And if you can talk about either your end markets or any other end markets which are more prone to equipment reuse? ","Martin Anstice","Yes. I would say I mean historically the markets where reuse is featured significantly have had limited number of kind of dye in a fab and align and so microprocessor fab and memory fab have historically been kind of the perfect models of equipment reuse and our customers get better at that and we get better at supporting them and frankly it is in everybody's best interest in the long term that we are able to kind of execute collectively consistent but as it always the case there is two sides to every coin and one of the reality is as an equipment company is the profitability level measured by percentage of profitability is often greater on kind of the conversion the upgrade than the original equipment sale. And so you get a smaller dollar but you get better kind of leverage in terms of the percentages. In the foundry space specifically I would say where you have a really big customer with a much focused demand requirement in terms of the number of dye then you have an opportunity for reuse in ways that in a typical foundry with many customers and much dye you don't have. And we don't actually see any change today from the world that we anticipate it, maybe we were lucky or maybe we put a lot thought into anticipating it well but I think we've been saying for a year we expected the equipments for 16 nanometer foundry by to have 90% to 95% overlap with the 20 selection. There is a lot of reuse potential and our outlook today in terms of investments in foundry is just the same as it was before. Obviously, considering the recent announcement from at least one foundry customer. ","Atif Malik","Great, thanks, very helpful. And then in response to James' question you mentioned the NAND, incremental NAND wafer start per month for this year you think that's 70,000 ballpark, could you also verify at the DRAM wafer start for this year are still in the 60,000 to 70,000 wafer start range? ","Martin Anstice","That's fine. It is about the same, Atif. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar ","I have two quick questions. Martin, the first on is when you look at your ALD product, looks like you are getting pretty good traction but my sense is you are not developing that many layers that you compete in today. Is there a potential to grow that with the existing product or do you need additional investments to get more footprint on the ALD product side? ","Martin Anstice","I think from a hardware perspective we are in decent shape, Krish, as is the case of hardware it gets you about 25% of the --results on the wafer and the rest of it is kind of process and the material integration. And so there is always a lot of work to do in terms of precursor development and then process to get uniformity and selectivity and conformality that we are targeting as a level of yield performance that make sense for our customers and I think we are off to a great start. We are coming from behind as you know in ALD; pick a momentum of the company I would say is very positive. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments today, we are taking kind of a very focused foundation and platform of growth and we are trying to broaden the applications now, but we have got tough competition and we respect their capability as I hope just a little bit they might respect ours. ","Krish Sankar ","Got it, that's very helpful. And then a question for Doug. What is your mix of onshore and offshore cash?","Doug Bettinger","We have to raise the debt, its cost kind of evenly balanced. ","Operator","Our next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.","Shawn","Hi, this is Shawn [ph] in for Mahesh. Thanks for taking my question. Just one quick question. Martin, DRAM spending has been very strong for the past two quarters and I think you mentioned that efficiency of the investment is betterment than anticipated. So at the beginning of the year when you initially presented the 14 to 15 bit in memory, you said that spending would drive about 30% of bit growth and then now with the improving efficiency do you think that pie in DRAM will be higher that 30% you mentioned before?","Martin Anstice","Yes, I mean I don't think that we have a position that is different from the industry on bit growth in any segment of the industry. We try to kind of triangulate as best we can and the high 20s and kind of 30 levels is I think where the industry is. And I think it is a very disciplined commitment by our customers. It doesn't serve anybody's interest for anybody to get ahead of this thing and you got a lot of discipline through consolidation. And capable as you know supply chain for that to continue. So I hope it does.","Operator","And our next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of follow up. Just want to clarify on the 3D NAND. You said that the dollar spending is a slightly higher than the planar NAND, and incremental capacity at is about 70, so does that mean that you still expect the NAND industry to be able to grow bit capacity by more than 30%? Or what I am missing here?","Martin Anstice","Yes. The answer is yes. ","Mehdi Hosseini","So more than half of the CapEx for NAND 3D and so when we look into next year as maybe some of our customers are start to reuse the NAND, should we assume some sort of a slight decline in capital intensity or do you think this kind of capital intensity is sustainable for multi year? ","Martin Anstice","Well, I think we are not a very representative competitive to answer that question because our participation in this inflection is a deposition and etch participation, that's a very kind of powerful place to be. But we don't really to get applying on capital intensity for the industry. I don't think there is another company in the equipment industry; they are doing much better job than us doing that. But I would say we are very invested in the opinion that our customers are focused on sustainability of investments and they are going to do at least as much as you might want them to do in terms of conversions to make it efficient and sustainable. So what is that mean for us? I think it means we are in the right place at the right time with the right products and if we execute we can continue to strength together some outperformance. ","Mehdi Hosseini","Got it. And then on image sensor, are these new customers or existing customers that have -- that are following new projects? ","Martin Anstice","Existing customers. ","Operator","And our next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham and Company.","Edwin Mok","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So on your comment about DRAM, spending more dollars on conversion for this year. Is that driving, is it a way you can break it down? Is it driving more incremental etch with deposition business for you guys?","Martin Anstice","Yes is the answer to that. But I think that's just kind of headline on the intensity of etch from a conversion point of view. It is a very favorable transition for us. And it is a commentary on the patenting transition in etch and deposition both. So we believe that the total wafer fabrication equipment investment in DRAM is a slightly higher than we thought, we believe it is more efficient to my earlier point and we believe it should stay for the second of deposition and etch. ","Edwin Mok","Okay, all right, that's helpful. And then on 3D NAND, I am curious, have you started to see shipment, or are you expect to start seeing shipment in the June quarter? And then sorry, a slide on an earlier question, in your ALD product that you talked about, is that tied to the 3D NAND investment, or is it all the inflections that you mentioned?","Martin Anstice","Let's try and answer the first part of your question. If your first part of question is 3D shipments, are they happening now or I mean they have been happening on a continuing basis. I mean there is always someone somewhere buying something for a 3D NAND application. So sometimes that's an addition to HVM capability sometimes that's a first phase pilot, sometimes it is second phase. I mean this four guys have different timing and different commitments to investment, but I think everybody is there as an industry. We have two more guys we are going to try and get to hear. So can we get to next question please? ","Operator","Our next question is from Sundeep Bajikar from Jefferies.","Sundeep Bajikar","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the foundry side. If you would just give us an update on the total amount of 20 nanometer, 16 and 14 capacities that you are now expecting to see exiting 2015. Are you seeing a bigger sift towards 14 and 16 rather than 20? Also if possible share with us how you are thinking about the progression of this capacity into 2016. Thanks.","Martin Anstice","Well, as I said before at least in the dialogues that we have for the customers we are not really distinguishing too much between 20, 16 and 14. I mean there is a huge amount of kind of overlap in terms of equipment. The basic message today we think is the one that was communicated to you publicly in the last couple of weeks that there is commitments to technology conversions and a little bit less today at the 14, 16 kind of node for the year from an industry perspective than was originally anticipated. But I think that the basic commitment to FinFET conversion first wave and then the pilot investment in 10 nanometer are there. So that would be my comments on foundry. And we are assuming by the end of this year that the capacity that has been shipped in at or less than 20 nanometer is in the range of 200,000 to 210,000 wafer stocks per month.","Operator","And our next question is from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Tom Diffely","Yes, good afternoon. First, a quick clarification. Did you say you had won 90% of the 3D NAND critical etch and deposition steps?","Martin Anstice","Yes. Which is disclosure by the way we made at SEMICON west a year ago. So I was really just kind of repeating that based on our assessment of critical and non-critical applications in that segments, we think the 90% headline that we communicated in SEMICON west is valid today. And in fact as I said in my prepared comments we had a nice kind of reinforcement of that in a selection this quarter. ","Tom Diffely","Okay. And then critical makes up what percent of the overall etch and dep for the 3D NAND?","Martin Anstice","We don't actually make that disclosure. ","Tom Diffely","Okay. Then finally when we look at the competitive front, are you seeing any increased presence with local vendors in places like in Korea and Taiwan?","Martin Anstice","No. I would say it is very kind of constant competitive threat and I don't think it is anything new. The reason by the way I said we don't disclose it is because the value of the critical position is much less to do with the percentage of the business. And it is a reasonable percentage; otherwise I wouldn't bother telling you. The value proposition of the critical win is you create cycles of learning for your company that your competition does not have. And if you do that long enough then your ability to be successful broadly in a market place is greater than their. So it is -- value is not the percentage, the value is the learning and the critical feature and capability that we developed broadly in the market place. ","Audrey Charles ","All right.

A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found today in today's earnings press release.","This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 PM Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per firm and a brief follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","And with that, let me hand the call over to Martin.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Thank you, Satya. We delivered another record quarter, highlighted by over $3 in earnings per share and reported for the first time in the company's history nearly $5 billion in cumulative shipments in the first half of the calendar year. Shipments, revenue, profit margins and EPS were all well above the midpoint of our guidance range for the June quarter.","In this context, I would like to thank sincerely our customers for the opportunity to contribute to their success, and our employees for their dedication and hard work, making these achievements possible. We will first start with a short update on near-term demand trends, add some context to the drivers behind our success over the last several years, and frame the exciting and sustainable opportunity we believe the company has going forward.","As a brief headline, since our last earnings call, DRAM and NAND demand-driven spending both have increased our expectations for calendar 2017 and calendar 2018 company performance. We have continued investing in capacity and flexibility for business success. Our operational execution and performance we believe continues to set a competitive standard in our industry. Demand trends are robust, particularly in memory both in enterprise and consumer end markets.","Applications such as machine learning and artificial intelligence are foundational to the next generation of technology innovation, and they are driving strong memory content growth for DRAM and NAND that offer attractive economics for our customers. The substantial density increases made possible by 3D NAND are driving strong content growth for high-end smartphone devices this year. Combined, we see tremendous opportunity over the next several years for robust, non-volatile memory growth in consumer end markets driven by innovations such as AR\/VR, 5G, automated driving, robotics, and other IoT applications.","We continue to be very enthusiastic about the opportunity for a silicon-enabled, comprehensive global technology and applications revolution. With these trends, memory-supply-demand balance remains tight, and our memory customers are on track to generate record performance, with memory industry revenues in 2017 poised to exceed $100 billion for the first time ever.","Consistent with this demand-driven growth, our customers are planning incrementally higher capital spending levels both in DRAM and NAND. Underscoring our belief that spending levels are demand-driven and sustainable, memory industry capital intensity is on track to remain stable at approximately 20%, consistent with long-term averages and well below prior cycle peaks of 30% to 35%.","Non-memory spending plans remained strong and essentially unchanged versus our prior expectations with a primary focus on technology inflections. Overall, industry WFE spending is now tracking above the high end of the previous range we provided. And we currently maintain a positive view on a strong customer spending environment once again in 2018.","The improvements in WFE this year have led to increased Lam performance expectations for the calendar year, and now a relatively balanced outlook for our shipments first half to second half. Worthy of note, our full calendar year shipments are on track to significantly exceed the rate of WFE growth once again in 2017. Related, having previously highlighted the potential for calendar year shipments slightly below $9 billion, we now target slightly below $10 billion. This is a commentary of increased strategic relevance and effective scaling, also a commentary on the competitiveness of the right products and services at the right time.","As we target this new milestone of slightly less than $10 billion in annual shipments for calendar 2017, I would like to take a moment to reflect upon an incredible journey, a journey that provides the context for Lam's ability to continue to drive long-term, sustainable and profitable growth for all our stakeholders. 10 years ago, Lam was a single-product etch company with an addressable market of 10 to 15 percentage points of WFE that was itself a highly cyclical and relatively low growth market, very leveraged to the PC.","With solid strategy, execution and support from our customers over the last 10 years, we succeeded in several important ways. We built Lam etch market share to an unmatched technology and market share position deep-rooted in our leading-edge capabilities and our commitments to partnership with our customers. We transitioned from a single-product company to a diversified multi-product and services company, extending from etch leadership into clean and the deposition markets. Combined with a strong focus on identifying and positioning ahead of key technology inflections in semiconductor device manufacturing over many years, we have added over 20 percentage points to our addressable market, which now exceeds 35% of WFE.","Additionally, while further strengthening our leadership in memory, we have diversified our revenue exposure through a strengthened position in logic and foundry market. And notably, our customer support business group through its innovative products, advanced services and productivity solutions continues to deliver growth at a pace that is greater than our installed base unit growth.","Expansion of our served market and market share, combined with solid execution that delivered unmatched multiyear growth and value expansion, is the financial headline of Lam. But perhaps what is more important relative to sustainability of value creation is customer trust and the increased strategic relevance of Lam products and services to the success of our customers. As a statement of relative performance, we believe the opportunity for Lam is compelling.","With a very strong foundation, I believe we are today entering another exciting phase in our evolution. Data is the new currency of the global economy. The collection, storage and analysis of big data to produce artificial intelligence and machine learning has the potential to change nearly every industry. This trend, we believe, is leading to sustainably higher demand for memory spending.","Indeed, memory capital spending has grown at a 20% CAGR over the last four years, about twice as fast as the growth rate of overall industry CapEx. Our analytics endorse the conviction of our customers to the sustainability of bit density and diverse applications demand growth and the discipline of their investment. Lam technology and market leadership comes at a time when the semiconductor industry increasingly embraces vertical scaling as a key driver of performance improvement rather than simply traditional shrink.","Vertical scaling is certainly a sweet spot for Lam. We have the highest market share in etch and deposition markets combined of any market participant. Our commitment and investments in R&D and a disciplined approach to product pipeline and road map over multiple years, combined with a focused operational execution and rapidly growing installed base, provide a consistent feedback loop to further solidify our positions of leadership. We will talk more about the opportunities we see in vertical scaling at a special reception that the company will be hosting on August 9 at the Flash Memory Summit Conference here in California. Rick Gottscho, our Chief Technology Officer, Satya and I very much look forward to engaging with many of you there, as a preamble to our planned Investor and Analyst Meeting in a few months.","When we think about our future beyond the next several years, we believe our competitive and business strengths, our operating capabilities, and the environment around us, all combine to create tangible opportunity for Lam to further deliver long-term value creation. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and expertise in manufacturing, supply chain, and our sales channel, that each, we believe, are foundational to creating shareholder value in all current and future market opportunities.","Our vision continues to optimize long-term and short-term success to the best of our abilities. Our vision continues to balance investing in the sustainable and profitable growth of Lam through the introduction of disruptive technology and incremental market offerings. Our vision is to realize full value from natural technology extensions of our company, and our vision includes an ongoing commitment to capital redistribution.","With that, let me turn the call over to Doug.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Okay. Great. Thank you, Martin, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon during what I know is a busy earnings season. We're pleased with the results we have to share with you today for both the June quarter and for our just concluded fiscal year 2017. So let me go ahead and just jump into the numbers. In the June quarter, we performed above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics. We delivered record levels of shipments, revenues, cash from operations, gross margin dollars, operating income dollars, and earnings per share for the quarter and for the fiscal year.","Each of these metrics achieved strong double-digit growth in fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year. We believe these results and milestones clearly demonstrate solid execution against our multiyear outperformance objectives. Our upward trajectory of shipments continued in June quarter coming in at $2.543 billion, which is up 5% sequentially and above the midpoint of the guided range. Shipments for the 2017 fiscal year were $8.586 billion, which was a 46% increase compared to fiscal year 2016. Memory shipments remained strong with the combined memory segment making up 73% of total system shipments, which was in line with the prior quarter. Non-volatile memory accounted for 59% of the shipments, which was up from 50% in the March quarter. Demand for 3D NAND equipment continues to be robust with customers executing their plans for increasing layer counts and improving device densities.","DRAM shipments represented 14% of system shipments, which was down from 23% in the prior quarter. Shipments for foundry customers were 22% of system shipments in the June quarter, which was down a little from the 24% in the prior quarter. And finally, the logic and other segment accounted for 5% of system shipments versus 3% last quarter.","Revenues for the quarter were again at a record level of $2.345 billion, which was an increase of 9% compared to the March quarter. For fiscal year 2017, the revenues of the company came in at $8.014 billion, which was an increase of 36% compared to the prior fiscal year. Our installed base business contributed approximately 25% of our revenue in fiscal year 2017. The installed base now includes over 45,000 process modules, and with that growth comes an increasing opportunity to sell spare parts, upgrades, productivity solutions, system refurbishment, and other innovative product offerings.","We have solid momentum behind our objective to grow the installed base business faster than the growth of the installed base itself, which is an important component of the sustainable cash generation of the company. Gross margin came in above the midpoint of guidance at 46.5%. And as I've shared with you in the past, we expect variability in gross margin on a quarterly basis as a function of number of factors such as business volume, product mix, and customer concentration.","Operating expenses in the June quarter grew to $440 million, and that compares to $414 million in the March quarter. And of that OpEx spend, we increased the portion allocated to R&D to about 65%. We're very encouraged by the opportunities we see ahead of us and continue to make strategic investments in R&D programs over a multiyear horizon in support of our customers' road maps and plans.","Operating income in the June quarter was at a record level of $650 million, which was up over 12% from the prior quarter. Operating income grew at roughly twice the rate of operating expense, demonstrating the leverage we have in our financial model, and supporting our ability to make strategic investments to sustain our outperformance going forward. For the first time in the history of the company, operating income generated in the fiscal year topped $2 billion. Operating margin for the quarter was 27.7%, which was up from 26.9% in March and at the high-end of the guided range.","The tax rate for the quarter was approximately 13%, and that compares to 12% last quarter. A tax rate in the low to middle teens through the end of calendar year 2017 would be reasonable for you to include in your models. Based on a share count of about 182 million shares, earnings per share for the June quarter came in at $3.11, which was near the high-end of the guidance range. This share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes, with a total dilutive impact of about 18 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. And I'll remind you that dilution schedules for the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. And I would just mention that with the increase in our stock price, we have received requests for early conversions of our 2018 and 2041 convertible notes totaling about $300 million. These requests will settle in cash and shares and are comprehended in our September outlook.","We returned $587 million of cash to our shareholders during the quarter; $74 million in dividend distributions and $513 million in share repurchases executed largely through a $500 million accelerated share repurchase. The ASR terminated shortly after the close of our June fiscal quarter on June 30. Inclusive of the ASR, we have now completed about 70% of our current $1 billion buyback authorization, and we have repurchased 5.3 million shares at an average share price of $135.55.","Now let me transition to the balance sheet. Cash from operations was very strong at $729 million, which was up from $423 million in March. For the fiscal year, the company generated over $2 billion in cash from operations. During the quarter, cash and short-term investments, including our restricted cash increased to $6.3 billion, which was up from $6.1 billion in March. The increase in the cash balance was obviously the result of the cash from operations that we generated offset largely by the capital return program that I referenced. Days sales outstanding improved to 65 days versus 69 days last quarter. Inventory turns were 4.1, down slightly from the 4.2 we saw in the March quarter.","At the end of the quarter, deferred revenues were $966 million, which was up from $842 million in March. This number excludes $397 million in shipments to customers in Japan that will also revenue in future quarters. This Japan number was $260 million last quarter, and recall that these Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on our balance sheet. And I'll just do the math for you. The combined deferred bucket now stands at over $1.3 billion as we exited June.","Company non-cash expenses during the quarter included the following: $44 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization, and $40 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $35 million in the quarter, which was down from $44 million in March. We exited the quarter with approximately 9,100 regular full-time employees. The growth in head count was in the factory and field, in addition to the R&D organizations.","Now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We expect shipments of $2.350 billion plus or minus $100 million, and as Martin mentioned, we are expecting a roughly balanced first half to second half shipment profile. We expect revenue of $2.450 billion again plus or minus $100 million.","As we sit here today, we expect that December is likely the high point for both shipments and revenue in calendar year 2017. We're expecting gross margin of 46.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point, forecasting operating margins of 28% again plus or minus 1 percentage point, and finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $3.25 plus or minus $0.12 based on a share count of approximately 183 million shares. We're obviously pleased with the financial performance of the company that we reported and guided today. And we believe we're well-positioned with our portfolio of products and services to successfully pursue the opportunities ahead of us.","Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Martin and I would like to now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. And we'll take our first question today from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. You talked about memory is the driver of the upside to your outlook here. And just curious if you could put some numbers around how you're thinking about WFE for both DRAM and NAND this year and next? We would love to hear your thoughts there.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I think I'm not sure we have that much to add frankly to everything that I've seen, written, read by analysts or other equipment companies. And frankly speaking, the primary purpose of this dialog is to talk about the economics of the company, not the industry. So, what we've tried to articulate, C.J., is an enhanced view of performance this year, so the slightly less than $10 billion shipments reference is an important one, and that embeds in it a commentary on SAM expansion and share growth. And we have opined on kind of the sustainability of spending and a strong kind of outlook for calendar 2018. But as is customary, I like to take a shot at putting a quantitative reference at the beginning of the year and one at the end, and let other people have their moment of glory in the middle.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Let me ask another question then. If I look at what you discussed in terms of shipments and revenues for the full year, it looks like you're going to outgrow WFE roughly by 3 times. And I guess, that's pretty outstanding outperformance. What's the encore next year? How should we think about your relative performance and changes technology-wise that can sustain continued outperformance into 2018, 2019 and beyond?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I think we certainly have a view that the last five years and this year don't end at the end of this year. We're working really hard to make sure that there's an opportunity and demonstrated performance of sustainable growth and outperformance. And the best way to think about that frankly is to think about the commentary that we've made available around our product portfolio increasing its share of wafer fabrication equipment spending.","So that comes about from our own investments in new products and capabilities, and it comes about from what I believe is an unmatched positioning of this company to the totality of technology inflections in the industry, and it comes about through device architecture challenges \u2013 device architecture decisions and process flow decisions of our customers. So, we have provided a quantitative reference today that says above 35% of WFE is what we believe we're competing for, you have all of the disclosure, I think, previously on market share, and we see both trends as positive, not just in next year but in the years to come.","So, there's an ebb and a flow always on a short-term basis, but I mean we feel really good about long-term demand for silicon-enabled innovation. We feel really good about discipline in the ecosystem, and we feel really good about the unique opportunities for this company.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, C.J.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great set of results. Martin, can you just talk about the mix of spending between logic foundry and memory in the second half? The first half was very strong in terms of memory spending, do you expect the second half to be pretty similar in mix or do you expect a change?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. So obviously, there's some company disclosure, which is reasonable balance in shipments first half and second half. When we look at kind of WFE, I think, a more or less memory as an aggregated segment is actually also pretty balanced with kind of DRAM a little stronger in the second half and NAND was a little stronger in the first half. And similarly, kind of foundry and kind of microprocessor, other logic kind of balance themselves out as well. So foundry was a little stronger in the first half, and we believe microprocessor and other logic is a little stronger in the second half. So kind of all in, pretty balanced spending year is the one that we would assume today.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse","Got it. And then I just wanted to ask you a question about the overall services business. If I assume that that mix of business is pretty flat from last year, because I believe at the end of last year also, you had indicated that's 25% of the revenue. So the services business has grown at extremely fast rate at this year. Can you talk about what has driven that exceptional level of growth, which could be about 40% or more from last year to this year?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I mean it's inevitably kind of two or three things. One part of the growth of the installed base business, which is in spare parts and services and upgrades and refurbishments is the size of the installed base, and as Doug talked about in his prepared comments, the installed base has grown significantly in the last five years. So that's kind of baseline number one.","The second element of this could be \u2013 is the breadth of products and services that we've made available to the industry, and I think the industry's natural inclination to take a greater advantage of the full portfolio of productivity solutions. So, the installed base business, spares and service and upgrades and refurbishment is all about productivity, generally speaking. It's about making an installed base more productive, and as we've talked about for many, many years, as an industry, the technology challenges don't get any easier, but that's also true for productivity challenges. So, as we introduce advanced products and services focused on productivity and so on and so forth, that plays into the performance of the company. Last thing I would say is that as the technical specifications of device manufacturing are more difficult, that naturally also plays into an enhancement of some elements of the installed base support business.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse","Thank you. That's all I have.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Farhan.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Congratulations on another well-executed quarter, just solid all around. Maybe stepping back a bit and sort of looking at the end markets' supply and demand dynamics. We had two relatively big memory customers report recently. The CapEx outlook by both looks very healthy, and the view by both is on a go-forward basis, CapEx trends look good on a go-forward basis. That's also in line with some of your prepared commentary. But the market seems to be interpreting higher CapEx as new capacity, new wafer starts especially in DRAM. So it's raising some cyclical red flags here. Given your forward pipeline, your visibility, do you guys see any signs that there will be meaningful uptick in total DRAM industry wafer starts this year or next year, or is more of the DRAM spend focused on accelerating technology migrations on the installed base?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I would say to the best of our abilities, the answer to your question is no, we do not see meaningful expansion of an installed base. Clearly, compared to last year, the investment level in calendar 2017 in DRAM is significantly improved and enhanced. But I think a couple references for you. We do not believe that the installed base in terms of wafer starts of output is any greater at the end of this calendar year than was true at the end of calendar 2015. Statement number one.","Statement number two, when we look at kind of capital intensity of memory at the segment level and look at kind of DRAM specifically, it's a long way from kind of creating kind of the anxiety levels that we think would be relevant to kind of cyclical imbalance. Though we have the same conviction that I think is expressed by all, if not most of our customers, around disciplined investment, which doesn't mean it's perfect. I'm sure there's an ebb and a flow from one week and one month from one quarter to the next, but the fundamental headlines around content and density and demand and how that's playing out in terms of spending in a consolidated industry I think are pretty healthy.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the color there. And then on the installed base business, obviously great to see the continued growth trends there, very stable annuity-like business. I'm assuming that you guys are also driving leverage in this segment, maybe Doug, if you could comment on services' op margin performance versus corporate margins, are service op margins accretive to corporate average? And are you guys able to drive the same amount of leverage that you are for the total business?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah, no. It's a very nice part of the business model. It's very cash-generative. As I think I've indicated before, it's probably a little bit accretive to the operating income on a percentage basis. It doesn't have anywhere near the amount of investment that is required in the new equipment side. But what I really like about it, Harlan, is the broad base of it. It's got many, many, many engagements, lots of customers. It's just a very stable predictable business, and your characterization of an annuity is exactly right, it is a great part of the business model.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Congrats.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thank you, Harlan.","Operator","Moving along, our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon, and congrats on the strong results. I had two questions. First on the opportunity in China. If you can talk a little bit about some of the developments over the past couple quarters both on the memory side and the foundry side. Martin, if you can talk a little bit about how you view the second half of 2017 and more importantly longer term?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I mean, again I'm not sure I have kind of too much to say incrementally here. As we've said for the last couple quarters, we believe that China is an increasingly important part of the industry measured by the level of spending. Today, spending in China is dominated by the global player presence in China, but this is a year where there is a foundry, DRAM and flash investments by the domestic Chinese community.","And as is consistent with I'm sure every disclosure from every other significant equipment company, we're participating in that, as you might expect, and our presence and our plans in China are at least as good as our average, so it's an important region with an important focus for us. And we would still say today that the calendar 2018 is a bigger story than calendar 2017 for the kind of China. So, certainly that plays into our qualitative statements that we believe calendar 2018 is a strong year for the industry.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then my second question was on the logic business. Martin, I think you briefly talked about shipments being a little bit stronger into the second half relative to the first half. But longer term, obviously, this is a part of the market where you've historically been under-indexed, and at the same time you've talked about some wins at the 10-nanometer node. So, I guess from a timing perspective, when should we expect this part of your business to inflect to the upside in a more meaningful way?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I mean, I guess that it's always true that it shows upward revenues when customers spend money on the applications you've won. There's no pendulum swing here. This is kind of a multiple year transition, and we're super pleased about the progress, which doesn't mean it can't be better, and it doesn't mean our aspirations aren't greater than we currently have achieved. But we're walking towards an objective where the position of the company in logic is at least as good, if not better, than the position of the company in foundry and it will take a number of technology nodes to get to that point, and we're not there today. But I'm super pleased with our progress.","And the comments on logic and foundry, I mean I don't want to miss the foundry headline, which we talked about last year. The performance of the company in foundry last year against the average of the industry I thought was just outstanding. So, I think we reported 40% increase year-over-year compared to about a 25% assumption on WFE. So, it's going to take a couple of nodes to kind of fully realize our ambition if we're successful in all respects, and we're certainly working hard to achieve that.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","And Toshiya, it'll be stronger in the second half than it was in the first half for sure.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Congrats again.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thank you.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Arthur Su - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, this is actually Arthur on for Edwin. Congrats in a great quarter, and thanks for taking our question.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Sure.","Arthur Su - Needham & Co. LLC","Martin, I had a question for you on your natural \u2013 your comment on natural technology extension. So, some of your peers have talked about increasing metrology intensity going hand in hand with more complex 3D NAND devices. Given your leadership in 3D NAND, how do you think about your product portfolio in terms of metrology, does it make sense to offer metrology system under the same roof to provide a more comprehensive solution?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Didn't we try that strategy? You know, and I mean, I guess that wasn't at the heart necessarily of kind of the Lam and KT ambition. But it was an inevitable kind of part of that strategy. Today's kind of process control ambition, metrology ambition is really kind of defined around a couple of things. One of them is that the real-time process control kind of dialog and the second is the potential for some level of integrated metrology. So, we've articulated our ambition, I think, in terms of SAM expansion on that, and the second part of our strategy is to increase the competitiveness of our underlying etch and deposition and clean products by dealing with one of the most fundamental challenges of the industry, which is tighter specs and the need to open up device design and device manufacturing process windows.","So that's where our focus is. So, my comments around kind of natural technology extensions were intended to be a little bit more holistic than kind of metrology and process control. And really, this is kind of like not a new headline or new thoughts in the company. But I feel like consistent frankly with the trends of most of the industry participants, I wanted to make sure that everybody understands that we think holistically about how best to harness value from all of the assets and all of the strengths of the company.","And so, when we look at that obviously, our vision is to create sustainable, profitable and kind of accretive growth for the company. And by natural extensions, we mean focusing on kind of the assets and the strengths of the company as currently defined, with a requirement for kind of high confidence business plans and leverage in our financial models. So, it's an emerging investment for the company, it's still quite small, I would say. The investment by the company in products and services and markets beyond our core is in the $20 million to $30 million range probably for the year. But I think it's an important part of the long-term vision for the future of the company.","Arthur Su - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for that clarification. Just a quick follow-up question. ASML talked about the progress they've made with their EUV tool and the potential that it can address up to 15 layers upon insertion at 7-nanometer. Given your strength in etch and deposition, has that in any way shaped your initial view on your patterning opportunity, and do you believe that Lam is also well positioned to remain competitive due to improving economics of your multi-patterning processes?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah, I think that's a really good point. Actually I mean, every single day from us and every other participant is delivering litho multi-patterning schemes or spacer-based multi-patterning schemes, we're making the economics better. And to answer the first part of your question, the disclosures recently and the editorial hasn't changed our fundamental view of our opportunity. We still believe we have SAM expansion through the 5-nanometer technology node that we've currently kind of articulated in the Analyst Meeting.","We triangulate around public statements and private statements from all of the industry participants that all kind of talk to us. We feel like we have nice opportunity. We have decent strength, and that our focus is on controlling the things that we can control and making the best of it. So, nothing new to say, and one big part of the economics of the company quite frankly has been multi-patterning in memory and logic both.","Arthur Su - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Moving on, our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats again, guys, on another great quarter. I had a couple of them. Number one, Martin, if you look at the WFE spend on 3D NAND, obviously it's really healthy driven by \u2013 end demand is obviously greenfield, the yield's are pretty low, there's some conversion from 2D to 3D, kind of curious if any one of those vectors slows down, do you think 3D NAND can sustain in current levels, or are you worried about that going forward?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Well, I mean, I think the fundamental thing we look at is demand, right, which is not so much a unit conversation these days, it's a content conversation. And when you kind of look at this year and you look at the road map for smartphone content and service content particularly, I mean, I think that's the most important commentary around sustainability of spending because the spending, despite very critical and strategic technology transition this year, is predominantly defined around the importance of responding to demand and keeping supply and demand in balance to the best of our customers' ability, and as an industry participant, we're trying to support that.","So, when I think about kind of how they spend money greenfield or conversion 2D to 3D, or 3D scaling, as we articulated in our Analyst Meeting, we're actually agnostic to how they go execute. If you look at the unique elements of the Lam Research serviceable markets, there are pretty similar opportunities for us in both implementations.","And our view today is quite similar to the view we had a couple of months ago, more or less the 3D-capable capacity in NAND installed base at the end of the year will be approximately half of the installed base, which is not to say the transition is kind of half done, because in the context of the demand message and the technology road map for this particular inflection, I mean there's a lot of years of opportunity ahead of us, and we're certainly excited about participating and enabling to the extent that we can to the success of our customers.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then another question on the DRAM side, I think you did articulate the fact that you're not seeing a whole lot of capacity expansion, and clearly last year was a cyclical low for DRAM CapEx, and this year it's still below 2015 levels. Is it purely a function of the fact that the number of process steps is increasing as you go below 20 nanometers, it's more difficult to do, that's why even though optically it looks like CapEx is higher, it's not really as high as you think you'd expect it to be?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I don't know if we're completely qualified to answer the full scope of your question. I mean, I will tell you for our piece of the pie, yeah, and this is true in most every part of the industry, the investment in a given kind of wafer outs kind of goes up in technology inflections, and the trick for our customers obviously is making sure that the density in this case or the number of chips on the surface of the wafer goes up in proportion to the increase in kind of cost, and as I think is well-publicized to this point in time, the most challenging part of the semiconductor kind of road map from a kind of long-term perspective is DRAM. Although frankly speaking, there is kind of three or four nodes depending on how you define it in the road map that we have with customers in front of us today. By the end of this year, we estimate that only 25% of the installed base is actually at the 1x technology node. So, there's kind of a decent amount of sustainability and value proposition, I think, in front of the industry for DRAM.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Krish.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It's very helpful. Thanks, Martin.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much. Martin, first in terms of the capital intensity trend particularly for etch and deposition where we've seen growth in the percentage of the spend of those two areas, given some of the continued changing dynamics of the industry, do you see both of them continuing to increase maybe at a more moderate level, or does it assume flattened out particularly if EUV comes into play?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","So I think we've articulated as precisely as we can do in our Analyst Meeting, and I'd pull the slides and update the slides for the WFE assumptions that you think are most relevant, but we've articulated with the assumptions made that I think more or less is being reinforced by other disclosures since we made them, insertions in second phase of 7-nanometer and insertions planned in DRAM. Our serviceable market increases through the end of this decade and probably slightly beyond. So, on that one axis, as I've said, it's a nice opportunity for us and one where we continue to be very focused on.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. That's helpful. Doug, you talked about R&D being 65% of total OpEx. On a going-forward basis given some of the projects you have in hand, do you see that percentage potentially increasing as you keep kind of SG&A as flat as you can, or 65% kind of the right run rate we should be looking at?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah, Patrick. We're going to keep trying to drive that higher obviously. That's the good kind of spending that generates growth in the future. It's not to say every quarter it's going to be up, but on a year-on-year basis, the way we will manage and run the spending of the company will be to try to allow that to grow and still keep the discipline around the financial model in total, and by so doing, get more efficient in SG&A.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah, good afternoon. I have a question on the service side of the business. Is the strength that you're seeing there, is that also a reflection of 200-millimeter strength in the industry, or is that not a big part of that equation?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Well, it's part of the equation. Obviously, and I'd extend maybe that comment beyond the wafer size statement and kind of talk about the non-leading-edge investments of our customers as well. This is a year where, again, the investment levels in 28-nanometer and above for example are significant. And so, in the kind of so-called trailing-edge technology nodes and even 200-millimeter wafer fabs, as Doug said, we're engaged with a lot of fabs around the world, hundreds of fabs around the world.","And we're engaged in every active wafer size and technology node, and certainly in the scheme of IoT road maps particularly in the broad set of systems integration that is now kind of the reality for the semiconductor industry that the full spectrum of devices, the full spectrum of wafer sizes continues to be the focus for, as I said before, truly optimizing the value we deliver to customers and truly optimizing the value we create for our shareholders. That's another kind of version frankly of harnessing full value from the company and natural technology extension, bringing kind of expertise and wisdom that we've developed in 300 mm and making it available wherever we can.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah, and Tom, just to add on, as IoT takes off and these analog-y sense-y kind of devices proliferate, the trailing edge is going to be more and more important over time. So, not necessarily just 200 mm as Martin pointed out, but trailing edge capacity between 200 mm and 300 mm is something we're certainly very focused on.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Great. And then a follow-up, we're starting to hear a little bit more about some domestic OEM semi-cap players as well. Is there anything that changes the landscape as far as the competitive front goes?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","I'm not sure I understood the question, Tom, domestic OEM...","Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Just some Chinese domestic players.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Oh, it's China.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I don't think there's a headline of significance. We obviously respect everybody that we get to compete with, and with rare exceptions, the players that exist in China today have been players that have been there for some years. And we wish them well, but we do our best to excel in the markets worldwide including China. So, nothing new to articulate today.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. We're pretty good at doing what we do, Tom. We spend $1 billion in R&D. So it's hard to compete with that level of scale. Not that, as Martin pointed out, we're not paying attention to everybody and paranoid about everybody, but it's hard to do the stuff that we're doing.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Oh, thanks for taking the question. The first was just an operational question, Martin, to follow up on a point that you made that the company is getting to a $10 billion in annual shipment level, and congratulations on that milestone. The growth from $5 billion to $10 billion has been very fast, and the company's managed that very efficiently. As you look at the next leg of growth for Lam, what are the biggest challenges to maintaining the same level efficiency that you've had from $5 billion to $10 billion to whether it's $12 billion or $14 billion in shipments?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Well, the gray hair transition for me is done. So, now it's about losing hair, I guess, for the next transition.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","So, you get a little lighter.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","And I'm taking care of that for you, Martin.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","So, frankly speaking, I appreciate your recognition, number one, and your statement about efficiency, it's really hard to scale the company at the pace we are over a multiple year period. And I'll speak again to the employees and the suppliers and the customers quite frankly doing partnership kind of make all of this possible.","We take pride in the business model. It's a business model that has been in place for as long as I've been in the company, which is now 16 years I think. And business model flexibility in investing to create kind of capability and capacity to respond to uncertainty in the industry holistically is kind of what our focus is. And the three elements of that you've really got to kind of deal with in terms of variability are kind of factory, supply chain, and service. And what you do in parallel is make sure you never compromise your investment in fundamental research and never compromise your investment in concept and feasibility and product pipeline because that must kind of exist under any conditions if you're going to take seriously owning kind of long-term success to your company.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for that color. The follow-up is for Doug. Doug, you mentioned that you'll be working through the ASR, what are the priorities for cash and cash return beyond share repurchase under the existing program?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. So, what I said maybe not very clearly is we're about 70% through the current buyback authorization. We authorized $1 billion and announced it at our Analyst Day back in November. And I'll remind you at that point, we meaningfully grew the dividend as well. I mean, I would expect to give you a more definitive update when we get to that November Analyst Day. We're going to keep chugging along the current authorization, and it likely will be close to completion in the November timeframe probably, and at that point, I'll be ready to give you a more definitive future what the next leg of this looks like, but it's likely going to be a continued commitment to a meaningful return of capital to shareholders, how and what, in what amount, I'm going to save for November.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik - Citigroup","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Martin, if I look at your guidance here, you're probably around like $41 billion WFE run rate, couple of your peers at Semicon talked about $40 billion to $45 billion as kind of the new baseline for wafer fab equipment spending, understand you guys are positive on next year, would love to get your thoughts if $40 billion is kind of the new baseline for the next three years?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Well, I think as kind of Doug said in a conference kind of mid-quarter, we don't kind of not align to the types of statements being made broadly in the industry. We don't have kind of rationale to deliver you a different message. So, a number beginning with 4 is a reasonable kind of proxy. I think at the end of the day, sustainability is defined by two things. It's defined by the legitimacy and sustainability of demand, and we see a world of tremendous innovation in software and applications, which is enabled by silicon. And something really special happened in the last several years, and the special was the world of connectivity in cloud and advanced computation kind of showed up at the same time.","And so, there's, I mean, a tremendous amount of excitement around that opportunity. And it's much more difficult for us sort of forecast because it's not one device now, it's many. And it's not a unit conversation, it's a content conversation, but that's kind of the nature of the beast. So, when we look at the most fundamental part of answering your question demand, we feel very good about it, very excited about that opportunity.","The second part of this is all about kind of discipline and balance between supply and demand, and every indicator we have, whether it's supply and demand, statements from a modeling point of view, whether it's ASPs, whether it's inventory levels, whether it's reuse strategies, whatever it is. I mean, the datapoints that we look to continue to suggest much more discipline than not. And so, in the context of what I just described, with the assumption about stable units, an assumption about kind of continued content expansion, an assumption about the legitimacy of our China investments, we feel like there's sustainability to the types of spending levels that we're seeing right now. So, our view is, this is not an aberration. I'm sure it goes up and down along this journey, and we've all got a lot to learn, but it feels quite fundamental from the seats that we have in the semiconductor ecosystem.","Atif Malik - Citigroup","Okay. Very helpful, and as a follow-up, in the past, you guys have provided 3D NAND shipped wafer capacity, can you tell us a number for exiting this year?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I'm not going to tell you a precise number, because I don't think it's that much different than what we said before. It's clearly a little higher. But the fundamental headline, which is the one that I really care about, is the opportunity for sustainability of investment that comes from content, and there's some great content messages. And by the end of this year, to the best of our knowledge, about half of the installed base will be 3D device capable in various forms. So there's kind of three or four forms of 3D capacity, and there's a great technology road map with demand, and so that the opportunity is kind of a multiple year opportunity.","Atif Malik - Citigroup","Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Atif.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I have two questions as well, I guess. Maybe just starting on the NAND side, and understand the secular growth narrative that you guys have, I totally get that part. But I'm curious, as you think about the next few quarters there with all the 3D NAND supply that's getting on board, do you see a pause that occurs there, especially in the early part of next year as some of those capacity gets digested? And if 2018 is more conversions, less greenfield, does that have any ramification for Lam?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Well, on the last part of the question, the kind of greenfield versus conversion, there's almost no implications for Lam. We articulated a reasonably agnostic view of that in our Analyst Meeting. Relative to pauses, I think the industry now collectively, the actions of our customers and the action of their supply chain is now sufficiently fast. But the disconnects are kind of sometimes not even noticeable, and they're much faster than they ever were. So, are there going to be ebbs and flows of investments? Always, but I think much less wild swings than was through in our history. And I guess that's the kind of variability versus cyclicality conversations that we've had a number of times. So maybe there's pauses and accelerations, but the customers will do the right thing. They'll make investment when they have demands to support, and as a supply chain, we're running cycle times today that are fast enough that were collectively responding pretty well to their needs.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And I guess, if I can just follow up, at the Analyst Day, I think you guys laid out a financial model that talked about \u2013 I don't know \u2013 25%, 26% op margins, $10 to $11 EPS power, 2019-2020 timeframe, right? So far in 2017, at the end of this year, so you seem to be closer to $12 EPS run rate. So, should we think of Lam fundamentally during the high 20% operating margin and potentially higher if the WFE momentum sustains? If not, why should we think of margins coming down towards the mid 20%?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. The first thing I'd tell you is we'll give you new model when we get to the November Analyst Day, we're going to think through kind of investment levels and what that all looks like. If I were you trying to correlate those models to where we are today, I'd essentially run rate the previous model to level of spend you think is occurring this year. And when I do that back of the envelope map, we're probably, I don't know, a half to maybe a full percentage point on an op income above where those models would suggest, and whether we choose to spend a little bit more as we start looking at the numbers, I think we'll decide that as we go through it. But that's generally how I'd be thinking about it if I was you, Amit.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thank you for your time, guys.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Martin Anstice, at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. Thank you very much. So, I'd just like to say a couple of things in closing of today's call. The first thing is to say thank you to those of you that were complementary about the performance of the company and kind of recognized the journey and the accomplishments, because a lot of people worked really hard to achieve that, which is my second comment. And I recognize I made this in prepared comments, but I'd like to do it again now. None of this would be possible without the commitment and support of all of our employees in every function, in every location around the world, and people are working extremely hard to scale the company in the way that we are, and I extend that thanks also to the supply chain community that makes this possible.","And last but not least, to the really important stakeholder, the customer, because without the customer's partnership and support, we wouldn't be telling the story that we are. So, in closing, a big thank you to a lot of people, it's a privilege to be part of this company, and a privilege to have an opportunity to tell the story that we do.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today\u2019s call we will share our outlook on the business environment and review our financial results for the March 2014 quarter and our outlook for the June 2014 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed over the wire services a little after 1 PM this afternoon and can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website, along with the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call.","Today\u2019s presentation and Q&A will include statements about our expectations and beliefs regarding certain future outcomes including our guidance.

You can expect to see further details in the coming weeks on our Investor Relations website.","With that I will turn the call over to you Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thank you, Shanye and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll start today\u2019s call by sharing highlights from the quarter and then update you with a short commentary on the industry environment before concluding with our perspective on Lam\u2019s opportunities and progress against our growth objectives.","Then Doug will summarize our financial results and provide guidance for the June quarter. Lam Research is off to a really great start in 2014, hence we\u2019re pleased to report another quarter of strong execution across key areas of the business. We delivered great financial performance in the March quarter with results topping the mid-points of our guided ranges across all metrics and meeting or exceeding our long-term models in absolute terms as well as in timing.","Our business models are focused on driving profitable growth. Consistent with expectations we grew revenue by 10% sequentially and grew operating income nearly twice that pace with excellent cash from operations performance at 24% of revenues.","We are very busy with new technology and product release activities taking advantage of industry transitions and increasing support from our key customers. We continue to solidify to solidly gain traction across each of our targeted market segments and enjoy increasing market share in etch and deposition, both a claim recently endorsed by independent industry research.","In 3D NANDs production qualifications are underway for our high productivity dielectric deposition platform, our latest generation dielectric etcher and our tungsten extreme fill tool.","These transistors are defined by uniformally depositing alternating films using our PECVD system. Next these transistors are connected by precisely etching a very high aspect ratio down through the entire film stack using our dielectric etch tool.","Finally that hole is filled with tungsten using our CVD system which electrically connects the transistors in the device. Essentially from selections made by our customers every critical step in the all-important transistor formation in 3D NAND is addressed by Lam equipments.","In DRAM, contemplating our strong etch position in the area of multi-patterning we secured production application wins with our dielectric ALD tool for 20 nanometer technology node. Importantly we have demonstrated the ability to achieve our customer\u2019s stringent uniformity requirements without compromising productivity.","In the area of advanced packaging we were successful with two new systems, two new customers for our 3D copper electric planting tools thus extending our lead in copper fill. And in our clean business we have leading edge joint development activity now with three leading device manufacturers to evaluate our next generation clean system and we\u2019re pleased to report that one of these systems has been released for production for multiple front end line applications. While we\u2019re still in the early stages of assessing these tools production capabilities we are of course encouraged by our early progress and remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead.","We continue to focus on delivering technology and productivity solutions that enhance the value we offer to our customers. The ability to do so correlates directly to our long standing focus on unit process excellence, customer trust and industry collaboration leadership which we believe are differentiators of substance for our company.","This differentiation is more important and more valuable than ever in an environment which is being impacted by the scale of customer and the equipments industry consolidation at the same time that customers are demanding very best supports to their most complex and pressing technical challenges.","We believe the results we report today further illustrates how customers are demonstrating their commitment to Lam as a technology and productivity solutions partner for their most critical challenges and inflections.","Turning now to our industry outlook, we continue to forecast wafer fabrication equipment spending at approximately $32 billion in calendar 2014. The headline here is we\u2019ve seen some strengthening in DRAM largely with multi-patterning and technology conversion, some slight delays in 3D NANDs to our earlier expectations and a sustained commitment in logic and foundry to 20 nanometer and FinFET adoptions and multi-patterning integration schemes.","Starting with the NAND segments we saw very strong investments in the March quarter, both for Planar and 3D NAND devices. We continue to expect WFE spend for Planar devices will represent the majority of spending this year and remain relatively steady as customers transition to the sub-20 nanometer technology node.","Specific to 3D NAND the timing of second generation device ramps appears now more likely to extend into early 2015 for some. As a result we now estimate that the cumulative amount of 3D NAND shipped capacity exiting 2014 to be at the bottom end of our prior range of 80,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month. This shift has not impacted our outlook for 2014 NAND supply bid growth which remains essentially in the lower 40% range. In DRAM we saw an acceleration of investment plans in the March quarter to convert capacity to the mid-2x and 20 nanometer nodes. We expect similar DRAM investments to continue through the balance of calendar 2014, for Lam, more than offsetting the delays I just mentioned in 3D NAND. As a result we have maintained our projections for memory WFE spend in a range of $12 billion to $13 billion in 2014.","Finally, in both the foundry and broader logic segments our outlook remains pretty consistent with what we outlined in our January call. Although it seems there is a perpetual debate around pulls and pushes, the ramp plans for 20 nanometer foundry and 14 nanometer logic appear from our perspective to be progressing largely as expected through the first half of this year and we started to see initial pilot capacity installation for foundry FinFET.","Overall we estimate that approximately 25% of total WFE investments this year will be directly associated with inflection technologies including 3D NAND, FinFET devices for foundries, multi-patterning and advanced packaging. Our customers are motivated to transition to these next generation devices because they can offer a competitive advantage in their markets in cost and\/or outperformance. Again, based on the importance of these technology inflections and the current pace of pilot and production ramps we\u2019re still projecting overall WFE spending within a $32 billion range. We assume spending is relatively balanced between halfs with memory investments slightly stronger in first half and logic foundry slightly stronger in the second half of this calendar year.","For Lam, we believe we are well-positioned with these inflections and have the opportunity to outpace the industry growth once again in calendar 2014 as our customers begin to transition to these devices. More, if we execute to our plan this outperformance should accelerate as a greater proportion of total spending relates to these inflections in the next two to three years.","Further adoption of multi-patterning schemes is a sizable cornerstone of sustainable growth to the company. We are continuing to benefit from the ongoing investments in leading etch foundry capacity. However these trends may be most pronounced currently in the DRAM segments. With the transition to the 20 nanometer node, the number of multi-patterning passes increases from four or so steps at the 25 nanometer node to 15 or 20 steps at 20 nanometer. These critical applications play to our leadership position in conductor etch and have supported equipment bias.","We are already benefiting from the initial 3D NAND production bias and have further strengthened our development share positions which bodes well for the company as other NAND manufacturers commence technology transition to 3D devices in volume next year and beyond. In addition, LAM\u2019s exposure to each of the industry segments is more balanced today than ever in the company\u2019s history. In the last 18 months we strengthened memory positions for deposition products particularly NAND positions and ALD technology broadly. We have also fortified positions for etch in microprocessor and foundry both.","Noteworthy, across the sum of our product portfolio in calendar 2014 I believe our global market share in foundry is expected to be within five percentage points of our market share in memory. In addition, year-over-year 2014 versus 2013 our logic shipments market share, including microprocessor, general purpose logic and packaging is likely to increase by 10 percentage points, approximately two-thirds coming from deposition and one-third from etch.","At the end of the day we believe Lam exited 2013 having gains two to three points of ships market share in etch and point or so in deposition with essentially no change to our positions in claim. In a world that at times offers confusing or conflicting industry claims on growth and market share perhaps there is no more fundamental measure than relative revenue growth.","In that regards we established an industry benchmark in calendar 2013 with year-on-year revenue growth that outpaced the industry and all of our primarily direct competitors by a significant market. We are increasingly confident in our product positioning and particularly the support we are receiving from customers at this time. In addition to the beneficial deposition and etch market expansion opportunities available for the long-term, particularly with multi-patterning and 3D transitions we are poised to gain another one to two percentage points of shipped share in both etch and deposition this year.","Our strong performance within the quarter and outlook underscore Lam\u2019s unique value and growth opportunity we believe. We are executing at a high level and believe our customers are very invested in Lam addressing their most critical challenges long term. With that I will turn the call over to Doug.","Douglas Bettinger","Thank you Martin. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you today when I know is a busy earnings day for all of you. And I\u2019ll reiterate a little bit of what Martin said. We are starting 2014 with some very positive momentum. We continue to execute on our growth plans and to deliver solid performance very much in line with our financial model.","Shipments for the March quarter again hit an all-time high. We achieved record revenues for the fourth consecutive quarter. Operating income continued to outpace revenue growth this quarter by almost double the rate. Gross margin came in towards to the upper end of our expectations. Earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance and we clearly demonstrated the cash generation ability of our business model by more than doubling our operational cash flow on a sequential basis.","Shipments in the March quarter were $1.264 billion, which is up more than 10% compared to the December quarter and again above the midpoint of our guidance range. Memory shipments continued at a healthy pace. Relative to our expectations at the beginning of the quarter DRAM upside compensated for slightly softer NAND spending.","The combined memory segment represented 66% of total system shipments, about flat in percentage terms with the December quarter. Of that NAND shipments contributed 36% The build out of initial 3G NAND production capacity made up a large portion of NAND shipments in the March quarter. I would point out however that we still expect planar NAND node conversion spending to represent the majority of NAND investments for the full year.","DRAM shipments were 30% of system shipments. These shipments were targeted at 25 nanometer conversions and initial 20 nanometer pilot production. We are benefitting disproportionately in this area due to our strong market position in multiple patterning applications.","Foundry shipments were 28% of total system shipments, flat on a percentage basis compared to last quarter. However in total dollar terms up sequentially by nearly 15%. In addition to ongoing capacity expansion for the 20 nanometer node we are starting to see shipments for FinFET pilot production.","And finally logic and other shipments comprised 6% of total system shipments which was down from 8% in the prior quarter. Revenue for the March quarter was $1.227 billion, representing a 10% increase from the December quarter. We saw revenue growth significantly above 10% sequentially in both etch and deposition driven by share expansion in the memory space.","March quarter gross margin came at a little better than expected at 45.5% and again was in-line with our financial model. And I will just remind you that we expect to see quarterly variability in our gross margin performance based on multiple factors such as product mix, customer mix and business volumes. We continue to manage our operating expenses which were within expectations for the March quarter at $311 million. This spending was 25% of revenue compared to 27% of revenue in the December quarter.","We remain focused on driving efficiencies in SG&A in order to enhance funding for strategic R&D investments. R&D grew to 60% of total operating expenses in the March quarter while we slightly lowered SG&A expenses. The incremental R&D spending supported areas like the 3D copper electroplating, ALD and tungsten CVD that Martin mentioned earlier. We delivered solid operating income in the March quarter at $248 million, which was up 19% from the $209 million in the December quarter.","Our operating margin came in at 20.2% near the high end of our guidance range, again reflecting leverage in our model. The tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 12% .I expect the rate to hold steady in the low to mid-teens for the balance of the fiscal year. And the resulting earnings per share for the quarter came in at $1.26 exceeding our expectations. Majority of the upside is attributable to our operating performance and to a lesser extend a more favorable tax rate.","Our earnings per share were based on a share count of roughly 172 million shares. The share count includes the dilutive effect of 6.8 million shares from the 2041 convertible note. And let me just remind you that the schedule for this note is posted on our investor relations website to assist you with your modeling.","We generated very strong cash from operations in the March quarter at $290 million which was about 24% of revenue. Our operational cash generation more than doubled from the $129 million in the December quarter due to a very strong focus on collections [Technical Difficulty] repurchased approximately 930,000 shares of common stock. At year-end we had completed about $186 million or approximately 75% of our current $230 million authorization at an average cumulative share price of $15.19. We are anticipating share purchase under authorization in near term. You should expect us to update you on our long plans in this area as we complete this authorization. We remained committed to a prudent return of available cash to our shareholders. So now let me turn to balance sheet.","We ended the quarter with gross cash and short term investments including our restricted cash of $2.9 billion. This compares with $2.7 billion in the December quarter. We had deferred revenue of $432 million which does not include $57 million of shipments to Japanese customers which will convert to revenue in future quarters.","Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect shipments of $1.150 billion plus or minus $50 million. We expect revenue of $1.240 billion plus or minus $50 million. Our expectation for gross margin is 46% plus or minus one percentage point. We are forecasting operating margins of 20% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally we forecast earnings per share of $1.21 plus or minus $0.07 based on a flattish share count of approximately 172 million shares.","Based on our current outlook we expect our shipment profile to be relatively balanced between the first and second half perhaps with a slide bias towards a little bit stronger first half. We are seeing a slight pause in shipments during the middle part of this year. Consistent with the prior remarks we would expect variability quarter-to-quarter given our consolidated customer base and the ongoing uncertainties about the scope and timing of investments for next generation devices.","Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Martin and I would be pleased to take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Farhan Rizvi \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is for Farhan asking the question on behalf of John. I was just wondering like you talked about your multi-patterning opportunity and it seems like there is a huge growth for you going from 25 nanometer to 20 nanometer. I wanted to know relative to the previous guidance that you have provided at the analyst day, how do you see your SAM growth in terms of percentage on a per wafer basis when you go from 25 nanometer to 20 nanometer DRAM?","Martin Anstice","Yeah, we don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t actually kind of get to precisely answer that question in the context for SAM expansion of the company obviously includes the DRAM transition but there is kind of much more to SAM expansion than that but I guess at a very high level, if you look at the inflection in DRAM from the mid 2x node to 20 nanometer we would expect SAM expense in the 30% to 40% range. And a big part of that obviously relates to patterning and as best we can tell and I think today\u2019s results are a decent amount of evidence so that the share momentum for the company is positive. But the headline I would ask you keep in mind is that inflection sits in the context of 4 or 5 and the total SAM expansion opportunity for the company is in a $1 billion range.","Farhan Rizvi \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it and thank you. And then talking about the shipment mix in terms of your June quarter, how do you see different mix by different segments?","Douglas R. Bettinger","Yeah, I mean obviously regarding this is Doug by the way, we are guiding shipments down a little bit. Within that your memory is down a little bit, NAND probably down and DRAM is actually flat to slightly up. Logic is up a little bit and foundry is flattish, may be flattish to slightly down.","Farhan Rizvi \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. That\u2019s all I have.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Great guys good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Can you talk a little bit about the breadth of the DRAM activity is it just one or two guys or is it the more than one person who is driving the changes there?","Martin Anstice","Well there aren\u2019t so many customers left in our world, so\u2026","James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","I guess really is the just one or is it two?","Martin Anstice","No, it\u2019s more than one. So there is I mean there is a decent amount of conversion activity happening today and my expectation Jim is that there is probably in the range of 500,000 wafer starts of DRAM conversion going to take place in the calendar year kind of all in. And that will mean that we kind of if you place out that way they will still be in the range of 400,000 wafer starts at capacity at kind of 3x or greater, in terms of kind of technology node. So a decent amount of conversion but at the end of the year even with that assumption there is still a fair amount of capacity still adds 3x or above.","James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","That ultimately could still be converted next year right?","Martin Anstice","Exactly.","James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","And on the 3D NAND, is your view there that the reason that that the changes you are seeing in that market is that because of yield on those products or is it because may be we already have what we need for NAND right now before we add any more, what\u2019s the color on what the changes are being driven by?","Martin Anstice","Yeah it\u2019s obviously a question that at the end of the day the customers you want to really answer. I am sure everything that has been written is probably relevant in some way to this. I mean there is continues to be evidence of really good discipline in terms of supply and demand balance in memory period and that\u2019s really NAND as much as it is in the DRAM. As we\u2019ve talked about a number of times the transition from planar to 3D technology in Flash memory is extremely challenging and clearly this is the year where our customers are making in varying levels of commitments investments in that evaluation and obviously there is one kind of big I that\u2019s a step ahead in terms of their commitments.","But frankly as best we can tell everybody is in investing at some level beginning to evaluate the technology. And the commentary from customers today is very similar to the commentary a year or so ago, there is up to a kind of two to three year timeline associated to transitions to 3D device depending on the customer. But I am sure the complexity of building a device, yielding a device delivering performance in a device and to the committed discipline of customers to only add capacity when it is matched by demand are all relevant in answering your question.","James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Really helpful, thanks so much, good luck.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of American. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Yes, great thanks for taking my question. I had two quick ones, one Martin I noticed that in your etch market segments when you talk about \u2013 you mostly focus on dielectric etch, kind of curious, is the incremental opportunity mostly in dielectric etch because which you\u2019re kind of maxed out, you already have a high conductor etch it or is there something else going on?","Martin Anstice","Well by virtue of market share in dielectric etch being lower than conductor etch I would all say that the opportunity again is greater. I would not agree that we are maxed out in conductor etch, I mean we have a set of business objectives to grow in all segments of our business that\u2019s clearly more difficult when you have a very strong leadership position but it\u2019s not impossible. And frankly we\u2019re making investments to grow both of etch but we have been approximately a 35% market share company for some time in dielectric and as I\u2019ve talked about a number of times, particularly evidenced by market share momentum in memory already and we\u2019re seeing some really nice signs of pick-up in support from customers in logic emerging as well. I believe we have a product to this point that is very competitive and for the first time in the long time I think we\u2019re very optimistic about the growth potential in dielectric.","Krish Sankar \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Great, that\u2019s very helpful and then a quick follow up, just in terms of the capital investment obviously you have a lot of free cash oversea and looks like you guys got investment grade status recently. So I\u2019m kind of curious what\u2019s your appetite for debt, getting on debt as of this point given that you have a delicate balance between debt and the investment grade status?","Douglas R. Bettinger","Yeah, Krish we\u2019re working our way through the current buyback authorizations. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do until that\u2019s completed at which point we\u2019ll develop a new plan and communicate to you what we\u2019re going to do. I wouldn\u2019t tell you that raising debt is completely off the table but I think we\u2019ll be able to develop a pretty good plan and have a pretty good cash return opportunity without doing that. But having said that we still have an ability to take debt on if we choose to do so, haven\u2019t made the decision yet.","Krish Sankar \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","That is terrific, thanks a lot guys.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Krish.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan Chase","Great, thank you for taking my question and solid job on the quarterly execution. As a follow up to Jim\u2019s question, the equipment spenders have been fairly limited in the first half but with your balance kind of first half second half outlook, do you also see a pipeline of more customers and program spending in the second half versus the first half? On the NAND side as you mentioned you know you\u2019ve got the transition the 15 nanometer planar by one or two of your customers, you\u2019ve got 20 nanometer DRAM transitions and an initial ramp-up of 16 nanometer FinFET by foundry customers. Does that spender base continue to broaden into the second half?","Martin Anstice","Absolutely yes, I think in every segment that\u2019s a true statement. We, as I mentioned in the question from Jim, concentration is in efforts of the high \u2013 but the first quarter of our year is the most concentrated. We\u2019re about 70% of our outlook to three guys and that three guy reference point probably drops to the 60% level, 50%, 60% level for the rest of the year. So macro level definitely more diversity at a specific level NAND transition more participant in second half to first half for sure, DRAM pretty stable while the foundry is definitely opening in the second half of the year and I think that\u2019s very consistent with kind of the comments from TSNC around their concentration spending in the first half. And the microprocessor world obviously is overwhelmed in investment terms at least by one customer and their strategy which cannot play that last year in a big way is still very relevant to them but original equipment bias in emerging theme as we step through the year for them.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan Chase","Great and then solid job on the operating margin expansion in the March quarter and holding it here in the June quarter. Obviously the team had a lot of new development initiatives ongoing. As WFE spending growth plays rather as you would expect how should we think about the OpEx profile as the year enfolds off of the June quarter base?","Martin Anstice","I think the most important guiding principle is we\u2019re not going to compromise a long-term success of a company for a kind of a short-term if any. But having said that we\u2019re not sitting here today with a belief that we have kind of fundamental disconnects between investment levels and opportunities. Always there\u2019s an appetite to do more and to spend more and I wouldn\u2019t expect us to look very different frankly from the rest of the capital equipment given in terms of increasing investments in the year. I think more or less we track together today, none of us are really kind of shocking in terms of disproportionate increases or decreases in investment.","Douglas Bettinger","Yeah and Harlan if you do the math on the guide for the June quarter you\u2019ll know that spending is picking up a bit. It\u2019s the timing of our annual merit cycle as well as new equity grants I wouldn\u2019t you shouldn\u2019t expect that to occur again for the remainder of this year, that\u2019s an annual pipeline so that\u2019s the reason for step up right now I wouldn\u2019t expect that to continue.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan Chase","Okay. [Technical Difficulty] qualitative mentioned you expect a little more bias of foundries in second half of this year, well obviously do you see spending of 30 nanometers or do you see on the next generation of 16 nanometer in the coming year?","Martin Anstice","That\u2019s really [Technical Difficulty. So I\u2019ll try and triangle it for you a little bit. I do believe for the year that the 20 nanometer and investments all represent only 80% or so ending and I do believe that for the year there were \u2013 20 nanometer investments to FinFET investments probably kind of 60:40 something in that range. So you\u2019re going to have to work with that because I don\u2019t that I expect specificity at the half level to kind of take you beyond that at this time.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan Chase","No it\u2019s fair enough. You mentioned that you got some new clean products out in the market place that you are trying to get some attraction back in that area. Should we look at 2014 as kind of the ceding year and 2015 as the year where you expect to generate some more revenues and market share gains in that business segment?","Martin Anstice","Yeah I think it\u2019s fair to say that, the whole of the plans of the company is the one in the long-term that\u2019s the more hockey sticks and that\u2019s a byproduct of being disadvantaged in a couple of ways in the last three or four years we were not competitive in terms of productivity. We believe we now are. We have a 16 chamber configuration which has mechanical throughput capabilities that I think are very competitive and the process and chamber offerings we\u2019ve designed to allow us to participate in the front end of the line clean segment in ways that we were not able to historically.","But as I will always state getting penetration in a segment of the industry which is not feature creating. It\u2019s all about yield obviously, is a very tough proposition and we respect our competition enormously. So this is a very important year for us, no question and we exit the year with one of two products, either a lot of confidence around the plans of the company and spending level consistent with that or a redefinition of the outlook for the business but we certainly as we sit here today the customer engagement is very positive and in fact we\u2019re getting kind of more pulls than we\u2019re actually satisfying today. Couple of customers are interested in the product and we\u2019re holding back a little until we validated some of the offering in the existing engagements.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan Chase","Great, thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Harlan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks a lot. A couple of things guys first of all Martin I wanted to fit what you said about a pause in mid-year, you said there\u2019s going to be pause in mid-year but then you also talked about shipments being only a little bit front half loaded this year. So I guess you probably don\u2019t want to give guidance for calendar Q3 but that would sort of imply that the September shipments are not going to come down much if they come down at all, that\u2019s the first question and then I had a follow up.","Martin Anstice","Your assumption is right, I\u2019m not going to give guidance on September and good try though. The answer obviously for September is by product not just of June but also December and so really is kind of early for me to be calling a quarter at this point. I would not expect September to be up. I think it will be about flattish or down a little. But I might be wrong and there\u2019s a lot of weeks between now and the real kind of decision point I think relates to September and December uncertainty.","At a revenue level, again it\u2019s an imperfect science for us to be articulating a view for the calendar year but I would say that our expectation is that second half quarters \u2013 if we are going to track to this $32 billion WFE number, that we believe is the case, the second half quarters will have a revenue level that\u2019s kind of plus or minus $100 million of the average of the first two quarters of this year. So that\u2019s our kind of reference point for the second half as we see it today in revenues and obviously some part of that is answering your question because revenues are byproduct of shipments.","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Perfect, awesome. As always, thanks for that. And then, just a question more for Doug. So clearly, you guys were taking a lot of WFE share this year. If I go back to the slide you put out at SEMICON West and you have your long-term financial model, you are basically at $5 billion revenue run rate right now and gross margin 46%, operating margin 22%. So you are pretty already at your 2015, 2016 model. So is this your sort of one-time mix issues that helped too in December and March or should we think that there is headroom to that model particularly given the huge second generation 3D NAND you have? Thanks.","Douglas Bettinger","Yes, Tim, I am not changing that model as we sit here today. We are not quite at that $5 billion. It\u2019s kind of high fours. And part of the margin improvement from where we are today, we are a little bit shy of that 22% and approaching the revenue level prior to its time in terms of maturing products and getting everything ramped in manufacturing. Could there be headroom? Maybe, but, it\u2019s too early to call it right now. SEMICON and our Analysts Day are too far away. We may be updating some things for you them, but there is time for that now.","Martin Anstice","So, just to kind of supplement to that, I would say a couple of things. It isn\u2019t kind of mix thing and just looks good for the quarter. I mean there are very fundamental, SAM expansion opportunities that are relevant to our company. As I said a number of times, I don\u2019t think, there is a better positions company in the equipment space by virtue of what we have in the product portfolio and what we don\u2019t in the product portfolio to exploit four or five inflections. I think we are at the right place, at time with the right products. The patterning expansion is very real and as I mentioned in the last call, we were positively surprised by the scale and scope of that in DRAM and we\u2019re only just at the beginning of it in the kind of Logic kind of rollout and all of commentary that I read at least says that, that opportunity is an increasing opportunity and substance for us through at least the 10 nanometer technology node and the longer that installed base gets positioned, the more challenging the intercept points are easy relative to kind of greenfield trade off.","So that\u2019s a very real opportunity. I think, one thing to keep in mind in terms of calling it too early or calling it too late in terms of whether we revise models is, let\u2019s not forget the intensity of the conversation from the customer on cost, right. One of the most important complexities that we have to walk through as an industry and as a company in the next number of years, all of these inflections are getting more expensive, right. Capital intensity almost in every transition is either not going down as much as it used to or quite the reverse, it\u2019s going up.","And so, we have tremendous SAM expansion opportunities. We are at least flat or positive in market share in these transitions, but the industry and part of the industry is going to see increasing pressure I am sure over the next several years as this goes from kind of pilot and technology evaluation in the case of 3D NAND into ultimately HVM manufacturing. But may be kind of finish off the thoughts, let\u2019s just kind of go back to first principles. In our last Analyst Meeting, we articulated [Technical Difficulty] to our market share we are about a 40% market share company in the segments that we compete, about a 50% share company in etch, mid 30% in deposition and high teens, low 20s in clean. And through the decisions that customers have made to-date, we believe that our market share around the inflections exceeds the 50% level. So, let\u2019s say kind of 10 point increase in market share before and after inflections.","And so, one of the most important headlines for everybody across the company is, if we continue to execute and that isn\u2019t easy, the challenge from competitors and expectations from customers are incredibly demanding, but if we execute to the plans of the company, the result is that, the outperformance you are seeing today is going to accelerate as a greater proportion of spending of customers is associate with these inflections and that\u2019s not a guidance statement, that\u2019s a statement of understanding and belief. We have got a lots of work to do to pull that off but that\u2019s what this company is focused on executing.","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Wonderful, Martin. Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Sorry for the long answer, but I felt like time for me to make that statement.","Douglas Bettinger","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Out next question is from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Weston Twigg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just real quickly wanted to ask a little bit more about shareholders expectations. It sounds like you do have some level of conviction in a rebound in the second half largely weighted towards foundry. But, I\u2019m just wondering related to FinFET from the conversations you are having with your customers, does it feel to you that they are really moving full steam ahead or that there seemed to be some risk or some hesitation perhaps to second half spend and just kind of gauging a level of conviction on that spend.","Martin Anstice","I sense conviction. It seems a very important transition for established community I think a lot of the date around custom performance for the 20 nanometer node tends to suggest that there are significant opportunities for performance improvements on both of those definitions in a FinFET device and architecture and not surprisingly it\u2019s a very competitive space for the foundry. So at least as far as the interactions that I have, there is a lot of conviction to be successful through this inflection.","Weston Twigg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Okay, good. And then just a similar question on 3D NAND, now you are indicating that there may be 80,000 wafer starts might be installed by the end of the year. And I\u2019m just wondering if you think there will be may be more downside risk or upside potential to that number at this point?","Martin Anstice","Really hard to tell. I don\u2019t know that there is a lot of either frankly and I don\u2019t think there is a tremendous amount of downside because the 80,000 wafer start level that is a pretty minimalist investment in the industry to evaluate that technology. And it\u2019s a critical period for evaluating that technology. I think every NAND customer is talking about evaluating the technology and they have their own timelines and own roadmaps in terms of HVM adoption. But I don\u2019t think any one of the NAND flash memory customers can afford to be only outside looking a technology transition. They will make their own choices about what the right point of intercept is, how many layers in a device makes sense in terms of cost comparisons, but I sense there is very minimal downside to the number that we have shared today.","Weston Twigg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. Good. Very helpful. Thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Weston.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Thank you very much. Martin, just want to follow up on your SAM expansion with multiple patterning comment. The conventional wisdom has that with multiple patterning lithography expands the most. But looking at your results and comparing, it looks like you are benefiting a lot more than some of your competitors for some of your segments. Is there something we are missing here? Is that something in the technology that is helping you more than others in terms of SAM expansion in multiple patterning?","Martin Anstice","Well, I think the \u2013 I don\u2019t know if there is anything that you are missing. You just described the substance, the opportunity, the strength of the company\u2019s position in etch and deposition both and the specific integration scheme in DRAM is very beneficial to us. And certainly with the predominance of investments in DRAM except for kind of patterning probably being upgrade related, you\u2019re going to see a bias and a waiting to the etch and deposition space by the very nature of that scheme.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Okay. And then the second follow up on your clean tool is the opportunity or the veneer or gearing, is it specific to \u2013 is it more towards foundry logic or it\u2019s memory can you give us little bit more color on where you are and what kind of results you are getting by device?","Martin Anstice","It\u2019s the engagement is memory and logic both, the win is memory. And the win is front end of line which is an important kind of test for us because that\u2019s the area of the Single Wafer Clean segment there we had been least competitive in the last three to four years. So I feel that it is an important statement from a customer but it\u2019s one. And that is not the definition of success, definition of success is establishing market share leadership in all of the products of our company and we\u2019re not there yet by a long way.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","All right that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Northland Capital Markets. Please go head.","Benedict Pang \u2013 Northland Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my question. On your 32 billion WFE if I understand you correctly the only thing that\u2019s changed on your forecast from the beginning of the year to now is that 3D NAND is lower and DRAM is higher but foundry is pretty much the same, is that right?","Martin Anstice","More or less, yeah I mean there is plus or minus $100 million here there but that\u2019s the headline.","Benedict Pang \u2013 Northland Capital Markets","Okay. And what\u2019s the lead time for your products right now for just the dep and etch?","Martin Anstice","Well the expectation from the customers typically is they place an order today and get the product tomorrow. And just occasionally we get somewhat close to that. But the typical lead times for the products in our segments are going to be inside of a quarter. And then sometimes there will be less than eight weeks and sometimes more than eight weeks.","And one of the important transitions for us in clean one of the reasons why going to next generation clean is so important to us is the lead times on the clean systems are the longest in our company today, with be old generation and new generation they will be very competitive with the deposition and etch portfolio. So we are much shorter lead time play than the bulk of them if that\u2019s your question.","Benedict Pang \u2013 Northland Capital Markets","Okay, is it fair to characterize the majority of the business in a quarter, is it trans business there?","Martin Anstice","We turn a decent amount of our business absolutely in the quarter and that\u2019s through from order placement to shipments and shipments to revenue. We can run shipment revenue turns of 60%.","Benedict Pang \u2013 Northland Capital Markets","Perfect, thank you very much, good quarter.","Martin Anstice","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Martin during the January conference call you were talking about the 20 nanometer foundry to be more of the first half and then 16, 14 since that kicking it in the second half. But today\u2019s commentary suggests that may be there is a little bit of 20 nanometer foundry push out into the second half since you described 20 nanometer as 60% of the foundry\u2019s spend.","Could you clarify or reconcile the January commentary with today\u2019s commentary and I have a follow up.","Martin Anstice","Yeah, No, I didn\u2019t say 20 nanometer was 60% of foundry spending, I said in the relationship between 20 nanometer and FinFET investment there will be a 60-40 split. So there is still an investment in foundry at the 28 nanometer node and even a little at 40. So and there are some upgrade and technical node transition as well as original equipment body. So I actually don\u2019t think there is much to reconcile here. I think evidenced by the commentary from TSMC about their first half concentration at the 20 nanometer and the plans that the industry has for second half pilot line adoption at least the math that I do today would kind of refresh and repeat what we said in January. I think we just provided more color today but basically the same headline and certainly no message to the investment community about delay.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Got it. And then going back to the share gain how should we \u2013 should we assume that the share gains coming against the larger competitors that are consolidating or is that against a smaller one, especially DRAM looking at the competitive landscape may be customers would prefer you gaining share because the larger two competitors may be becoming too big. And this I something that keeps coming up in the conference call but your results showed [Technical Difficulty] any industry, any customer and see significant scaling through consolidation of their supply chain is their staff the risk associated with that and absolutely do I see that opportunity for [inaudible] yeah I see that short term opportunity and the long-term opportunity.","And so we\u2019re going to work very hard partnering with customers to make sure that we have the opportunities as a \u2013 it doesn\u2019t kind of detract from the headline that I shared before which is we take our competition very seriously big, companies, small companies, the companies that survive today are generally very capable and very competent.","And so we\u2019re going to have to kind of keep working as hard as we are and partner with customers and I have every confidence that the partnership of Lam Research and the customer is always going to sustain the economics and story we\u2019ve characterized today.","Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Got it, thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thanks Mehdi.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group. Please go head.","C. J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group","Yeah hi thanks for taking my question. I guess first question I think you talked about second half being slightly down than first half and I was hoping to see if you can put some numbers around, is that around 55:45 or how should I think about that?","Martin Anstice","Yeah it\u2019s pretty well balanced C.J. it\u2019s high 40s, low 50s, it\u2019s plus or minus our forecasting ability on this so I would call it flattish C.J.","C. J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. And then in terms of your relative outperformance at least how I am modeling WFE versus your number what do you think you are seeing in terms of rising capital intensity, etch and deposition this year as well as share gains that you\u2019ve mentioned on the call as well as the 40 nanometer logic that\u2019s coming in? What do you think those three things add for you that other guys are not seeing?","Martin Anstice","Well honestly speaking I don\u2019t spend a huge amount of time focused on capital intensity in the way that the industry mentions it because I think it\u2019s like really misleading. I have no idea what the value of correlating leading investment levels to current year revenues is for the industry and it\u2019s just a bizarre data point from my perspective.","But there is clearly SAM expansion for etch and deposition clean and we\u2019ve kind of sized that at about the $1 billion level. And there is clearly market share expansion that we\u2019ve kind of framed multiple times including our analyst meeting and again today. So I believe that the SAM expansion opportunity is bigger than the market share but the market share is pretty big as well.","And if we can continue to execute from the positions that we\u2019ve established we\u2019ve got a 5 to 10 percentage point gain in share here through these inflections which is a really important headline for the company. And we don\u2019t kind of go out there with kind of guidance but I mean connecting the dots that we\u2019ve described today and we\u2019ve talked about kind of flattish revenues first half, second half and I try to frame for you the plus and the minus around the average in the second half.","In calendar \u201814 we are targeting to outperform the industry. And I would expect if there is a $32 billion wafer fabrication equipment year which is up may be 10 to 12 percentage points or so, depending on the kind of your baseline, I would expect that our revenues grow year-over-year by approximately 20% and if you do the math on that you are going to kind of answer a lot of your question.","And if we execute 20% year-over-year growth that means we\u2019re focused on targeting upward income growth twice as much as revenues and delivering cash from operations growth twice as much as operating income. And if we do that we\u2019re going to generate $1 billion cash from operations this year. So that\u2019s how it will kind of walks itself through the financial statements, if the $32 billion year prevails.","C. J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Shanye Hudson","And then I think we\u2019ll try to take two more quick questions if we can.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Please go head.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. So the first question is on if I look at logic out of shipment buckets I\u2019ve seen that that has been trending lower over the last few quarters. How do you kind of think about that business is it just a customer not spending there? And I understand I remember a few quarter ago you guys talked about share gain in that area right how you kind of think about long term?","Douglas Bettinger","Yeah I mean Edwin one thing you are right it\u2019s ticked down a little bit. There is a lot of [Inaudible] go on in the space especially in deposition so that\u2019s one of the things that is impacting our shipments. It\u2019s not so much that anything has been moving around from the application standpoint is being reused. And obviously you heard me talk about our expectation for June is that\u2019s ticking up a little bit and I would expect that probably does that again in December.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","I see, okay that\u2019s helpful. And then talk a little bit about the ALD when you have on a DRAM. Do you see opportunities for ALD and NAND? That\u2019s the first question. Second part, I understand the ALD part is very different from the one that we had seen in a logic side to the extent that what you have done in logic do you think you have option to grow in logic for ALD?","Douglas Bettinger","So I think yes and yes I mean we are going to see emerging opportunities for atomic level control period through traditional scaling and 3D architecture. And the most prominent win that we communicated today to your point is ALD in DRAM that we have active engagements ALD logic, a different dielectric but very active engagements and I would expect that, that continues to be true for us. So a lot of focus and big guys, small guys will try to take share from everybody.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","All right thanks Doug.","Douglas Bettinger","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Tom Diffely \u2013 D. A. Davidson","Yeah, good afternoon. I was hoping that in your slide deck you talked about some wins in events packaging. I am just curious how big advance packaging is today and how do you expect to grow to ramp over the next couple of years?","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","It\u2019s the smallest SAM for the company a $150 million something like that and it\u2019s the fastest growing and it might be the most difficult to predict, I think the 2.5 and 3D in the road map is still subject to some debates. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve clearly prioritized in the company as an important growth opportunity and its being presents with competitive action deposition clean products to pursue that is our objective. But it\u2019s the smallest of all by a long way and it\u2019s growing very quickly but from a small base. And now \u2013 go ahead sorry.","Tom Diffely \u2013 D. A. Davidson","So have you seen the leaders land space or the drivers being more in the memory or the logic side of this point?","Martin Anstice","I think it\u2019s more a logic play then anything today.","Tom Diffely \u2013 D. A. Davidson","Okay. All right, thank you.","Martin Anstice","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Gentlemen at this time I\u2019ll turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.","Shanye Hudson","Great, thank you. A webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website and on behalf of the entire management team I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us here today.

Please go ahead.","Satya Kumar","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Lam Research quarterly conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, we'll share our outlook on the business environment, review our financial results for the March 2016 quarter, our outlook for the June 2016 quarter and provide an update on our planned business combination with KLA-Tencor. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 PM Pacific Time this afternoon.

As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Martin.","Martin Anstice","Thank you, Satya, and thank you all for joining us today for our quarterly earnings conference call. This afternoon I will share highlights from the March quarter, provide some perspective on how we're performing relative to our growth objectives and share a commentary on the industry environment so far this year. Prior to turning the call over to Doug, I will conclude my prepared remarks with a status update on our planned business combination with KLA-Tencor.","Lam Research is off to a very solid beginning in 2016, with our March quarter results providing evidence of continued strong execution against our longer-term outperformance ambition. 2016 is a year where connected with the device architecture and process flow decisions of our customers, also with our decisions several years back to invest toward a long-term in enabling key technology inflections, we actively compete for more than 30% of WFE.","In the quarter just ended, we delivered revenues and shipments above the midpoints of our guidance, and gross margin, operating income and non-GAAP EPS that were all above the high-end of our guidance range. We demonstrated business model flexibility by managing core operating expenses to a level lasts reported a year ago, while growing investments in R&D over the same period.","Importantly, the results this quarter reflect a healthy balance of leadership focus on both our short-term and long-term. Most important of course is our long-term commitments to the success of our customers. Overall, our performance is a testament to the high-quality focus, the teamwork and execution of Lam employees throughout the company, and for that I would like to thank them all sincerely.","As we evaluate the performance of Lam currently and develop strategies to support our vision for the combined company, we are driven by the opportunity for compelling value creation. Standalone and combined with KLA-Tencor, we model robust and predictable cash generation, supplemented by growth outperformance and over time more opportunities for investing in profitable growth and returning excess cash to shareholders.","The growth thesis for Lam over the next several years is rooted in our strategy to partner closely with our customers to enable key technology inflections, such as 3D device architecture and multi-patterning process flows, and is validated by our performance in the last several years. As our results reveal, this strategy is working and is enabling the increased strategic relevance of Lam Research in our industry.","Calendar 2016 is a year, where industry spending trends are increasingly biased to disciplined and strategic investments across most device segments, which lends further supports to our conviction in a multiyear company outperformance opportunity. This spending bias, we contend also is a driver for continued healthy WFE spending levels for the foreseeable future, despite somewhat tepid macro conditions.","Now, looking at our progress across the inflection, first with 3D NAND. We see increasing adoption rates of this technology, strong traction for our products and service offerings and growing clarity around next-generation device industry roadmaps. First generation 3D NAND production involves etching through 30 or more stacked pairs of films. But these are growing to 60 or more pairs for next-generation devices, resulting in increased challenges for critical high-aspect ratio dielectric etch and also staircase conductor etch.","Our Flex F and G Series dielectric products, featuring proprietary iron energy control and high selectivity, have tripled their install base in the last year and established Lam as the market leader in dielectric etch segments.","Our Kiyo conductor etch platform with industry leading etch selectivity has enabled more than a two times improvements in the number of layers that can be etched in-situ for staircase applications, with the results that a majority of 3D NAND customers have now included Lam in their staircase etch HVM purchases.","Our VECTOR ALD platform offers differentiated processing capability, allowing expansion of our SAM from multi-patterning to now include 3D NAND gap filled applications also.","Turning to FinFETs and multi-patterning. During the quarter, we continued to build on the momentum of our differentiated Kiyo with hydra-conductor etch and Flex dielectric etch platforms for critical front-end-of-line FinFET transistor solutions for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technology nodes. As we communicated at the recent SPIE lithography conference, atomic level processing to control variability is increasingly critical for multiple patterning and that need will persist in an EUV-enabled environment.","Our customers at the conference continued to affirm their strategy of leveraging improvements in both EUV and multi-patterning to address their needs and together with our peer group. We have conviction, the deposition and etch multi-patterning applications will grow for many years to come. Fundamental to enabling our share gains have been the performance of our 35,000-plus process module install base and in calendar '15, a 10 points improvements in our customer satisfaction indexes.","On this last point, it was extremely satisfying that our logic segment capabilities and partnership have progressed to a point where we were one of very few companies recognized recently as preferred quality supplier to Intel. The focus we explained at SEMICON West 2015 of developing new value-add product and services is intended to provide our customers productivity, utilization and reuse benefits, in addition to creating new SAM growth opportunities across leading-edge and mature technology nodes for our company.","As planned, over a multiyear period, we are on schedule for our install base business revenues to outgrow materially our install base units' expansion. In calendar '16, our emphasis includes implementing systemic improvements in customer satisfaction, increasing our spares market share with new products differentiated by Lam-specific OEM knowledge in learning, and building upon the early adoption successes of new install based advanced services and productivity solutions achieved last year.","Now, I would like to provide a brief updates on demand and WFE trends. Expectations of the experts for global economic growth have been revised slightly lower, since our last report. End-market demand trends for technology products remain mixed with additional weakness in the PC market and relatively stable, although lower than expected growth rates in mobile.","Meanwhile, we continue to expect solid demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market, driven by the long-term move to the cloud, storage and competition applications both. More importantly perhaps, we believe that Lam and the equipment industry broadly have an opportunity and responsibility to innovate for and with our customers to create a catalyst for the high levels of IC unit demand. Certainly, that is our conviction and thinking, both as a standalone process company and combined with KLA-Tencor.","Our outlook for the memory market continues to reflect the offsetting factors of strong 3D NAND spending and meaningful declines in DRAM spending, driven largely by PC weakness year-over-year. The latter has resulted in now well-publicized and rational response from our DRAM customers, which should continue to help improve the ICE unit supply demand balanced. We expect the DRAM capacity to remain essentially flat-to-slightly down this year.","DRAM WFE we estimate to represents mid-to-high $5 billion spending this year, focused almost exclusively on 20-nanometer and 1x nanometer upgrade investments to improve cost competiveness and device performance. We expect non-volatile memory industry WFE to exceed $9 billion in 2016 with every industry participants committed to the 3D roadmap.","Spending patterns and the strategic actions by our customers in 2016 offer the clearest evidence yet. The 3D NAND and new non-volatile memories are evolving to have a transformational influence on the computes and storage industry, as device and system architectures evolve for consumer and enterprise cloud applications.","3D NAND in particular has an integration scheme that is heavily biased towards deposition and etch, a statement that is increasingly true as the customers transition from building Greenfield 3D fabs to conversions from 2D to 3D, and eventually from first generation 3D through subsequent vertical scaling.","We assess that the equipment industry remains on track to ship a cumulative 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month of 3D NAND capacity by the end of 2016, which includes around two-thirds by yearend production qualified. The headline for LAM is that with just under a quarter of global capacity 3D NAND capable by the end of this year, we are in very early stages of a multiyear growth opportunity. There is much for us to be excited about.","We continue to expect flat-to-slightly better WFE in foundry and logic, where the majority of the spending is focused on strategic investments to enable 10-nanometer technology, although as stated previously, IoT applications, automotive, wearables and low-end phones, et cetera, are driving a healthy resurgence of 28-nanometer capital expenditure.","Doug will provide more details in our financial guidance, but our shipments outlook in a flattish WFE environment is consistent with our ongoing outperformance commentary and prior long-term models. We ended this quarter with our strongest backlog and deferred revenue balance combined in the recent history of Lam, and we expect stronger shipments in June with sequential growth of approximately 9%.","We retain our 2016 WFE outlook of 33 billion plus or minus 2 billion. And from a momentum perspective guide the first half '16 shipments stronger than our second half '15. And although slightly muted perhaps from our more conservative DRAM outlook today and some first half, second half rebalancing, we're still encouraged by the potential for slightly stronger shipment second half '16 over our first half '16.","Now, I will conclude with some comments on the planned combination of Lam Research with KLA-Tencor. As a reminder, with continued execution and our priority on being number one in customer trust, we have the confidence that standalone Lam Research has a continuing growth outperformance opportunity over the next several years.","We have elected to use this recent period of strength and an exciting outlook to pursue an even more strategic agenda to innovate beyond, what is possible, in two great companies separately for the benefit of all stakeholders. We invested a number of years developing the strategy with our customers and believe with all subsequent interactions, they are materially invested in the success of our vision. They trust our genuine commitments to the broad ecosystem and they are increasingly motivated by the opportunity for new joint development projects together.","As we move through the early stages of integration planning, and our conviction in the business combination and the opportunities that will drive for the customer and combined company is only getting stronger. The integration planning team has been focused on understanding the organizational design and business processes of the two companies in order to ensure a seamless transition for our customers, suppliers and employees.","We have announced internally and introduced to our customers a very strong global leadership team with balanced representation from both companies. Although, we remain two separate companies until the dates of deal closing, and until that time our most fundamental responsibility is to deliver on preexisting commitments made to our customers. Comprehensive integration activities have reinforced our confidence in achieving both, the stated cost and revenue synergies.","In recent weeks, we received approval from both KT and Lam stockholders and have received regulatory approvals in Israel, Taiwan and Ireland. We are actively engaged with all other required agencies and remain confident that we will close the transaction some time around midyear. Our best estimate is June, July, plus or minus a couple of months.","With that, let me turn the call over to Doug, who will provide an updates on the March quarter and our guidance for June.","Douglas Bettinger","Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings day. We're pleased with the momentum to be starting the year with. Our results for the March quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics.","Shipments for the quarter were $1.446 billion, which was up 12% sequentially and above the midpoint of the guided range. Memory shipments were strong in the quarter with the combined memory segment making up 70% of total system-level shipments, and that compares with 65% in the prior quarter.","Memory shipments were weighted heavily toward the non-volatile segment, which represented 43% of system shipments in the March quarter. This is up from 23% in the prior quarter, driven by ongoing customer investments in 3D NAND wafer capacity as well as increasing layer counts. We continue to see 3D NAND spending focused on both new wafers as well as technology conversions.","DRAM made up 27% of the shipments, which was down from 42% in the December quarter. We're seeing continued discipline spending in the DRAM segment with a focus on 20-nanometer technology conversions to both reduce cost per bit and to enable improved performance.","The foundry segment was up slightly in dollar terms in the March quarter accounting for 23% of system shipments. Foundry spending is focused on both leading-edge 10-nanometer investments as well as continued spending at 28-nanometer and above. The logic and other segment contributed 7% of system shipments.","Shipments into the China region were particularly strong in March, representing 27% of total shipments. The majority of the spending in China continues to be spent by global multinational customers putting capacity in place within the country.","Revenue came in at $1.314 billion in the March quarter, which was down roughly 8% from the December quarter. This revenue result was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin for the period came in at 45.1%, somewhat stronger than we expected. Better field and factory utilization and favorable product mix benefited gross margin in the quarter.","And as I've shared with you before, our gross margins are a function of a number of factors, such as overall business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, and you should expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter. I'd like to remind you that our financial model is still the best way to think about our ongoing performance.","Operating expense in the quarter were roughly flat at $350 million and this compares to $352 million in the December quarter. The majority of our spending continues to be allocated to funding our critical R&D programs. These investments are important in preparing for the current and next-generation technology inflections, enabling us to take full advantage of the opportunities ahead of us.","Operating income in the March quarter came in at $242 million and that compares to $296 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 18.4% above the high-end of the guided range, due to both the higher revenue as well as a stronger gross margin.","The tax rate for the quarter was 14% and that compares with 7% last quarter. That by the way was about what we expected. A tax rate in the low-to-mid teens for the remainder of 2016 would be reasonable for you to use in your earnings models.","Based on a share count of approximately 172 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter were $1.18, above the guidance range. The share count includes dilution on a non-GAAP basis from both the 2016 and 2041 convertible notes with the total dilutive impact of about 11 million shares. Dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.","We returned $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders. This equated to $0.30 on a per share basis. We did not repurchase any shares in the open market in the March quarter, consistent with our stated plans ahead of closing the proposed KLA-Tencor transaction.","So now, let me turn to the balance sheet. We continue to have a healthy cash position. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased to $4.8 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash from operations was $183 million and that compares to $295 million in December.","The March shipment profile was biased toward the backend of the quarter, resulting in an increase in both accounts receivable and days sales outstanding quarter-over-quarter. DSO increased to 86 days in March. I expect this will reduce in the June quarter, as linearity is less back-end weighted. The quality of our receivable balance continues to be very strong. We've got a bluechip set of customers.","Inventory turns declined to 3.2x due to the inventory build for the growth in the June quarter. Days payable outstanding extended to 46 days as a result of the timing of purchases within the quarter. Cash generation was partially offset by dividends paid as well as capital expenditures.","We exited the quarter with deferred revenues of $511 million, which is up from $395 million in December. This amount excludes $121 million in shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments remain on our balance sheet as inventory carried at cost.","Company non-cash expenses for the quarter included $35 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization and $35 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $46 million, which was up from $28 million in the December quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 7,300 regular full-time employees, which was flat with December.","Looking ahead now, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect shipments of $1.575 billion, plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1.525 billion, again plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point.","I do expect that the September quarter gross margin will be a little bit softer than in June due to customer concentration and product mix, and we forecast operating margins of 22%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.63, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 173 million shares. We're pleased with our performance this quarter and with the guidance we've just shared for the June quarter.","We're delivering financial results coming from the strategic focus of the company on creating differentiated product and service offerings that enable the success of our customers. As we sit here today, I continue to expect that second half of the year will have a stronger topline in the first half due to investments in leading-edge foundry and logic.","And just one last item I'd like to share with you. We will not be doing our normal Investor Day at SEMICON West this year. Our plans will be to do something later in the year, likely in the month of November. We will announce exact dates and venue later in the year as we finalize our plans.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Couple of questions. Could you just, maybe I missed this, but the gross margin dynamics, could you talk about what's driving the 90 basis points uptick sequentially in the June quarter? And how much of that is really leveraged versus mixed driven? And then what exactly is having with the mix in September, I guess, that takes it down again? And could you quantify that number for us?","Douglas Bettinger","Yes. There's a lot of different things that move gross margin around, which are overall business levels, you get product mix, you get a little bit of customer concentration some times that move it around. You've got a combination of all of those things occurring in the June quarter. And then it softens up a little bit in September, which is why I gave you a little bit of that color, which I normally wouldn't do. I think it will be a little bit later in the September.","Amit Daryanani","And is there a way to think about just the quantification of how much -- is it the 90 basis points that reverses back in September or a much smaller number potentially?","Douglas Bettinger","I'm not going to quantify it numerically except just to tell you, it's going to be a little bit softer.","Amit Daryanani","And if I can just follow-up on the KLA transaction. Could you just talk about what are the regulatory requirements or any other milestones that's left to be achieved? I know, you mentioned, some that you've already done, but I'm curious what's left over here for the deal to close.","Douglas Bettinger","Yes, we don't have specific disclosure on the agencies that we're working with. We have more to do. And we're kind of public with disclosure as and when certain kind of milestones are achieved, so you kind of have what you have. I think the important message is we're still confident of achieving approval for this transaction midyear. And I provide a little bit more kind of color in prepared comments.","Again, basic headlines, there are no product overlaps between these two companies. And at least as best I can tell from every customer reaction I had before we announced this deal and every customer transaction that I've had the benefit of having subsequently, there is a genuine investments in the success of the combined company and the innovation that will be possible as a result of this investment.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Tim Arcuri","So Martin, I just wanted to ask about China. And I know that most of the activity is from the multinationals right now, but can you sort of talk a bit about, there's a lot of these big huge chunky numbers out there, these big memory projects, most of them beginning at the end of this year and sort of into next year.","And you can debate how much IP they have, but certainly, they seem pretty focused on spending their money. So I'm wondering whether you've thought about sort of what the incremental is to WFE or more specifically your business from the captive Chinese projects. Could it add a $2 billion to WFE as early as next year?","Martin Anstice","Well, I certainly think there is a very compelling and thoughtful strategic rationale for the investments. I mean, the kind of balance of payments motivation from my point of view at least is very intuitive. As Doug outlined in his prepared comments today, the majority of today's investment is the international companies. And so clearly, there is upside to the extent that's there are indigenous company investments made, which to your point require access to technology one way or other, either it's acquired partners or developed internally.","My instinct is that in the long-term, the investment that's available to our industry, the investments in WFE, naturally balances around supply and demand. And so is there a spike at the beginning of a geographic commitment to an investment like China, probably yes, and exactly how much, to be determined in my opinion. But I think at least perhaps if not more important question is, what are the opportunities for incremental IC unit demand to be created from this investments and what's capital equipment additions would prevail in that context.","And I think we all recognize that incremental IC unit growth only occurs when there are performance or costs benefits above and beyond the baseline. And certainly the partnerships that emerged in China between design houses, semiconductor companies, electronics companies and ultimately semiconductor manufacturers create opportunities for partnerships to be attacked with demand.","And whether performance benefits prevail is to be determined, and cost benefits obviously capture the government incentives and agenda that are relevant particularly in China in next several years. So I do expect a bump to be determined how big, I do think it's an authentic agenda. I do think it will be executed with discipline and I think in the long-term it's all about the costs and the performance of a chip.","Tim Arcuri","And then I guess just as a quick follow-up. I think the numbers suggest that the industry is adding this year sort of from a trajectory point of view in 3D roughly 200,000 versus where you closed last year and versus that 350,000 to 400,000 that you'll close this year. So at that sort of 200,000 run rate, like is that a reasonable number to assume that the end of Q will add per year going forward or rather will convert or is this year a year that was like abnormally above that? I'm just sort of trying to figure out how many more years to a point really concerned about how many more years there is left on the conversion of the existing plane and I'm just trying to help that.","Martin Anstice","Yes. So I think as best I can tell, it's kind of to four years plus minus a bit, that's kind of the customer dialog. Another piece of data is the data that I think included in my prepared comments that the 350,000 to 400,000 is a ships capacity reference, probably a third of that is being qualified at the end of the year. So it will take some time to get production ready. There are, I think, 1.3 million wafer starts per month of capacity in the non-volatile memory space. So the headline is less than 25% of it is capable of making a 3D device by the end this year.","I think your question, obviously, is specifically unanswerable, because at the end of the day the pace at which the customer transitions is a byproduct of success in the marketplace on performance and cost. But the momentum is clearly there. It is the device. And our customers have made that commitment. So I think 95% of spending this year is 3D device architecture. And they will, as best I can tell, execute that over a four-year period, plus or minus a bit. And so three to five years is probably a reasonable proxy, but it speeds up or slows down on the basis of cost and performance.","Martin Anstice","And Tim, as you know, even once it converted, 3D will evolve in terms of layer count and the architecture. So even after playing it, a 3D is done making that conversion 3D-to-3D has a long way in front it.","Douglas Bettinger","Yes, I mean it's for sure. It's a 10-year roadmap to be very clear with you. And deposition and etch segments are well-recognized, I think, by every industry participants at this point, that we're kind of very central to vertical scaling. And the other reference I think that's relevant to answer your question is what's the roadmap for SSD.","So this is probably the single biggest example in the semiconductor industry for IC unit demand creation. And there is a $30 billion hard disk drive marketplace that every solid-state drive company is pursing in our ability to contribute productivity and performance to that agenda is a real enabler of incremental IC unit demand, which is a supplement to what we're describing here. So from my point of view, it's a really exciting headline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Martin, you seemed confident on second half sales growth versus first half. You seem to have maybe a slightly more tempered view on second half shipment growth versus first half, maybe not as much as you had previously anticipated. I think you mentioned maybe a slightly lower DRAM spending profile. Any other moving pieces, logic or foundry, which slightly tempers your kind of second half shipment outlook?","Martin Anstice","No, simple answer. I mean, it really is kind of a PC and DRAM kind of story. There is a little bit of rebalancing going on between the June quarter and September quarter, but that will always be true and we'll probably see even more by the time we get there, in what direction I can't tell you today.","But the headline for us in terms of the momentum, I think is really positive. We believe that as we're guiding today, our first half '16 shipments exceed our second half '15 shipments. We believe that we got potential for second half '16 shipments to exceed first half '16 shipments. And we're very confident that second half '16 revenues exceed first half '16 revenues.","At a segment level, our first half '16 memory shipments exceed our second half '15 memory shipments. So that's probably a company specific commentary that you're going to have to kind of absorb and digest from a modeling point of view. But the real swing factor in terms of WFE was PC units and the consequence in DRAM, and certainly the good news is I made both of those statements, because if we had a PC adjustment and no adjustment in DRAM spending, we'd be setting ourselves up collectively for a bigger problem statement. So for me that's a great commentary on the industries ability to react through changes in their market.","Harlan Sur","And then solid job on the discipline OpEx implied within your guidance I think for the June quarter is a step up to about $365 million, it's still lower than the overall topline growth and responsible for the operating margin expansion. So as the team steps up revenues into second half of the calendar year, how should we think about your level of OpEx growth relative to topline growth?","Douglas Bettinger","Harlan, the way we should think about it is, I'll just refer you back to the financial model that we shared with you at SEMICON West mid-last year, I mean that's how we think about managing the company. It won't be exactly that every single quarter, but we do have that in our minds when we let R&D spending. And by the way in the June quarter, the biggest uptick in spending will be R&D. But we're cognizant of the profitability of the company as we manage things.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad","Martin, my question is on your etch market share on staircase. One of your competitors was obviously talking about market share staircase early in the 3D NAND cycle. I just want to understand like what drove the market share shift towards Lam? And how big is the market? And where are we in terms of, like what's the market share like on the already installed base? And how do you see that going forward on the staircase etch?","Martin Anstice","Yes. I mean, I think the most important headline today is the very same headline. We communicated I think in SEMICON West of 2014. And the headline was the most important selection decision is the production tool of record position and that's true for us as it is anybody else in the industry.","And we all work really hard to get a development tool of record position, but the only way you actually extend that into a production tool of record position, which is where the money gets spent is by demonstrating an ability to meet the specifications that you've sold or positions and making a productive and repeatable and having kind of consistency of high volume manufacturing production for our customers.","So that's a continuum, and all of sudden it's not just oh, we're done, we never have to worry about it any more, we have to work really hard every single day to make sure that the advantage that's we've been able to present that is legitimized our participation in staircase selections is something that's sustained itself over multiple years and that's clearly the objective for the company.","So it's really about just the natural passing of time and transitioning from [indiscernible] staircase is an important application, it's not the most critical. I think you recollect that we have about 90% market share in the critical etch, after the critical etch and deposition applications in the 3D NAND transition, and that's the kind of foundation of competitive strength of the company and the staircase is something we work hard to position in the HVM selections and we're very pleased with the results, although we've got more work to do and more upside of course.","Farhan Ahmad","And my second question is regarding the ALD and ALE opportunity. At SPIE obviously Lam talked about great importance of ALD and ALE and some of your customers as well in addressing some of the etch placement and\/or issues. I want to understand like should we think of these markets as being incremental to your core market or its just that you have more of the traditional etch being replaced by atomic layer etch? And how does the shift from like more of the traditional etches to atomic layer etch, how does that affect your market opportunities? Is it much slower? Is it like on a per layer basis much more intensive? If you could talk about that that will be really helpful?","Martin Anstice","Yes. I would say, and this is going to be a Lam specific commentary, I will say for etch, I would not be thinking of it as particularly incremental. I think it's a commentary on more capability, more defendability, higher barriers of entry around the critical applications focus that we have in our company and the position of strength we have in etch.","So for me as the technology roadmap of the customer gets more challenging, the bigger the proportion of etch-related differentiation will be occupied by atomic level control. The deposition also might be slightly different. And again, this is clearly a commentary for Lam Research, because we don't the comprehensive deposition product portfolio.","We have, at least, one sizeable gap in the product portfolio compared to others. And so the atomic level deposition product roadmap for us has an opportunity to be disruptive more holistically and creates a growth potential for Lam Research above and beyond what might be available for a generic deposition kind of baseline.","Operator","We'll go next to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore","I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your memory customers and the relationship between their spending levels and their cash flow both NAND and DRAM are quite worse than I probably thought they'd be here to date. I think there is pretty good cash flow coverage on the spending now, but it's eroding as the year goes by. What are your conversations with your customers telling you about that and how much of you're thinking on the second half is predicated on memory economics getting better?","Martin Anstice","Well, it may only not surprise you, but I don't actually have that precise conversation with the customer, because that's their gig and their business. What I do focus on is sustainability of investments. What I do focus on is the strategic nature of investments. And what I do focus on is the response to changes in IC unit demand.","And so when I look at memory, I see the type of correction happening in DRAM that I consider to be healthy, responsible and disciplined. And that's a good thing for the future of the industry and it kind of sets us up I think in DRAM for a more positive year in '17 and '16, but a lot can happen between now and then.","And in NAND, this is about as strategic as it gets. So you have the first in history where every single participant of the non-volatile memory space is committed to 3D architecture. And clearly, they have to have an ability to pay for that roadmap. But I think it's so strategic, few would be comprised by short-term profitability or short-term kind of cash issues. Does that helps?","Joseph Moore","Yes, that helps. And then, I guess, also in DRAM where all three of your DRAM customers are working on important yield transitions, I mean are you seeing flexibility there. And I think that you talked about maybe a little bit of a lower expectation for DRAM, any concerns if that continues to deteriorate if DRAM continues to deteriorate?","Martin Anstice","I mean, clearly the market is telling it something with ASPs with announcements in the kind of the PC space and DRAM generally. I mean people are kind of adjusting their plans and there is still is significant legitimately to 20-nanometer transitions and 1x roadmaps and there is a generation or two beyond that in people's strategic plans. And there are real performances in cost benefits that go with our roadmap. But we're assuming we ended the year with slightly less capacity in terms of wafer starts than we began the year, which kind of sets us up nicely for next year.","Operator","Next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel.","Patrick Ho","Martin, firstly in terms of the logic and foundry space based, you mention that you saw both investments in 10 and 28-nanometer. How does, I guess the life extension of these logic nodes, particularly for 28 and probably for both 14 and 10, how does that extension of life of these nodes, I guess, benefit you specifically in terms of both systems as well as the aftermarket sales?","Martin Anstice","I'm not really sure, I'm going to get your question here, but I'll give a shot. Obviously, we have a very long tail to our installed base business, when we sell something. So it's a 20 year commitment to our customers, once we sold a system in many respects and a 20 year opportunity in terms of upgradability and productivity improvements and so on and so forth. So clearly, this is the year where the majority of investments in logic and foundry are focused on leading-edge technology, but the cycle of investments in IoT and other broad marketplaces of 28 is creating installed base business opportunities above and beyond our baseline.","You may recollect from our SEMICON West presentation a year or so ago, we talked about an objective to grow our installed business at a rate that was faster than our installed base segment growth. As we introduced new products and services to accommodate some respond to the productivity needs of our customers in the mature technology nodes and that's exactly what we're executing. So hopefully I got the essence of your question there.","Patrick Ho","Now, I'll use my follow-up maybe to just kind of expand on that. I guess, what I was trying to get is in the past using leading-edge nodes when they ramp up, the previous nodes kind of starts falling off and pretty rapidly. But you're seeing these older nodes last a lot longer. I guess, what are the incremental opportunities both on the systems side, as well as on the aftermarket there is for Lam given these changing, I guess, industry dynamics?","Martin Anstice","So there clearly is an opportunity, and so incremental 28-nanometer shows up because it's a great node in many respects. So it has a good performance threshold and cost dynamic that is relevant for a lot of kind of IoT-related demand. And so it's kind of a sweet spot in many respects. We have kind of great position. We are developing, in some cases, new product to be more competitive in the more mature technology nodes.","And there are even examples where we're introducing new 200 millimeter product, believe it or not for some of these applications. They are not necessarily material in the context of the revenues of the company, but hopefully illustrative of the commitment that we make to all customers, not just those customers with leading edge.","And clearly, when it comes to productivity solutions, clearly when it comes to install base improvement, advance services, utilization, productivity and reuse are everything to do with the economics of the semiconductor industry these days and that's not really new. But to your points, we're finding ways to contribute more to the customer's success and create some expansion opportunities and increase market share for Lam at the same time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Chin with UBS.","Steven Chin","Just a follow-up question on the strong shipments that you saw to China in this March quarter. Can you share some color on the customer diversity there? Was it concentrated into just one of these multinational customers or more than one? Just wondering if we should think about China being lumpy shipment region or are there enough multinational customers to make stuff consistently high region every quarter?","Martin Anstice","You're seeing just pretty much everybody that's spending at the leading edge and some not at the leading edge, actually it's not really leading edge, making investments in China. And 80%-ish of the spending that we're seeing are global multinationals putting some level of capability in China, Steven. And it's not one; it's pretty much across the board. And I think it has been pretty well chronicled in the trade press who is making those investments.","Steven Chin","And then just a follow-up question on trying to size up the wafer fab equipment opportunity in China. Do you think we could think about looking at China's installed base of 200 millimeter wafer capacity and possibly thinking about how much of a cost upgrade all of that to, let's say, state-of-the-art 300 millimeter capacity. Is that a reasonable way to try to size up the long-term China WFE market?","Martin Anstice","You probably have to ask them. I mean, I am sure that the full spectrum of options will be exploited at some level, right. I mean, there are assets in place at 200 and below and assets of 300 and the customer will optimize that footprint as well as they can.","But if they have presumably productive fabs at 200 millimeter that are technology nodes that meets and are correlated with the domestic demand, then they are as likely, if not more likely to stay in that form than be changed. So I mean our instinct is that if you go back to first principals here, performance and cost matter when it comes to the agenda and the sustainability of an agenda, it would seem more rational, the more of the spending at 300 millimeter related certainly in terms of greenfield.","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Shankar with Bank of America.","Chris Shankar","I had couple of them. Thanks for the color on the second half shipment and revenue. I just wanted to ask the question a different way. If the industry is flattish this year for WFE given the last couple of years, you guys have outperformed the industry, is it fair to assume your revenue growth will be better than the industry trend for this year calendar '16?","Douglas Bettinger","That's the plan.","Martin Anstice","Yes, Chris, I mean we've talked about these technology inflections, they will be a bigger percent of the total spend this year than they were last year and as you know that benefits us.","Douglas Bettinger","So I mean another reference, and it's not a linear progression, so it's little hard for us to kind of give you much more than these two reference points, but the outperformance commentary of the company is highly correlated to the technology inflection 3D device architecture, multi-patterning we've talked about it many times.","And our estimates of the proportion of WFE last year that was inflections-based it was 33%. Our estimate of the proportion of WFE that will be inflections-based in calendar '18 is approximately 55%. So we are on a journey. We've come from zero to 33% last year and we're on our way to the mid-50s few years from now.","Chris Shankar","And then industry level question, when you see the second half versus first half comparison on the spending run rate, it looks like there was more 3D NAND spending in the first half of this year. Should we assume the second half is going to be weighted more towards 10-nanometer logic foundry customers? And if so does it have any impact in your gross margin profile?","Martin Anstice","Yes, I mean, we had previously stated that all segments except NAND were second half biased. It is the by product of this PC and DRAM story. We would now say, memory first half '16 is stronger than second half of '16. And logic foundry, to your points, second half '16 is stronger than first half of '16. So if you want to kind of have first half, second half profile, our assumption is memory is in the mid-50s in the first half and foundry logic is 55 to 60 level in the second half of '16.","Operator","Next, we'll go to C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","I guess first question, Martin. You've outlined basically a flat WFE outlook. Curious what it would take to see growth this year? Where would you handicap, I guess, the highest probability where you could see an upward surprise?","Martin Anstice","I don't think I'd call that DRAM. So I guess, I mean, as I call that 3D NAND or logic, I think there is, as we've discussed many times, there's a real value proposition here to high performing and lower cost non-volatile memory relative to solid-state drive and hard disk drive kind of trade off. So there is a compelling motivation to be as good as we can, and as an ecosystem as fast as we can.","This is a pretty complex transition. And it's the first year where everybody has kind of invested in it, so it's not the easiest thing to do. But I would say, at least from the interactions I've had with customers, the direction in terms of yielding is very positive. So probably the biggest upside is 3D NAND in terms of really getting traction and how that plays out we'll see. Technically, there's probably upside in foundry relative to kind of 7-nanometer, but that's some ways off probably, if I interpret the comments from our customers in the last several days correctly.","C.J. Muse","And I guess as my follow-up, there seems to be a pretty good debate around the sustainability of 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer foundry logics spending. I'm just curious if we added roughly 10,000 equipment shipped in '15, roughly 35,000 this year, how do you think the world evolves next year? I know, it's a long time from now, but would love to hear your thoughts.","Martin Anstice","Unfortunately, I'm not going to be quantitative about these thoughts. But qualitatively, as best I can tell, C.J., there is much more substance to a 10 and 7 conversation in terms of performance and cost benefits for the fab-less community than what's true at '16. And the tape-out data that's presented looks like it is supporting that rationale.","The fab-less community in the foundries have growth trajectories that exceed overall semiconductors, so I mean at the end of the day, it's going to boil down to the reality of power, processing speed and cost. And if the substance of those roadmaps is there from my point of view, they will be demanded. And I've seen a growth in those segments will create expansion in our industry, so that's the best I can do.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Edwin Mok with Needham and Company.","Edwin Mok","First, I want to call quickly on install base business. I think previously you guys talked about how [indiscernible] will 13% comp growth for that business over the next few years. So wondering are you tracking in line with that? And as some of these new product you guys have shoveled the last two years come off, do you expect that to drive some incremental growth in that business?","Martin Anstice","Yes. I mean, the prepared comments actually were intended to communicate that. I mean we put a lot of time and effort in the last several years into engineering the set of products and services consistent with the objectives that you correctly stated. And we validated a number of those with the key customer selections last year and now it's about kind of broadening the penetration of those products.","I would expect that the install base business as a proportion of our business goes up not down consistent with the some expansion that we're describing to you and executing on a day-by-day basis. So we come into the year pretty strong, I would say on installed based products and services.","Edwin Mok","And then just kind of quick follow-on the DRAM investment there. I think one of your peers has talked about potential increase DRAM investment, they expect to come into the second half of this year, maybe predicate on 18-nanometer investment. Do you have any color on in terms of timing of that and what do you think customers are in terms of actually getting ready to ramp 18-nanometer?","Martin Anstice","Well, they're clearly is -- there is kind of roadmap for below 20 and there is clearly described value from a performance and the cost point of view and there clearly is some investments showing up this year. At least through the lead times that are relevant in our business, and actual in deposition, we don't expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. But depending on your lead times, it could well be and if you have long lead times and that's your conclusion that probably bodes well for us in the first quarter of next year.","Operator","Take our next question from Wes Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Wes Twigg","First just want to come back to this ALD growth idea and wondering if you can give us an idea of your growth expectations or revenue expectations in 2016?","Martin Anstice","Unfortunately, not. And I'd love to help you, Wes, but it's one of the more strategic kind of product lines in the company. There are hugely complex dynamics associated with positioning in ALD technology against others. So we are behaving with stealth for reasons that are really important to us in terms of competitive advantage.","Wes Twigg","That make sense. I guess, I'll ask another question, you probably can answer then. You spoke about non-volatile memory WFE this time. I think, what you're trying to perhaps do is be inclusive of 3D cross-pointing them. Just wondering if you're seeing any 3D cross-point activity yet or if you think that will be meaningful this year or do you think that's more of a 2017 event for you?","Martin Anstice","I think, we've also got to be a little bit careful with disclosure, but I've heard at least one other equipment company say what I'm about to say, which is, the vast majority of spending is related to traditional kind of 3D NAND architecture. And I'll leave it at that, if I may.","Douglas Bettinger","There is a reason, Wes, we're saying non-volatile memory, because other things are beginning to happen.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Mehdi Hosseini.","Mehdi Hosseini","I have two follow-up. Martin, your September quarter is historically kind of seasonally down, and with the second half up compared to the first half, is there any quarterly trend we need to be aware? If I just take the midpoint of your shipment guide for the June and go flat from there, I get to mid single-digit growth. But I also want to be aware if there is any seasonality with September quarter?","Martin Anstice","I frankly, I literally never think about seasonality, because I don't know what it would mean for our business anymore for all the same reasons that I don't know what cyclicality means anymore. I mean the second to the industry are trending and tracking, definitely this is a very strategic year.","And best counsel I can give you, relative to modeling Lam, is what we've said, the long-term financial model is the best calibration for kind of profitability and performance, given WFE. And you've heard us describe an expectation that our second half revenues are higher than first half revenues this year. And we've got a decent shot having some upside in shipments as well, second half over first half. So that's the best we can offer you at this point.","Mehdi Hosseini","And then the second follow-up or clarification, you talked about 350,000 to 400,000 wafer per month of 3D NAND at capacity added. How do you think about the yield impact, if three of the four manufactures are going through the learning curve, would that have any material impact on wafer capacity in '17 as yields improve?","Martin Anstice","My presumption is not, but that's an industry answer, not a company answer, because we like obviously as many customers as we can have and we don't have so many. But honestly speaking, I think as an equipment industry we're agnostic to kind of who is spending the money. My presumption is, if there is demand for ICs, someone will fill it, and they'll need to buy equipment to make it.","So there are five companies participating in a non-volatile memory RAM, as the best I know on a significant scale, and they are competing with intensity to get their fair share and we're supporting all of them in the exercise of their objectives. But if one yields faster or slower, presumably it makes itself out for the industry.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our Q&A portion of the call. I return the floor to our speakers for closing comments.","End of Q&A","Satya Kumar","Thank you, operator. That's all the time we have for today. Thank you for your participation. And we look forward to updating you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.",""],"12953":["Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 24, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Tina Correia - Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Tim Archer - President and Chief Executive Officer","Doug Bettinger - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","C.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tina Correia, CVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Tina Correia","Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the March 2019 quarter, and our outlook for the June 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.","Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 P.M. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","With that let me hand the call over to Tim.","Tim Archer","Thanks, Tina and hello everyone. After Doug and I go through our prepared comments, we look forward to your questions. Lam delivered a solid March quarter and continued to demonstrate strong execution in a challenging near-term industry environment. Key metrics including revenue, gross margin and operating income margin, all came in above the midpoint of guidance that we gave on our last earnings call. EPS of $3.70 exceeded the high-end of our range helped by a favorable tax rate and the benefit of ongoing share repurchases. This performance and continued execution in the business is attributable to the support of our customers and partners, and as always, the exceptional efforts of Lam employees around the world.","Turning now to our perspective on the current industry environment and outlook. Industry conditions are directionally unchanged from our January call. We continue to expect customer WFE spending for calendar year 2019 to be in the low $40 billion. Though since our last call, we now see a marginal downtick in Memory spending offset by slightly better expectations in Foundry and Logic. Also consistent with our prior commentary, we expect Memory supply growth as we exit 2019 to be below the long-term demand trend line for both, NAND and DRAM.","In DRAM we continue to believe the spending correction will extend through this calendar year as customers continue to rationalize long-term profitability with near-term focus on reducing channel inventories and bringing supply and demand dynamics into balance business [ph]. In NAND, recent industry data indicates that bit shipments where better than normal seasonal trends for the February month, and we continue to believe that market conditions are setting up well for future recovery as demand and supply balance improves through the year.","On the Foundry and Logic side 2019 WFE spending is slightly higher than our prior baseline as customers appear to be ramping leading etch notes faster than we previously forecast which we believe is partly due to increased semiconductor content in smartphones related to 5G. While predicting the exact timing of cyclical change is always difficult, our confidence in the long-term demand drivers for Lam's business is unchanged. We're positioning Lam to capitalize on long-term demand through execution on our three growth vectors of served available market expansion, share gains, and revenue generation from our installed base.","Semiconductor demand drivers such as Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence, 5G and IoT are creating compelling served available market expansion opportunities for Lam; all require innovations in the transmission, processing and storage of data using a minimum number of computed cycles at lower power and lower costs. This is leading to changes in compute system architecture and driving growth in new on-chip and off-chip memory designs. Key trends include the use of high-bandwidth memory interfaces for leading accelerator designs, heterogeneous integration for system on chip solution, and the move to MRAM for embedded memories.","I would like to provide a few specific examples of how Lam is set to benefit from these trends. First, new memory devices like GDDR6 improved bandwidth by adding among other things more bit lines which increases etching deposition intensity. Second, high-bandwidth memory and heterogeneous packaging integration are driving an increased need for through-silicon vias and other novel wafer level packaging technologies. Lam's SABRE 3D electroplating and Syndion etch tools are recognized technology and market leaders in the TSV market and provides a stable etch depth and VSL capability required for high-volume production. For wafer level packaging, the market-leading SABRE 3D system delivers technology-enabling co-planarity on our production-proven platform.","And third, emerging memory devices such as MRAM are employing novel materials which require the introduction of new ion beam etch technology. Lam's ion-beam etch technology is differentiated by it's control over both, ion energy and angle to deliver superior device profiles and ultimately increased yield and bit density for our customers. Broadly, we believe the product and services portfolio of Lam Research is unmatched in it's fit to these emerging technology inflections, and our focus is to deliver disruptive customer-enabling technologies to expand our served available market.","From a market share perspective, we continue to perform well on penetration and defense activities. In the first calendar quarter, we successfully defended all key positions in addition to winning multiple new opportunities, and we remain committed to our goal of growing market share in both, etch and deposition. Our confidence in our share gain opportunity is rooted in fundamental product architecture and technology differentiation. Lam's unique quad-station model or QSM is rapidly becoming the process chamber architecture of choice for 3D NAND. The QSM serves as the core high-productivity platform on which Lam's process teams build differentiated 3D NAND Technology Solutions. Examples where the QSM is delivering a capability advantage for our customers include our market-leading films for the ON-ON (ph) STACK, wafer bow management using backside deposition, new ALD films for high-aspect ratio gap fill, and low-resistivity tungsten fill for word line.","Our ability to deliver compelling technology and productivity including fab-space saving using the QSM architecture is unparalleled. We hit a milestone this quarter with our 7,000 module shipped, a metric that signifies the growing importance of this platform for 3D NAND and other markets.","In Logic and Foundry, gate contacts and interconnect layers require new materials for better device performance, reliability and scaling beyond 10-nanometer. In recent engagements we have shown our ability to leverage Lam's long-held leadership position in copper electroplating to win applications for new materials such as cobalt as leading etch notes. And in Memory, we continue to penetrate key semi-critical etch positions through our focus on productivity innovation. An example of this focus is the separate press release we issued today stating that in partnership with a leading semiconductor manufacturer we have successfully demonstrated one full year of uninterrupted production on Kiyo Etch System equipped with a unique productivity focused hardware set. We believe the Kiyo Etch System utilizing our Corvus R technology ushers in a new era of self-maintaining equipment.","Today's announcement is also a demonstration of Lam's commitment to leverage Industry 4.0 technologies, advanced computing and Big Data to bring innovative products and services to our customers.","And finally, in our Customer Support Business Group, we saw continued sequential growth in revenues we drive from our installed base. Our Reliant Systems business grew strongly in the March quarter reaching it's highest quarterly revenue level in our history. This was driven primarily by investments in non-leading etch notes in Foundry, as well as spending on more and more in IoT initiatives. Overall, our installed base business is on-track to deliver another record year, growing again at a rate faster than the installed base.","In summary, Lam is well positioned to capitalize on the long-term demand drivers in the semiconductor industry. We are performing well in a challenging near-term industry environment. And by continuing to focus on execution and investing to meet our growth objectives, we believe we will emerge stronger as WFE spending recovers.","With that let me turn the call over to Doug for his prepared remarks.","Doug Bettinger","Great. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings season. Lam executed well in the March quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics.","Earnings per share exceeded the high-end of the guidance range that we provided mainly due to a lower tax rate that we realized in the quarter. We had a more favorable tax benefit from our annual employee stock grant investing due to the increase in our stock price during the March quarter. I'd also like to highlight that during the March quarter our cash from operations came in at $933 million which on a quarterly basis is the second highest cash generation in the history of Lam Research.","As we discussed during our last quarter earnings call, we believe WFE spending for the first half of 2019 would reflect lower memory spending levels and spending would be driven more by Foundry and Logic investments. Our view today is largely unchanged. Full year 2019 Foundry and Logic WFE might be a little bit stronger than we expected a quarter ago, and DRAM might be a little bit weaker. We continue to expect WFE will be down in the mid to high-teens percent year-over-year from 2018. WFE spending as a percentage of semi-industry profit dollars has been running at a fairly consistent level over the last several years. We continue to track a double-digit number of new fab projects this year spending leading etch Foundry, Memory and IoT driven legacy notes.","Overall, Lam's system revenue for the combined Memory segment decreased to 61% of total system's revenue from the 79% we saw in the December quarter. The composition of the Memory segment was mostly driven by conversions and included non-volatile Memory spending at 40% and DRAM spending at 21%. NAND spending continues to be focused on both, 6x and 9x layer wafers, and DRAM spending is focused on the 1x and 1y notes. The Foundry segment more than doubled quarter-over-quarter accounting for 27% of system revenue which is the highest level in Foundry we've seen since March of 2017. Foundry spending in 2019 is focused on 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer. As a comparison the profile in 2017 was target at 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer notes. And finally, the Logic and other segment was also up contributing 12% of systems revenue.","Let's turn to the P&L performance for the March quarter. We delivered revenues of $2.439 billion which was down slightly from the December quarter and above the midpoint of the March guidance we've provided. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.1%; we came in slightly better-than-expected, primarily due to product mix and spending control. And as I always do, I'll remind you that our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, and you should expect to see variability quarter-over-quarter.","Operating expenses in the March quarter were $488 million which increased by approximately 11% from the prior quarter. Spending in the March quarter was negatively impacted by the appreciation of the stock market during the quarter and the resulting impact on the cost of our deferred compensation plan. We do hedge this to mitigate the exposure; however the offset to this expense shows up in other income and expense. It's neutral to earnings per share at the end of the day. R&D investments continue to be a focus for us with R&D comprising nearly two-thirds of our spending in the March quarter. In June total operating expenses are expected to be lower on a sequential basis compared to the March quarter.","I'd also just point out one spending item that you'll see in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation table of our press release. We incurred a charge of approximately $11 million related to severance payments for a workforce action we took during the March quarter. Operating income in the March quarter was $611 million and operating margin was 25.1%, pretty much in line with the midpoint of the guidance range. The non-GAAP tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 8% which is lower than our long-term rate due to the tax benefits related to the employee stock investing that I described earlier. For the June quarter in 2019 calendar year, we continue to expect the tax rate in the low to mid-teens and there will be fluctuations in this rate quarter-by-quarter.","In March we completed the issuance of $2.5 billion in principal value of senior notes as we decided to take advantage of a favorable interest rate and credit environment. The note proceeds are for general corporate purposes including among other things to fund our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends. For other income and expense, our newly issued debt added approximately $8 million in interest expense for the March quarter. However as I pointed out, this was offset in OINE by gains on assets related to obligations under our deferred compensation plan.","Going forward, we expect to have approximately $26 million of quarterly interest expense related to our new debt. In total, interest expense on a quarterly basis is now around $45 million. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to capital return during the quarter funding more than $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases. For the March quarter we paid out $171 million in dividends and we completed $862 million in share buybacks through a combination of open market and structured repurchases. These repurchases were made under the new $5 billion authorization that we announced at our earnings call in January.","And I'd just point out to you that in the last year we have lowered quarterly diluted share count by approximately 20 million shares; that's over 11% reduction. Earnings per share came in at $3.70 which was over our guidance range for the March quarter, mainly driven by that favorable tax rate. Diluted shares per EPS were 158 million shares which reflects a decrease from the September quarter related to the share buyback program. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the remaining 2041 convertible notes in the March quarter. And I'll remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.","Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash increased notably in the March quarter to $6.4 billion from $3.9 billion in the prior quarter. This was driven by the $2.5 billion debt issuance that I mentioned, and the over $900 million operational cash flow. DSO improved by six days to 61 days. Our inventory levels decreased and consequently inventory turns increased to 3.4 times compared to 3.2 times in the prior quarter. Company non-cash expenses included approximately $53 million for equity compensation, $46 million for depreciation and $36 million for amortization.","Capital expenditures were $76 million in the March quarter which was a decrease from $106 million in the December quarter. Due the timing of certain projects December quarter CapEx was somewhat on the high side and the decrease in the March quarter was in line with our expectations. The majority of the CapEx in March was directed towards investment supporting our installed base business. We exited the March quarter with approximately 10,800 regular full-time employees which is down slightly from the prior quarter due to the workforce action that I previously mentioned. For the long-term we continue to prioritize headcount that is supporting Lam's SAM expansion, market share gains, and installed base business growth.","Looking ahead, I'd now like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the June 2019 quarter. We're expecting revenues of $2.350 billion, plus or minus $150 million; gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus one percentage point; operating margins of 26%, plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $3.40, plus or minus $0.20 based on the share count of approximately 155 million shares.","Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, this is Adaa (ph) calling in for John. I was wondering if you could maybe talk through what your OpEx trajectory is looking like for the remainder of the year given the lumpiness that we saw in March?","Doug Bettinger","Yes. I mean we only really guide this one quarter at that time. The best -- I guess, the way I would give you to think about it is, it's going to be plus or minus where we're at in the June quarter. But again, we only formally guided numerically one quarter at a time.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. And then, if you could maybe provide us with an updated view of the domestic China opportunity where you think that looks like this year in terms of WFE and then your puts and takes around that given the macro situation?","Tim Archer","Sure, I can do that. We said on our last call actually that we had expected China domestic WFE this year to be little more -- greater than $5 billion, we haven't changed our view on that. And our position in China, we've also said is a bit stronger or at least as strong as elsewhere in the world, so we gave guidance on the last call that our business in domestic China would be up as well. You know, there really has been also no change in the regulatory environment that is impacting our results and while we're monitoring it closely, we don't really expect any effect on our business at this point.","Operator","We will now take a question from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you had given the backdrop of weak pricing across both segments in Memory; I think it's a great job on your part in terms of getting what I imagine roughly $1 billion plus per quarter in total shipments just on technology buzz alone. And so I guess the question is, as you look into the back half of the year and you think about the transition 96-layer and if we take into account what we've heard from ASML in terms of a second half ramp (inaudible). How should we think about that trajectory? Are there green chutes there into the back half for the year or is that something that would shine in the first half of 2019 -- 2020, sorry?","Doug Bettinger","Yes. Tim and I will take it a little bit I think. You know, C.J. our outlook isn't really changed at all from what we communicated at earnings a quarter ago. We don't see a recovery in Memory this year, we do think it sets up well for -- what -- likely happens in 2020. We expect the exit rate of supply in both, NAND and DRAM to be under where demand is, meaning it's consuming some of the inventory which I think sets us up well, but we really don't see a meaningful recovery or recovery at all this year. Tim, you want to add anything?","Tim Archer","No, I think that's -- it's a very clear statement of our position. We've been saying that we really don't see the recovery this year. You mentioned a couple of other items though like the 96-layer conversion and I guess from the standpoint of the job we're doing, you know, Lam is squarely focused in the middle of technology conversations and technology conversions are great way for customers to reduce their cost, increase their capability through cycles like this. And so Lam is just focused on helping our customers execute those technology conversions and when they come and there is capacity additions that will be as you say an additional green chute. But right now we've said, we don't see that right now through this year.","Doug Bettinger","And C.J., just maybe one more comment from me. As I've said here and I think -- I do know it recovers at some point whether it's later in this year or early next year to me is somewhat interesting from a timing standpoint but obviously it will recover at some point. The industry is working through inventory in the channel and that will take some time, and at some point investment will be more than it is right now.","C.J. Muse","Okay, very helpful. And as a follow-up; considering the magnitude of the debt offering in the quarter can you kind of walk through what net cash or gross cash rather you need to run the business? And are you contemplating perhaps a more aggressive buyback with the funds? Thank you.","Tim Archer","Yes. C.J., nothing new to communicate relative to the buyback. We just announced the $5 billion a quarter ago, we executed $862 million last quarter, we view this as a favorable debt market as I described in my prepared remarks relative to rates and credit demand and whatnot, we've decided to take advantage of that. It really doesn't impact too much how I'm thinking about the timing of the buyback, the quantum of the buyback. Obviously, I think we've been pretty judicious with returning cash to shareholders in the past and will continue to do so in the future but I don't really have anything new to tell you except that that debt issuance helps fund what we plan to do. Thanks C.J.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik","Hi, thanks for taking my question and good job in a tough environment. Tim, I have a question on your market share. We all understand and WFE share is a complicated mix of end market, your customer mix; the Gartner data came out today and it shows your WFE share declined modestly last year. I just wanted to understand moving forward as EUV becomes a little bit bigger push and off the Logic spending, what are the things that you can do with your products that can offset -- kind of the natural headwind from EUV?","And then looking beyond one to two years, when I was at SPIE Conference, there was a lot of discussion on horizontal nanotubes or nanosheets being used for 3-nanometer Logic devices similar to what we have seen from 2D to 3D NAND migration. So just your thoughts in terms of when your Logic share can start to improve because of architectural changes? Thank you.","Tim Archer","Okay, sure. Lot of great questions in there, so I'll do my best. I mean, first, maybe just taking kind of the share question head-on. Obviously we looked at the Gartner report, note, we will be the first to acknowledge we don't win everything we compete for. But I want to point out, we feel -- when we think about market share we feel very good about what we've accomplished in last few years relative to our positions in critical applications. You know, critical applications are the hardest to win but once you have them, they are also the stickiest; I mean they are the applications that our customers are least likely to change. And -- so we really did, we focused on those and we made sure that in key fast-growing segments of WFE like 3D NAND, we made sure that we secured those critical applications because that's really the foundation on which we then can go build everything else. And those are the applications that get you closely collaborating with customers.","I think when you think about share, I've said -- I said it last time and I'll say it again, I want us to do better in the semi-critical applications. But again, yet after the critical application foundation first, then you build semi-critical on top of that. What can we do in that area? A lot of that is you just saw in this press release. We're focused on productivity innovation, and as our customer scale up and you see it this year with focus on the pricing environment and spending environment in the Memory, productivity innovation is welcomed by our customers. So semi-critical is usually a battlefield of our productivity, the press release about the Kiyo Etch with Corvus R. I think Lam will continue to try to set benchmarks for productivity in this space and that will drive share for us.","Those are all things that are within our control. Things that are not so much within our control; device mix, and so just to point out as you look at some element of spending last year what took place was that 2017 to 2018 saw a significant increase in DRAM WFE and not such a large increase in -- in fact, almost no increase in NAND WFE by our calculation. So again, based on choices we've made in strategic positioning, we have positioned Lam to be extremely strong in 3D NAND and I think you all know that. And so some years it will go -- some years it doesn't work out quite as well. Now -- but we feel really good, and quite honestly, I wouldn't trade our position we have right now for anybody else's.","Now your point about Logic, kind of -- just finish on that one. We intend to improve, we're always investing to improve our position across the entire spectrum of applications. I'm not -- I won't play my (ph) expert on your 3-nanometer horizontal nanosheet's application note but we have our CTO office looking at every new inflection that comes and those inflections how we've proven our ability to use those inflections as a share gain opportunities for ourselves and we'll continue to do so. So hopefully that answers your question. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go to a question from Patrick Ho with Stifel.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Tim, maybe first off in terms of the 2019 outlook. You detailed about the memory outlook remaining pretty much muted through the rest of this year. I guess what are some of the key variables the investors should look out for whether it be in NAND and DRAM, is it just the pricing environment? Is it the inventory situation? What are some of the key variables that you guys are monitoring that will lead to a change or a turn in positive spending for the Memory market?","Tim Archer","Okay. Yes, I mean it's a great question. I mean, it's one we're asking ourselves all the time, every day. Our customers have a much better view on what their strategies are and what the trigger points are for them to begin investing. But what we're trying to say is that at least from our view what's happening right now is very rational, I mean the pricing environment -- we've seen some talk about taking small amounts of capacity offline, these are all things that we believe will accelerate in improvement in the supply-and-demand balance. So we just watch -- we're watching those, we're talking to customers continuously. And what we're making sure is that regardless as Doug said, we know it's going to come back, I talked about a lot of the demand drivers. There is no question for us about when -- whether Memory comes back, and so we're just focused on staying close to customers and making sure that when they do want to place orders for tools, there is no limitation in our ability to ship to them on the dates they want the systems.","Doug Bettinger","Patrick, this is Doug. How I think about it is that I think we all understand there is inventory in the channel, there is inventory with the hyperscale guys, there is inventory with our customers that needs to clear itself out. And we can all do our best to model that, you can do it as well as we can; obviously, we model it, I know you do too. To me when I think about pricing, pricing is an indication of how supply and demand are clearing and until all the inventory is worked out, a lot of what you're seeing in pricing will be determined by how that inventory is moving through the channel; so you got to pay attention to that because that tells you how things are clearing out. And as Tim said, at some point it will clear up and we're all waiting to see when that does.","Patrick Ho","Right. And as my follow-up question for you Doug; I know you've talked about the installed base business as being kind of a hidden growth driver for the Company and we've seen it now over the last couple of years. Can you just qualitatively perhaps give a little bit of color of both where the leading edges installed base continues to grow obviously with more shipments to 3D NAND and that front, as well as some of the opportunities on a trailing etch where you're saying upgrades, productivity improvements. Can you just give a little bit of color of how much that installed base growth is driven from both, leading etch versus trailing etch?","Doug Bettinger","I mean a lot of it Patrick is leading-etch stuff, right, that tends to be the most technically complex chambers we have in the field and as a result it tends to consume more spare parts than stuff that's out in the field. But as we've talked about in the past, our tools will run for decades, that's a great part about this business, and this part of the business model is -- things need to be upgraded, things need to be maintained, they all need spare parts on a regular basis. At some point one customer might be done with the tool, he will buy it back, refurbish it, sell it to somebody else; so there is a very long tail to the profit generation from the stuff in the field, that's how I think about it. And we've described this in the past as being roughly a quarter of the company's business. Now in a year like this year when new equipment sales are down as much as it is, it will be more than that obviously, likely this year well north of 30%. And so that's a great part of the business this year is, this is actually growing this year Patrick; so it just keeps going. Tim, would you add anything?","Tim Archer","Yes, I think the only thing I would add is, maybe even to reinforce Doug's point about the performance in this business this year; this is the kind of business that quite often when our customers are looking for opportunities to increase their capability without having to go to that next increment which is to actually add capacity which is definitely their mindset right now this year. They turn to us for productivity upgrades, capability upgrades, services that help them get more out of the existing installed base and that's what this whole business is intended to do, is to help them leverage the tools that they've already put in place and probably it's kind of a win-win but it means that in the year like this year it's a very good business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you very much. So I had two. I guess, Tim first, I wanted to dovetail on the answer that you've just had. And obviously, you guys are a great leverage to 3D NAND but I still get a lot of questions sort of on capital intensity and what your share is of the wallet in the layer migration world versus kind of a planner to a 3D conversion world. So, can you sort of help us baseline that sort of per 1K or per 10K; how much you think the WFE spending is and what's your capture is of that wallet?","Tim Archer","What I'd -- here is what I'd say; I mean, it's a great question and maybe I'll refer back to few other things we've said, and we can then see how close we can get to the level of detail you're looking for. Obviously, we participate as you're talking specifically for layer conversions and 3D NAND; we participate quite significantly in the technologies that are required to make the stack taller, right, basically to increase the density. So we're talking about going from say 64-layer to 96-layer. I don't believe and Doug can correct me if we have, but I don't believe we've actually quantified exactly what we think our share of that spend is externally.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, we haven't quantified it numerically.","Tim Archer","Clearly, we've done it internally, we understand that all. What we did show at the Investor Day last year was that -- obviously for a greenfield investment Lam's opportunity increases meaningfully at every layer of transition as you might expect. I mean you're building a taller stack and it's the taller stacks, deeper etches, the new films that -- I mentioned one; you know, when you get to a taller stack, these new films are required to control wafer bow (ph), are critical to being able to build those taller stacks on the wafer and still be able to process and yield the wafer. Those things do increase capital intensity for us when you're moving between layers. I think the other piece though that we did mention at Investor Day and I guess we can reiterate is that -- from a conversion perspective while the absolute dollars spent are less, our share of wallet as you'd say, our share of WFE actually increases quite significantly because the primary tools that are required to affect that layer transition are etch and depth heavy.","And so in a year like this when most of the attention is turned towards conversion it becomes a year in which maybe we would be achieving and obtaining a higher share of total spend in that area. But I know that doesn't quantify for you, but I don't believe we've done that externally, probably not prepared to do so today.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks, Tim. Yes, that was kind of where I was getting at, just layer migration versus the 2D to 3D world. So, thank you for that. And then Doug, just a quick follow-up; so on free cash flow payout I think you paid a little more than all of your free cash flow this quarter. Is that still the sort of payout all of your free cash flow going forward? And I guess the question really is on repo and how opportunistic you were when the stock was lower versus now that the stock is higher? Thanks.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Tim. I mean our formally committed metric that we are committed to return is I think we did this at our Analyst Day last year is at least 50% of the free cash flow and your observation is exactly right, last quarter it was more than 100% and the last several years it's been close to 100%. The way I think about it is, we are opportunistic, we are sensitive to what we perceive fair value of our business to be and where things are trading, we announced at our last earnings call a new authorization, $5 billion, I didn't communicate the timeframe for that and we'll see as it goes. But obviously the fact that in the June quarter year regarding the share count down again, you know we're going to be the market again in June and I've described it as I think about it as being opportunistic. I'm not going to exactly say what that means but we do pay attention to the value of the stock as we're executing.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.","Krish Sankar","Hi, thanks for taking my question, I have two of them. First one, Tim just to touch upon the market share last year; it looks like you guys did lose some share, especially on dielectric etch (ph) in NAND versus tail and my understanding was that tail is going to two of the customers because of productivity. Just trying to figure out -- I mean, maybe the press release we had was probably related to that. Is there a way that loss can be stemmed or do you think your share gains in the more challenging channel whole etches will more than offset any weakness in the flip etch? And then I'll had a follow-up question for Doug.","Tim Archer","Well, I'm not going to talk about any specific applications but in general, my comments about semi-critical applications where both your technical capability to do the application as well as productivity are if not equally important certainly like in the mix of the decision that's an area where obviously it's more competitive. And what I'm basically messaging is, our Company is going to focus on delivering best-in-class products that are best-in-class both, for technology and productivity. In many areas we already do that, I talked about the QSM, the deposition tool for -- like the strata ON-ON tool; in terms of productivity it delivered the 3D NAND on many dimensions, cost per wafer, fab space per wafer out. These are all dimensions we're -- as we said we believe we're unparalleled in terms of productivity delivered. Some of the etch applications; we may have some room to go and so when you say can it be stemmed; it's an area of focus for us and I think our track record of both, equipment and process development in critical application demonstrates we have the capability to do it, we have the productivity know-how inside the company to do it as well, and though I will say I'm not overly concerned but it is somewhat coming from our strategy if we needed to ensure we were securing critical applications that will continue to pay -- offer us for many years to come first and I think now we can definitely take on some of the challenges we've had in semi-critical.","Krish Sankar","Got it, that's helpful Tim. And then a follow-up for Doug. If I look at your OpEx and try to normalize it on a weekly basis given that March had an extra week in the quarter; it looks like the OpEx run rate really hasn't changed, it looks like it's about $35 million on a weekly basis. But you guys did takeout 150 headcount, so I'm just wondering was it more flexing on the COGS side or should we expect maybe a downside to OpEx going forward?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, I mean the best I'll give you prospectively is that we just got the June quarter. I don't know what it will be precisely, I'm not going to tell you September and December and beyond. What I said in response to an earlier question is the best guidance to give you is plus or minus where we are in June. And I think, Krish, in the first half of the year you have some unique things that happened the first, you're absolutely right, it was our 14-week quarter that occurs every six years, something like six years. We have that elective deferred compensation program, drive spending up that was offset in OINE. I don't anticipate that happens again, but if the market significantly moves you will see some permutations for things like that.","In the first half of the year also you get payroll taxes come in that go away later in the year. So that dynamic comes and goes and then quite honestly with our R& D spending it's based on programs and projects and schedules and it's not perfectly linear, it's not the same every single quarter, there will be some lumpiness to that and that's why we'll guide you quarter-by-quarter as we go. We're conscious of the profitability of the Company, obviously we're conscious of wanting to maintain that profitability, it's why we undertook the workforce action we did.","And the last thing I'd say is, part of that workforce action Krish was in cost of goods sold, it wasn't just in direct spending. So there is lots of things moving around.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Nice job on the quarterly execution. We're going to see the focus on semi-critical layer applications. The market doesn't tend to focus here a whole lot but there appears to be a lot of opportunity here as you mentioned where the team can win on attributes like productivity, reliability, tool footprint and all of this obviously have a significant impact on overall wafer cost for your customers. So, of the share gain targets that you guys have set forth in your 2021 model how much of this share capture is due to winning semi-critical applications?","Doug Bettinger","We haven't quantified it Harlan but a piece of it certainly is, a piece of it certainly is. And you know when I think about it is and what I hear Tim say all the time is, obviously, productivity is a technology challenge, right. The most productive platform doesn't necessarily mean the cheapest, it doesn't, right? You innovate in productivity, you innovate with the architectures as Tim talked about. You can win business at nice profitability which is what we're aspiring to do.","Tim Archer","Yes, it's a great question. Some element of it, I mean in many ways you're improving performance even on critical when you're working on things like artificial differentiation for semi-critical, so this isn't where you need to drive completely different attributes. I think it's just a natural part, especially in the 3D NAND space actually -- of how the technology has also evolved and matured as well. I mean, if you go back a couple of years ago, maybe there was a lot more focus on the technical enablement of 3D NAND, it meant a lot more applications looked critical. And I think now as it's matured we figure out which ones we can push the boundaries of our throughput and cost reduction in a way that we can make 3D NAND lower cost for our customers to produce and therefore maybe drive increased volume, I mean basically through elasticity.","So it's a focus of ours and like I said it's not something new; I mean the -- many of the deposition applications for a long time have competed in the semi-critical space and that's why you see unique tool plans that bring back up the QSM, architectural differentiation specifically for productivity, it's a winner. The Kiyo Etch and Corvus R announcement; Doug's point about almost every cost problem requires a technology solution, now that's a technology solution, I mean it may sound easy but the idea of a tool that can replace it's own hardware without human intervention, that's a technology solution to a cost and productivity problem. And I think it's just the first example of the types of things that we want to drive out of our technology organization focused on cost.","Harlan Sur","Thanks for the insights there. And then as my follow-up, as your Memory customers continue to focus on profitability and free cash flow, they started off by cutting CapEx, now they are limiting supply to the market by building inventory and then more recently idealing (ph) capacity or even cutting wafer starts. I mean, now that utilization in fab activity does drive a part of your installed base business and so wondering if you can comment on whether or not you expect to see any potential impact of these customer actions on your services business on a go-forward basis?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, maybe a little bit Harlan. Honestly, as I think you well know, our spares consumption often -- well, not often is correlated with fab utilization; so if utilization comes down the consumption of spare parts will reduce a bit. Independent of that, we still see a nice growth here for the installed base. We still are going to deliver record levels of revenue and profits in that part of the business. So yes, we're still feeling great about what's going on. Tim, anything?","Tim Archer","No, no. I think I'd just point you back to the comment I made. The utilization portion that was what Doug was commenting on, obviously some work dependence there on utilization to things like spares and consumables etcetera. But I made the comment which I think is also shouldn't be lost; it's in years like this the customers are looking to us to help them improve the productivity of their installed tools through upgrades and services, and so you maybe getting a little bit of a balance between those two elements of our installed base business and that's why even in face of this business we're telling you we'll deliver a record year in installed base.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Westin [ph] with KeyBanc.","Unidentified Analyst","I actually wanted to follow-up on the installed base business. I'm wondering that if you have a significant slowdown until shipments this year; does that impact your installed base revenue growth trajectory next year and come more importantly, does it put that 2021 target model at risk?","Tim Archer","No, we're still tracking to where we want to be relative to the growth drivers in this business. You're right, if the growth of chambers slows there will be a lag effect to the growth of the installed base business but we're still feel really good about where we're headed here.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, you talk about the self-maintenance chamber, that's sounds really interesting. I'm wondering who would be the typical customer and is that something that could help you accelerate revenue growth next year as the Memory CapEx begins to recover?","Doug Bettinger","Well that's what we're doing. Yes, obviously it could apply to all applications; it's first application here was in a Memory focused etch application, and I think that we -- just again, it will be more sensitive to places where you're wanting to manage very high-volume production with minimal human intervention. I mean what it really does is, it allows us to not have to interrupt the tool by opening into replaced arps (ph). And so I guess any high-volume application could be a target for it. If it's successful as it's proving out right now then sure it represents a share gain opportunity for us, and therefore better position when spending recovers.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, that's helpful. Just to clarify, so you think there will be a product in the marketplace next year helping generate revenue growth?","Tim Archer","Yes.","Doug Bettinger","Westin, it's in the market right now.","Tim Archer","Yes, that was the announcement whether it is manufacturing and manufacturing right now high-volume in manufacturing.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mitchell Steves with RBC.","Mitchell Steves","First one, during your prepared remarks you guys stated that you saw a little bit more softening in DRAM; but then you didn't have a comment on NAND. So my reason is mostly in between lines, I think maybe NAND price is bottoms high of DRAM or is that I guess a bad assumption to make?","Tim Archer","I mean, it's just read it be our outlook for NAND is unchanged.","Mitchell Steves","Okay, got it. And then secondly in terms of the China demand right now. And obviously has been a lot of growth in terms of what the impact has been between the tariffs. So (inaudible) kind of quantify the impact of the tariffs U.S.?","Tim Archer","Well, if you mean specifically the impact of the tariffs on Lam results -- what we have said is that we've been able to mitigate close to the point that they are included and reported in our financials and their part of our guidance and then I would say that they have been very minimal impact at this point.","Doug Bettinger","How to mitigate what might have occurred Mitch. It's gotten material impact on anything you're seeing from us right now.","Operator","We'll now go to a question from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Tim, I'm wondering how is the visibility and outlook for the second half now versus what have thought quarter ago. We have heard from some of the Memory customers that they are expecting some optimism about the second half but the inventory situation is not getting much better. So I'm just wondering how you're looking at the second half what's on your dashboard as you look at visibility and at what point do you think you will be shipping demand? Has that view changed in the last quarter or so?","Tim Archer","Yes, it's a great question. We have been -- I mean where do we look at, I mean, we're said in constant contact with our customers. The message we delivered today and are delivering on this call is that there a year is playing out pretty much as we stated on the last call which is we cheese no meaningful recovery in Memory spending through this year. And we exit with supply growth meaningfully below the long-term demand both in DRAM and NAND. And so we have said 2019 is a year in nature kind of the balance of supply and demand and then inventory issues gets resolved in away that we exit the year and are set up for a much stronger outlook in 2020. That's what we said in January. I guess I'd say we just are a reiterating that we still see it playing out that way. And that's how we're looking at it.","Doug Bettinger","Yes, we'll give you one follow-up. Operator just a heads-up we have a time after this for one more call.","Vivek Arya","So very quickly, I don't know whether you answered it before. But what's the sensitivity of the services business to what you're seeing on those businesses. So you will mean historically to see our historically does it mean services go down next year or do you think that enough growth in the installed base and consumables to still have conceptually a positive year consummately positive year next year?","Doug Bettinger","We that when we look at this we see this is a growth year for the installed base business and it will grow next year too.","Operator","We'll take a question from Mehdi Hosseini (ph) with SIG.","Unidentified Analyst","All the good questions have you asked. I just have one quick follow-up. When you talk about Logic and Foundry, and others, does that include advanced packaging and image sensors? And if not what does that put in which pocket?","Doug Bettinger","Yes, Mehdi for us it's Logic and Other as you rightly pointed out. So yes, that's where image sensors goes, that's where advanced packaging goes, it's Logic plus everything else.","Unidentified Analyst","When you talk about a slight upside to Logic and Foundry, would that include better-than-expected advanced packaging and image sensors?","Doug Bettinger","That's not what's driving the upside and spending that we're seeing, it's more leading etch stuff.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time I will turn the conference back to Ms. Tina Correia for any additional or closing remarks.","Tina Correia","Thank you all for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"12950":["Lam Research Corp.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Odette Go, Treasurer for Lam Research. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Odette Marie Go - Lam Research Corp.","Thank you. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, Chief Executive Officer, and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, we will share our outlook on the business environment, review our financial results for the June 2018 quarter, and our outlook for the September 2018 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 PM Pacific Time this afternoon. It can be also found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.","Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factor disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information.","Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 PM Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.","With that, let me hand the call over to Martin.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Good afternoon. I've firmly established that Lam is the priority of contributing to the success of our customers through the increased strategic relevance of our product and services portfolio. Ultimately, this focus is measured by our financial performance and the June quarter financial results were outstanding. Worthy of note, we achieved the milestone of revenues exceeding $3 billion and non-GAAP operating income of approximately $1 billion.","Short-term performance is not simply our goal, however. We have delivered and we aspire to continue to reward our stakeholders with multi-year industry outperformance measured by competing for and winning a greater proportion of our customers' investments; greater in quantity and greater in quality through the degree of codependency and annuity.","In this context, we also concluded the strongest fiscal year in our history by delivering approximately $11 billion in revenues, representing growth of almost 40%, $3.4 billion in non-GAAP operating income, and $2.7 billion in cash from operations.","At this point of our journey, I would like to thank our customers, our employees, and our partners for their active support and confidence in the company. Our intense focus on technology and productivity leadership, operational execution, and a genuine model of collaboration, we believe, are together the essential foundations for an exciting long-term future.","Well-published at this point, customer equipment investment spending has softened near term as industry participants continue to strive for discipline and sustainability in their businesses. While it is true to say that the short-term headlines reflect themselves in lower calendar Q3 guidance than we were anticipating earlier, we consider the change a strong, positive long-term influence.","We offer the following perspectives. While not true for every customer, the segments of memory and foundry have both seen, although for different reasons, some reduction in equipment's demand short-term, but the largest single adjustments occurred in DRAM.","We now plan overall 2018 WFE up year-over-year in the single-digit range. We expect the September quarter to be the low point of our calendar year. We remain optimistic about our mid-term and long-term opportunity and continue to target Lam's outperformance this year and long-term.","With the comprehensiveness of our disclosure earlier this year in our Investor and Analyst Meeting combined with the abundance of disclosure from other industry participants on the increasing role of silicon, the increasing role of data, and the acceleration of innovation in the cognitive computing environment, there's not so much more to add currently.","Bottom line, our customers have inspirational ambition and we exist to support them. Arguably, there's not been a more exciting time in our industry in decades and the intensity of focus at Lam to mitigate risks and maximize strategic opportunities combined, we believe, to create a compelling editorial.","While it is true to say that our customers have never invested more absolute dollars in their future, with the recent device ASP trends, they are investing a lower proportion of their annual profits and in any point of the last 15 years. That is the new industry and new value proposition headline that we have cited on several occasions now.","We noted last quarter that we expected low double-digit WFE growth in 2018 and a first half, second half shipments allocation in the low 50s, high 40s, with revenues a little more balanced. We now expect single-digit WFE growth, with the adjustments reflecting themselves primarily in the September quarter. Having previously anticipated a first half, second half reduction in memory WFE of between 20% and 25%, we now expect a larger reduction, with the long-term demands trends intact.","To fully understand our September business volume trajectory, the following headlines that underpin our belief in the extraordinary value proposition of memory strength long-term are important. We have the confidence in the long-term value and opportunity because memory and storage is increasingly prominent in the computer and systems integration roadmaps of the industry with fundamental and broadening demand drivers.","Analytically, that reflects itself in the trailing seven-year cumulative growth rate for memory WFE, which is approximately 10 times greater than the equivalent logic foundry CAGR.","Similarly, since 2013, memory WFE as a percentage of total WFE has trended from 40% to 60%, with the corresponding etch and deposition memory markets growing faster and to a higher level. This is our SAM expansion commentary. Considering these data points and the approximate 25% contribution from our installed base business, our September quarter guidance should be quite intuitive.","Turning to some of the business headlines of the company this quarter. There should now be a greater awareness to the earnings quality delivered from our installed base business, the so-called annuity of Lam, and that is where I would like to concentrate my prepared remarks here today.","You will remember our objective to create value for customers through productivity solutions and the development of advanced services to facilitate improved value capture for Lam and growth at a pace faster than the growth of our installed base units.","Our installed base business has grown more than 2 times faster than our installed base unit growth this year, with our worldwide process chamber counts now approximately 55,000 units.","In a world where our customers' focus appropriately seeks optimal asset utilization, our reliance in reuse business recorded first half 2018 growth of approximately 50% year-over-year. This is a commentary on the broadening of our product offerings and the demand for more than more IoT and MEMS silicon capacity. As a reminder, our SAM expansion focus has three foundations today: first, fully realizing the opportunities of multi-patterning and 3D device scaling over multiple years.","Second, broadening our systems applications, and films capabilities where there is opportunity and unmet customer need, and third, increasing value creation from advanced productivity services.","On this last point, the portfolio is now quite comprehensive and harnesses the technologies of big data that we helped create. Customer engagements are now extensive, ranging from demo and evaluation to fab wide adoption. We are pleased with our progress and excited by the opportunity to increase customer value to codependency, at the same time increasing the quality of Lam Research earnings.","For the systems businesses of etch and deposition, our investments in SAM expansion, market share defense and penetration, and disruptive technologies continues at pace and we're pleased with the comprehensiveness and the complements of our technology and product roadmaps to the expectations of customers and the competitive dynamic.","In closing, this is a year characterized by the following. First, the increased prominence of silicon and in turn, the equipment industry in the creation of value for the global economy. Two, rational, disciplined spending by our customers at the highest level in history, supported by the highest revenues in profits in their industry. Three, unmatched outperformance opportunity, we believe, for Lam.","To emphasize a few key points. September P&L guidance for Lam is impacted by four things: first, the relative strength of memory and the strength of Lam in memory; second, the actions by some customers in recent weeks to adjust their short-term investment plans; and third, the implementation of new revenue recognition rules and the specifics of customer delivery and acceptance dates leading up to the new accounting policy adoption; and fourth, the variability of our operating expense cost structure without compromising our long-term focus.","Current knowledge indicates September will be the low points of our year and more importantly, the long-term trends of our industry and company, we believe, are as compelling as ever. On this last point, we look forward to sharing more of our long-term opportunities at the August 7 Flash Memory Summit conference where Rick Gottscho, our CTO, Doug, and myself will be hosting a reception.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Doug.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on what I know is a very busy earnings day.","The June quarter results represented a solid conclusion to the 2018 fiscal year. For the quarter, we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance for all financial metrics. For the fiscal year, we delivered record levels of shipments, revenues, cash from operations, gross margin dollars, operating income dollars as well as earnings per share. We're obviously very pleased with what we achieved this quarter and this fiscal year.","Shipments for the quarter were again at the $3 billion mark at $3.028 billion, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. For fiscal year 2018, shipments were $11.176 billion, which was a 30% increase compared to fiscal year 2017. Memory shipments continued to be strong in June, with the combined memory segment making up 80% of total system shipments.","Our overall non-volatile memory shipments remain strong, representing approximately 55% of the system shipments compared to 57% last quarter. DRAM shipments represented 25% of system shipments, down from 27% in the prior quarter. The foundry segment was up, accounting for 13% of system shipments relative to 10% in March. And finally, the logic and other segment contributed 7% of system shipments, just a little bit above the prior quarter's 6%.","We delivered record revenues of $3.126 billion in the June quarter, an increase of 8% from March and again slightly above the midpoint of guidance. For the fiscal year, revenues came in at $11.077 billion, which was an increase of 38% from fiscal year 2017. Our installed base business contributed approximately 25% of our revenues in the fiscal year.","Gross margin for the June quarter came in at 48%, which was up 120 basis points sequentially and the highest level in over a decade. As we shared before, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix, and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter to quarter.","Operating expenses in the quarter grew to $507 million, but decreased 60 basis points on a sequential basis to 16.2% of revenues. On a dollar basis, R&D spending grew while SG&A spending slightly declined as compared with the March quarter. R&D comprised nearly 65% of our total spending. We continue to believe that disciplined R&D investments will increase our likelihood of achieving our future revenue growth objectives.","Operating income in the June quarter came in at a record level of $994 million, up about 15% from the prior quarter. Operating margin came in close to the high end of guidance at 31.8% primarily due to the stronger gross margin performance.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the June quarter was 6.7%, in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We expect the tax rate in the low to middle teens for the remainder of calendar year 2018. In the longer run, a tax rate in the middle teens remains the right level to include in your modeling and there will be fluctuations around this quarter to quarter.","Based on a share count of approximately 175 million shares, earnings per share for the June quarter came in at $5.31, above the high end of our guided range. Primary drivers of the upside versus our guidance was the improved profitability and a little bit lower share count.","The share count includes dilution from the 2018 warrants and 2041 convertible notes, with the total dilutive impact being about 13 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. In the June quarter, our 2018 convertible note, which had a remaining balance of $172 million, matured and was settled in cash and stock. But dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.","For the June quarter, we had $6 million in early conversions for the 2041 notes. The remaining balance of the 2041 notes is $327 million and I do expect we will continue to see requests for early redemptions.","In the June quarter, we spent $1.3 billion on share repurchases. With that, we have completed almost 60% of the current $4 billion authorization and we repurchased approximately 12 million shares. We're planning to complete the remainder of the authorization over the next nine months in tandem with the expected timing of our cash repatriation. During the quarter, we be paid roughly $80 million in dividends and we also declared a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share that will be paid in the September quarter.","Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments including our restricted cash decreased in the quarter to $5.2 billion compared with $6.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, largely due to our capital return activities as well as debt repayment. In addition to retiring the 2018 convert, we also paid down approximately $640 million of commercial paper. Approximately 80% of the total $5.2 billion cash balance was offshore at the end of the quarter. Cash from operations for the June quarter was approximately $718 million, which was down slightly from over $1 billion in the March quarter.","DSO decreased by three days to 63 days. Inventory turns came in at 3.5 times compared to 3.7 times in the prior quarter. And for the fiscal year, the company has generated $2.7 billion in cash from operations. Company noncash expenses included approximately $47 million for equity comp, $40 million for amortization, and $45 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $80 million, which is up from $49 million in the March quarter. And as a reminder, we expect CapEx in 2018 to be higher compared to 2017 to support manufacturing network expansion and growth in our strategic R&D programs.","We exited the quarter with approximately 10,900 regular full-time employees. And as we previously noted, we are adopting ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard effective in fiscal 2019 which for Lam begins in the September quarter. Under ASC 606, we generally will record revenue at the time of shipment rather than at the time of customer acceptance. Under our prior accounting methodology for more than a decade, our results have shown revenue recognition lag in shipments. However, with this new accounting change, a change in shipments will essentially be equivalent to the change in revenues and adjustments in customer spending activity will have a quicker impact on our revenues and profits generally within the same quarter.","Because revenues will become more closely correlated to shipments, shipments will cease to have value as a leading indicator. As a result, we have decided to discontinue reporting shipments. With the implementation of the new revenue recognition policy coinciding with some of our customers trimming their near term investment plans, most notably in NAND, you will see the impacts right away in our next quarter's results.","Looking ahead, I'd like to provide a non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We are expecting revenues of $2.3 billion, plus or minus $150 million. We're expecting a meaningful downtick in memory spending in the September quarter.","Gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; operating margins of 26%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $3.20, plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 163 million shares.","As we sit here today, we believe the September quarter marks a near-term trough for our business. Ticking back on our messaging at our March Analyst Day, we remain very optimistic on our longer term growth prospects. We continue to believe that we have competitively differentiated products and disciplined investments that will continue to drive Lam's outperformance into the future.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a two-part question in one. Can you speak to how you're expecting the ramp of the recovery and into December? And then I guess more importantly, given this extremely rational behavior by your memory customers, how does that, I guess, make you think about the health of this industry overall and also the impact for your vision for WFE into 2019 all things equal? Thank you.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Obviously, the first part of the question, C.J., we're not going to guide December specifically in this meeting. But as Doug and I both said in our prepared comments, we do expect September to be the low point and we'll be on a positive trajectory in December. And we'll report, I guess, at that time the magnitude of it but we would not have commented if we didn't think it was material.","On the second point, I mean, it's a terrific commentary on the maturity of the industry. That the corrections happened at the pace they do and I mean, this is a pretty amazing industry at this point. If you look at kind of memory companies, their revenues are up. I think they're going to be up maybe 25% this year. After they were up 60% last year, which is a $100 billion DRAM business probably this year and the profitability levels of memory companies today are trending 40% to 50% operating income.","So there's some really nice headlines in terms of discipline and some really nice headlines in terms of profitability and sustainability and their business is a different business today. And if you kind of \u2013 if you went even higher than the memory statements and opines on the semiconductor industry holistically, in the five years 2014 to 2018 inclusive, semiconductor revenues are up by about $125 billion, if you believe in that $450 billion or a $460 billion revenue for calendar 2018. In that same timeframe, there has been an increase in wafer fabrication equipment investments by probably $18 billion in the low to the high end of that period. That means the incremental capital intensity of that 15%, I mean, that is an incredible level of efficiency of spending and a great commentary, I think, on sustainability in light of probably the most exciting set of demand drivers and the most diverse set of demand drivers we've had in a decade.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Great. Thanks, C.J.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much. I had two. I guess first thing, Doug. I wanted to ask what the guidance would have been net of ASC 606.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I'm not going to give you a specific number, Tim, but I will tell you at the end of every quarter and the 10-Q, you'll see for the next year old way and new way. I'm not going to get into guiding it because lots can change around it and I'm going to just stick to the current accounting rules. But you will be able to see it at the end of every quarter, Tim.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, awesome. Thanks. And then Martin, you made a comment when you were talking about service that it's up 50% year-over-year. Was that just a particular piece of the service business? Or were you talking about service as a whole?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I kind of attempted to deliver two messages on the installed base business. The first one is the growth of the entire installed base business which is spares and service and upgrades and training and the reliance in reuse business and that was the 2 times faster in the six months of this year than the pace of growth of the installed base units.","The second reference, which is the 50% reference you just spoke to, related to our reliance and reuse business. So I was focusing on one segment for reasons that hopefully are quite obvious.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Tim, as I was thinking about, maybe just a little color on the rev rec thing so we don't continue to get questions on it. I mean, guys, think about it in the right way. At the end of the day, this is just all timing, right? Shipments always turn into revenue, they never don't. That always happens. And so, holistically thinking about this change, it's meaningless at the end of the day. It's purely timing. It has no impact on cash flow. It has no impact on how we manage or think about the business and in the long-term, it really doesn't matter.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","And I guess, Doug, just to that point, so the shipments basically would have been about 2.3. That's kind of how to think of it, right?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","What I said was revenue and shipments are going to be much more closely correlated and we're going to stop guiding shipments as a result because it's not as useful as a leading indicator as it used to be. So we're not going to be talking about shipments anymore, Tim.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering if you could comment on the breadth of the spending base as you look into the second half. Memory companies are driving 60% gross margins and 50% operating margin profitability so very strong. Logic and foundry guys also strong profitably levels so I guess profitably is a proxy for the health of the fundamental environment. So there's really no red flags which would cause your customer base to downshift on your tech migration and capacity plans. So it seems like what you're seeing in the September quarter is more of a project shift, seems to be more maybe customer-specific and maybe limited to one or two customers. Is that kind of the right way to think about it?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","It's definitely not all customers. I mean, there are some pretty kind of selective adjustments. It's a combination of a push from September to December and a combination of some movement from the second half of this year to the first half of next year.","But I mean, everything embedded in your question, Harlan, I think we would endorse. I mean, there is a fundamental commentary of health measured by profitability and growth of the semiconductor industry as it has completely redefined it's kind of purpose and value proposition in this broader kind of data economy and ecosystem. And the long-term drivers are quite compelling. So individual companies make individual corrections. That will always be the case, and you've seen some come together in ways you haven't seen that in the past so it's a good thing, pretty short-term. We expect September to be our low point.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Harlan.","Operator","And our next question comes from Krish Shankar with Cowen.","Krish Sankar - Cowen and Company LLC","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one was on \u2013 thanks for the clarity on the December guidance or I should say September being the downtick. Is there a way to quantify what is driving the recovery in December? Is it DRAM, NAND or is it both of them?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Well, I mean, the interesting thing about the world we live in now, the value proposition that's available in the world of technology requires connectivity, it requires cloud memory and storage, and it requires computes. So there's always going to be some kind of ebbs and flows between one segment and another. But the value proposition requires investments in all.","And I think that's the fundamental headline that people should internalize. And what we've tried to do is supplement that headline with the commentary on the importance of memory in that ecosystem and the role that memory plays as an embedded component of systems and even eventually in the world of computes.","And I gave some statistics today that I'm not sure fully internalized but the CAGR of memory investment compared to the CAGR of logic and foundry investment has no comparison almost in the last five to seven years. And that's the strength of our company in many respects. So that's why we speak to unmatched opportunity because we think it's a very balanced investment and the strength of our company from a product portfolio point of view and a segments exposure creates something that's unmatched.","Krish Sankar - Cowen and Company LLC","Got you, got you. That's very helpful and if I could just have a follow-up for Doug. On the September quarter, is there a way you can give some color on the segment mix between DRAM, NAND, and foundry? And also historically, your services has been roughly, say, 25% of revenues. How much do you think it's going to be as a percentage of total revenues in the September quarter? Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yes. Krish, I'm not going to give you the exact percentage except to say that when business ticks down a little bit, the installed base really doesn't. And so it's probably going to be a little bit higher in the September quarter but I'm not going to quantify it for you. And then relative to the -- what's going on in September by segment, we don't typically get into the detail. We do that backward-looking but not necessarily forward-looking. But what you heard both Martin and I say is relative softness in memory, so you could assume there's probably some stuff going on there.","Krish Sankar - Cowen and Company LLC","Okay. Thanks, Doug. Thanks, Martin.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Krish.","Operator","And next, from Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Toshiya Hari.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Martin, you talked about 2018 WFE being up in kind of the single-digit range. As a housekeeping question, what are your updated expectations for DRAM, NAND, logic and foundry, respectively?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","As a housekeeping response, we didn't disclose that before and I'm not going to kind of increment the disclosure today. Obviously, I think common knowledge at this point, the memory bias is first half, and the logic foundry is much closer to flattish, right? So you've got that as a kind of broad reference on WFE and that's where I would sit responding to the question, specifically. Maybe I could kind of provide some quality to statements as well that are helpful in response to the question.","The adjustments we've seen from customers in DRAM, I would say, have avoided overinvestments. That's a nice, simple way to kind of characterize it and we still believe from the analytics that we can form, it's still a tight marketplace. In NAND flash, the pace of the adjustments that we have seen have been moderating. They've been slowing, hence, the commentary that we're giving today around September and then expansion of the company again in December.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And then as a follow-up, just wanted again an update on what you're seeing in China. Obviously, the political landscape is unstable, to say the least. Don't know if that really impacts what your customers do in China but I'm just curious, your outlook on CapEx in China both for the back half of this year and more importantly, longer term, if that's changed at all.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I don't have the crystal ball, obviously, to kind of opine on the political dynamic and how various elements of this conversation play out. But our assumption today around the execution of our plans is the same as it always has been. We see legitimacy in the ambition and we see investments in capacity in China that are synchronized to the demand for units out of fabs and I would make that statement on a global basis and I would make it in regards to China as well.","Obviously, tariff-based conversations can and do impact the operations of companies like Lam and so left unattended, tariffs create incremental cost structures for us and we make the impact immaterial by modifying kind of our supply chain. We have to take actions to mitigate that risk and there's no material exposure embedded in our forecast for tariffs.","Relative to long-term China, if the environment of export control it is what it is today, the plans of customers will execute. If it changes, then we have to kind of revisit the assumptions at that point in time. We don't see evidence today of planned changes, so nothing to report. But I would say we're attentive to the very same things that you are and we can control only so much of this conversation. So \u2013 and we'll be on the same boat as everybody else if and when things change, I guess.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Pitzer at Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Martin, if you kind of look at your growth over the last several years, there's been multiple components to it, but market share gain has been a meaningful driver of your growth profile. I'm just kind of curious as you look towards the 9x layer NAND and then 1y, 1x, 1z in DRAM, how are you thinking about your share potential from here?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","It is kind of a shorter term message and a long-term message. The shorter one is we are in for a busy second half because the decisions of the second half, have a \u2013 I think a three times greater in the impact than the ones at the first half. So, the second half is a busy period for the company.","The objective of the company, I hope, is well understood. We are investing to increase our relevance to the success of the customers and gain market share in etch and deposition, in memory, and in logic foundry. And we've put together multiple years' worth of momentum that we intend to build upon. We don't win everything, we don't defend everything, but we've demonstrated over a multiple years that we win more than we don't and that's the objective kind of going forward.","The best reference still is the long-term models that we gave, that's the call out market share references. And the last thing I would say is when you think about the holistic growth opportunities of Lam, let's remember market share is $1 billion component of a $3 billion reference. So we're seeking $1 billion of SAM expansion, we're seeking $1 billion of growth from market share and we're seeking $1 billion of growth in the space of the installed base business of the company. So it's kind of one element of three and all are very important and all are being invested in.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's helpful, Martin. And then as you think about kind of the recovery into the December quarter, obviously, if your memory customers are more profitable of recovery becomes easier and so there is clearly a price element embedded in the recovery. But I'm just kind of curious to what extent could it be somewhat ASP independent on the memory side? It's just the timing of when these technology transitions your customers are working on begin to inflect again.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yes. I mean, I think the profitability levels and the revenue levels, it eliminates the limitations on investments, but I don't think profitability levels on their own drive investment. I think demand for chips and elasticity of demand from pricing and attachment rates drive demand for investment. So I think profits have taken off the table the limitations, but certain points in our history have limited investment so there's much more flexibility for our customers today than ever before. But I think our customers hold themselves accountable to investing capacity when they have chips to sell. And that's a great commentary on health of an industry.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Helpful. Thank you, guys.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, John.","Operator","And next, we have Atif Malik with Citi.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you for taking my question. Martin, historically, when we have seen a weakness over your memory customers, they have all happened at the same time or maybe one after another. What's different this time? I mean, you talked about not all customers are changing their plans and why should we believe others won't follow the leaders?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Well, I've tried to articulate again not just in memory, but broadly in the industry, how I think the industry is different today than it was through kind of 10 years ago. And one of the differences is that I see very significant customers in leadership positions with very clear segment and market focus that has some differences with very clear strategies and very clear opportunities and risks and limitations on strategies.","And our customers, and I'll use 3D NAND as a great example, there was a -- I think a four-year separation between the first adopter on 3D NAND technology to the last of the four. And that's illustrative of how their strategies are quite unique. And that's not a good or bad. It's just a statement of uniqueness optimized in their minds to the opportunities in the marketplace to be successful growing a business. So I think customers -- they are all attempting to pursue the right ambition, which is profitable market share, not just market share, and we have the same aspiration. But there is, for sure, a uniqueness of a device targeting in the marketplace, market segmentation. There's also uniqueness of clean room capacity, there is also uniqueness of investment coming online from a timing point of view. And there's uniqueness in terms of the installed base roadmaps of these companies. And so, all of that means, I believe, that the power of the customer is greater than the power of the segment when it comes to analyzing the direction of the industry.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And Doug, fairly aggressive share repurchase here, 60% through. Is there any consideration of annuity purchase program?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","At the end of the quarter, we were still only 60% on the way through. We need to get a little closer to the end before we'd start thinking about what's next after.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","But the framework, again, is pretty simple for answering that question, right? I mean, the priority is investing the profitable growth of the company and when we have cash that is excess to that need, return it to our shareholders. And we've operated with that philosophy for probably at least a decade, maybe more. And it's the guidance under any conditions going forward.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. We're obviously going to continue the program. We talked about that. I'll remind you the Analyst Day commentary about 50% of cash, but still how we're thinking about the framework.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Atif.","Operator","Then our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. If you go back to June quarter, when did you start seeing the weakness in orders or shipments? I guess it's more orders than shipments, and so shipment for the June quarter was above expectation. I'm just trying to reconcile the timing because your other competitors in the equipment space seems to be seeing that a little earlier than you did.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","I think you got two problems with the question and the answer I could give you. The first problem is none of us have any idea of the assumptions and the original disclosure of the companies that you're talking about, and so any reference is kind of hard to interpret. I'm not going to get into specifics on dates, but the changes are fairly recent.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Maybe a follow-up question is that related to ASC 606, I know you talked about the product side. But is there any impact on your service revenue as well? There are some multi-year service contracts and others like that?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","No. To a much lesser extent, service looks very similar; old rules, new rules.","Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Sidney.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered, so just one question for you, Doug. In terms of the installed base business that continues to grow for you guys, you've always talked about how it's very accretive to your operating margins. As that business grows, how do you balance the investments needed to continue to grow that business and I guess streamline those operations to have it continue to drop the bottom line?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I don't think I've ever said, Patrick. It's really accretive. It's maybe a little bit up the operating income line but it's not wildly different. And some of the things we're doing to try to drive growth in that business are the advanced services you hear us talk about, setting objectives around growing faster than the installed base, driving new programs to help solve some of the problems customers have inside of the fab in unique ways that we know how to do given our familiarity with our own equipment.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. And from an investment point of view, I mean, I wouldn't characterize that we run the installed base part of the company any differently than we do the systems piece. I mean, we do our best to anticipate and identify opportunities and risks. We do our best to invest timely and proactively to be successful, and we do our best to make sure that when there are changes in business levels, the cost structure of the company in the short-term is appropriately responsive without kind of compromising that long-term view. And so it's the same gig for every business unit and every element of the portfolio of the company.","Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","And our next question is from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Yes, good afternoon. To getting back to the memory side of the business, curious if there was any difference in your view of the bit growth for either the NAND or the DRAM market.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Not really. And no difference, frankly, from the view that's opined by most of the market participants. I mean, we've got an assumption of the low 20s for bit supply in DRAM and we've got an assumption of the low 40s for NAND. So I think that's kind of genuinely consistent with what folks are talking about.","From a transition point of view, maybe a little bit more to help you out. I mean, our assumption is that the kind of 1x, 1y investment levels in DRAM will represent somewhere around the 50% level, plus or minus kind of 5 points or 10 points by the end of the calendar year. And we're assuming by the end of the calendar year that the 3D capable parts of the NAND installed base is a little over the 1 million wafer stat per month level. And obviously, it exists in various forms. So 3D isn't all Generation 4 or Generation 5. It's the full portfolio but we're well on the way to making that the primary output technology of non-volatile memory.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, great. And then Doug, when you look at the margin in your guidance still remains fairly healthy, are there any one-time or mix benefits in the quarter or are those expected margins based on the revenue?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Nothing I'd specifically point to, Tom. And business goes up, it goes down a little bit. We do have fixed costs so that's probably a piece of what's going on. But there's also a product mix, a customer mix component. There's always a lot of things that move around quarter by quarter.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","And the best profitability metric for the company forward-looking is the long-term model again.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yes. That's right.","Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Tom.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","And next, from RBC Capital Markets, we'll hear from Mitch Steves.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one in terms of kind of a modeling question if I look out for fiscal year 2019 essentially. Just your margins have improved both on the gross margin and operating margin front of the last several years. Is there any reason that shouldn't continue or how do we think about by and large the operating margin profile for the next year or so?","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yes. Mitch, what I'd point you to is we put out in March an update to the long-term model, kind of looking at that, looking at revenue levels, looking at where we've been in recent history and correlating the two data points, I think, is the best guidance I can give you to answer the question.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Mitch.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I actually have a question around foundry. If I look at the numbers, it's been down quite a bit in fiscal 2018 versus 2017. I think we have heard it from other people so I'm not surprised that it's down. But just curious in the context of the September guidance, it's down mostly or not all in memory. Do you actually expect your foundry revenue to continue to grow sequentially? Or how do you think about that in 3Q or in the calendar second half of the year?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Well, I mean, from a marketplace point of view as I mentioned a few moments ago, there's much more stability at WFE and foundry logic combined first half and second half than is true in memory. And the specific purchasing decision timings for etch and deposition are, I think, kind of well understood at this point in time. They're a little later in the flow because of shorter lead times perhaps than the lithography investments at this point in time. And we have objectives to gain share obviously from 10 to 7 and in turn to 5.","And this year is largely a year of 7 nanometer build-outs and 5 pilots with, as you I think well understand, a pretty broad set of participation at the 28 nanometer level. And we don't have any new headlines today on the EUV. It's exactly the same as it was when we spoke in our Analyst Meeting. So it's a nice opportunity for the company, it continues to be a big focus and yeah, that's, I guess, the best I can share.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Actually, that's very helpful. And then Doug, just on the guidance. If I \u2013 my background math tells me your OpEx is down around 10% on the September quarter. Is that all just from call it the leverage or the model or is there any call it programs that you might be delaying that may come back in December? We just wanted to understand how we think about that.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","What I'd tell you relative to R&D programs is nothing is delayed. Everything is going forward at the same pace that it always has been. We're not \u2013 if there's a near-term move around in the business, we're not messing around with any of that. I think I talked maybe a year or so ago about you are going to see more variability quarter-to-quarter in our spend modulated by profit levels.","Our variable compensation varies with the level of profit of the business. And so as profitably varies, spending varies along with it. And as we look at a softening in business for the quarter, we're very aggressively managing discretionary-type spending, things like travel and entertainment and whatnot just to be responsive to the level of the business. So it's a combination of all of those things.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","But I appreciate you asking the question and recognizing the efforts of the company that respond to balancing short-term and long-term because it's really hard to do. It takes a lot of time and effort to create the guidance that you've just spoken to. So thank you for recognizing it.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","No, thanks for answering my question. That's all I have.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","And next, we'll take a question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Weston David Twigg - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to take a stab at -- C.J. at the beginning had asked your views on 2019 demand. And I don't need a number, but I'm just wondering at this point, do you think you could be -- see a similar level of overall with WFE next year? Or up or down, do you have a directional indication based on your conversations with customers?","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I think there's a number of kind of industry participant statements in the marketplace today of equivalency are slightly up. I've seen being kind of the $100 billion references over a couple of years. And I don't have a basis to kind of disagree with those.","To more specifically speak to something of substance from Lam, I would say as well as having the expectation that December is higher than September, our expectation is that the first half of next year is a stronger half than the second half of this year. And the order of magnitude, we'll speak to over time.","But we feel really good about the health of the industry as I've tried to speak to. We feel kind of really good about the value propositions that our customers are seeking, the discipline throughout the ecosystem, and the opportunity for the company. And so while at some level it all feels like a pretty kind of negative moment in the history of our industry when we get these episodes, it's really good because it's a commentary on timeliness of response and discipline and health. And what should not get lost in this conversation is the fact that if you didn't believe us and you just thought that December EPS would be the same as the September EPS, we have growth in non-GAAP earnings of like 20% year-over-year.","And in most of the companies I've ever had an experience of working with, that's not such a bad number, right? So and adjustments exists in the context of some pretty nice growth for the industry and for the company and obviously, for our customers, that's even more true. So we feel pretty good.","Weston David Twigg - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I think I heard you definitely say weakness in memory in Q3 or in September. But, Martin, I think I heard you say it was more of a DRAM shift. And then I thought I heard Doug say there was more trimming in NAND. And I was just wondering if you could clarify what's the bigger driver of the downtick in September and that helps us understand the rebound a little bit better, I think.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Yeah. So I was kind of conscious of that potential risk as well as I listened to it. So what Doug was speaking to was kind of like the absolute kind of dollars comparison between the output of the company in the June quarter as compared to September and he's right to say the biggest change there is NAND. What I was speaking to was the prominence of the adjustments in the last kind of month or so. And DRAM was the biggest adjustments in the next month or so, so that's how you reconcile the two statements.","Weston David Twigg - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Helpful. Thank you.","Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.","Thank you much.","Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.","Thanks, Wes.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to our speakers for closing comments.","Odette Marie Go - Lam Research Corp.","That concludes our call. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining, and have a good afternoon.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining."]}}
