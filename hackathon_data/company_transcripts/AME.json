Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another spectacular quarter, as our businesses delivered exceptional results across all key operating and financial metrics. In the quarter, double-digit sales growth was driven by another excellent quarter of organic growth. We delivered significant operating margin expansion and robust earnings growth, while again increasing our full-year earnings guidance.","We generated a record level of free cash flow and announced that we deployed $565 million on two highly strategic acquisitions. And lastly, given the strength of our acquisition pipeline, we announced an increase on our revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion, providing us added flexibility as we execute on our acquisition strategy. So overall, another outstanding quarter, reflecting the strength of the AMETEK business model, the differentiated nature of our businesses, and the excellent work of the entire AMETEK team.","Now, on to the financial and business highlights. Total sales in the third quarter were $1.19 billion, up 10% compared to the third quarter of 2017. Organic sales growth was again very strong at 7%, with acquisitions adding 3% and foreign currency neutral to sales in the quarter.","Growth remains broad-based across our businesses, with both our reportable segments growing 7% organically. This organic growth also remains very strong and balanced geographically, with Asia growing 12%, Europe 7%, and the U.S. 6% in the quarter.","EBITDA in the third quarter was $312 million, up 14% over the third quarter of 2017, with EBITDA margins a very strong 26.1%. Third quarter operating income was $265.3 million, up 15% over the prior year. Reported operating income margins were up 100 basis points to 22.2%. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, operating margins increased by 130 basis points over the third quarter of last year. Third quarter earnings were $0.82 per diluted share, an increase of 24% over the same period last year, exceeding our guidance of $0.76 to $0.78 per share.","Now, turning to the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG had a great quarter, with strong growth and exceptional operating performance. Overall sales for EIG in the third quarter were $742 million, up 10% over the same quarter of 2017. Organic sales were up 7%, with recent acquisitions contributing 4%. Foreign currency was a slight headwind to sales in the quarter.","Organic growth remains broad-based across our EIG businesses. We saw very strong growth across our process businesses, including Rauland, which has experienced tremendous growth since being acquired in early 2017. Additionally, our Ultra Precision Technologies division had another outstanding quarter, with mid-teens organic sales growth.","Operating income for EIG in the quarter was $190.3 million, up 17% over the prior year period. Reported operating income margins were excellent at 25.6%, up a very strong 130 basis points over last year's third quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG margins were up an outstanding 190 basis points over the same quarter of 2017.","The Electromechanical Group also had an excellent quarter, with impressive sales growth and margin expansion. EMG sales in the third quarter were $450.9 million, a 9% increase over the same quarter last year. Organic sales growth was very strong, up 7% versus the prior year. The acquisition of FMH Aerospace contributed an additional 2% and foreign currency had no impact on sales. Sales growth remains strong and balanced across each of our key EMG businesses, including automation, aerospace and defense, and engineered materials.","EMG's operating income in the third quarter was $92.7 million, up 11% compared to the same quarter in 2017. And operating margins expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year to 20.6%. So, overall, a tremendous performance for AMETEK in the third quarter.","Now, let me provide some brief comments on tariffs. On last quarter's conference call, I highlighted the various work streams we were driving to help manage the tariff situation. Our teams are doing a tremendous job managing each of these initiatives and each is progressing as expected.","We remain very confident in our ability to mitigate headwinds from announced tariffs, given: number one, our ability to capture incremental pricing due to the highly differentiated nature of our business; number two, the strength and flexibility of our global supply chain; and number three, our ability to shift production given our asset-light business model. AMETEK's proven Operational Excellence capabilities, which captures each of these elements, positions us extremely well to offset the impact from tariffs.","More broadly, our Operational Excellence initiatives continued to deliver meaningful productivity and efficiency savings. For all of 2018, we now expect total savings of approximately $90 million from our OPEX initiatives. Our business model also remains focused on generating sustainable, long-term success by investing in our people, investing in our businesses, and investing our strong cash flows in strategic acquisitions.","With that said, I would like to take a minute to welcome two new businesses to AMETEK: Telular and Forza. Telular is a high-growth, market-leading provider of communication solutions for logistics management, tank monitoring and security applications. Telular's end-to-end IoT solutions include purpose-built hardware, proprietary software and wireless connectivity services. Their IoT solutions are used to enhance efficiency, lower cost and monitor critical assets in real-time, providing a significant return on investment for their customers.","Telular has annual sales of approximately $165 million, with 65% of sales from recurring, subscription-based sales. Their sales are expected to continue to grow at a roughly 10% annual rate, as adoption of Telular's IoT based communication solutions are still in the early stages.","In addition to the strength of the Telular business, we see tremendous value in leveraging their IoT capabilities across other AMETEK businesses. Our highly differentiated measurement instrumentation and domain expertise in our niche markets combined with Telular's IoT platform forms the core of an expanded digital strategy for AMETEK and opens up attractive growth opportunities for our businesses.","We expect to leverage this platform across other AMETEK businesses where we currently collect, measure and analyze important process variables across mission-critical applications. Telular is headquartered in Chicago, with multiple sales and support locations across the U.S. We deployed approximately $525 million on this acquisition.","Now, shifting to Forza. Forza designs and produces specialized solutions for complex image sensors used in medical, defense, commercial and industrial applications. Forza's deep expertise in CMOS imaging technology, combined with their proven design processes, in-house testing capability and supply chain expertise provide the end-to-end ability to design and produce customized next-generation sensor solutions for their customers.","One of these customers is our Vision Research business, a market leader in the ultra-high speed cameras for use in scientific research, medical, industrial and military applications. Forza provides Vision Research with custom sensor design and production capability which will accelerate the pace of new sensor development for use on our high-speed cameras. The company has annual sales of approximately $20 million and we deployed approximately $40 million on this acquisition.","Including Telular and Forza, we have now acquired five businesses thus far in 2018 and have deployed more than $935 million in capital and acquired approximately $300 million in sales. This is a record level of capital deployment for AMETEK in a year. Even with the strong acquisition activity this year, we're managing a robust pipeline of additional opportunities and have the balance sheet capacity and management bandwidth to remain very active.","Our businesses are also doing a tremendous job delivering exciting new products while expanding their presence globally and into new market segments. We're seeing tangible results from this organic growth initiative.","Our Ultra Precision Technology (sic) [Ultra Precision Technologies] (00:12:31) division is a good example of this success, as they delivered another quarter of mid-teens organic sales growth. The Ultra Precision Technologies division includes ZYGO, Reichert, Creaform, TMC, Precitech, Solartron, and Taylor Hobson, a highly differentiated group of businesses which provide leading-edge ultra-precise metrology solutions and precision optical products for a diverse set of attractive end markets and applications. With these businesses, developing new technology is key to maintaining their market-leading product and application differentiation, while providing the ability to expand into new market segments.","Our Taylor Hobson business, a leader in ultra-precision measurement instruments for a wide range of end markets including optics, aerospace and precision manufacturing, recently launched its PGI NOVUS system. The new system is powered by Metrology 4.0 software and it's the most advanced system available for surface, contour, 3D and diameter measurement. Through this development, Taylor Hobson has addressed many measurement challenges commonly faced by high precision component manufacturers.","The new Metrology 4.0 software package delivers a simple intuitive interface with a virtual display and real-time control, enabling a level of monitoring and control that is unprecedented in the industry. Developing new products and solutions like the PGI NOVUS are key in driving sustained organic growth and our businesses are doing a great job on this front.","In the third quarter, our vitality index, which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions introduced within the last three years, was 23%. This reflects a tremendous effort of our more than 1,900 engineers around the globe that are designing and implementing new products and solutions for our customers.","Now, onto the outlook for the remainder of the year. Given our outstanding results through the first three quarters of the year and our positive outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect earnings to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.27 per diluted share, an increase of 25% over 2017's adjusted earnings per diluted share. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $3.16 to $3.20. We expect overall sales to be up low-double digits, with organic sales now up mid to high-single digits for all of 2018.","For the fourth quarter, overall sales are to be up approximately 10%, with organic sales up mid-single digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.84, up 17% to 20% over the same quarter last year.","I'm very pleased with the outstanding results that our world-class teams have produced thus far in 2018. AMETEK is firmly positioned to close the year with record results. We are focused on continuing this year's success into the future by executing our four growth strategies.","I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then, we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an outstanding third quarter with a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial details.","In the third quarter, selling expenses were 10.6% of sales versus 10.7% in last year's third quarter, with core selling expenses up in line with core sales growth. General and administrative expenses in the third quarter were up $1.7 million over the prior year due to higher compensation costs. And as a percentage of sales, G&A expenses were 1.5%, in line with last year's level.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.9% versus last year's rate of 24.9% and was in line with our expectations. The year-over-year reduction in our effective tax rate was due to the benefits of tax reform. We expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full-year estimated rate.","Working capital was very solid at 18.2% of sales in the third quarter, up slightly from 17.9% a year ago. Capital expenditures were $19 million for the quarter. We continue to expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $85 million or 1.8% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $48 million. For the full-year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $205 million.","Third quarter operating cash flow was $249 million and free cash flow was a record $230 million, a very solid conversion of 120% of net income. We continue to expect full-year free cash flow conversion of approximately 110% of net income.","The primary use of our strong free cash flow was to support our acquisition strategy. And as Dave mentioned, we've been very active on that front. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we deployed approximately $565 million on the acquisitions of Telular and Forza. These acquisitions bring our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2018 to approximately $935 million.","Total debt at September 30 was $1.9 billion, down from $2.17 billion at the end of 2017, as we paid off two maturing senior notes in the quarter totaling $240 million. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $519 million.","Even with our record level of capital deployment, including the acquisitions of Telular and Forza, we still have significant capacity with approximately $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.","This includes the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended and upsized revolving credit facility we announced today. This amended facility increases the size of our revolving credit facility from $850 million to $1.5 billion and extends the maturity date to October of 2023. This provides us with additional capacity and flexibility to support our acquisition strategy.","In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the third quarter, which allowed us to deliver high-quality earnings growth and again raise our full-year guidance. We remain well-positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. Andrew, could we please open the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D. A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you. A couple of questions. First, even into the month of October, Dave, have you seen any signs of slowing in your business and semiconductor in China? And then, would you be willing to provide at this point any high-level thoughts in terms of how you're thinking about 2019?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. The first question, October finished right on plan. It was a very strong orders month. It exceeded our expectations in fact a bit and so we're very, very happy with that. We just got the numbers this morning.","In terms of the semiconductor market, it's about 5% of AMETEK and it's performing very well. And we have some very specialized capability and we are selling to the Chinese semiconductor market, but we have seen no slowdown in that regard and we're expecting that to continue.","And regarding 2019, I'm really not in a position to speak to the specifics about 2019 at this point in time. We'll be meeting with our businesses during November and December to hear from each of them. As you know, we operate in a variety of niche markets and we need to understand what is going on in each of these businesses to have a bottoms-up view from our budgeting process before giving any guidance.","Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.","And then as my follow-up, Dave, can you talk about what realized price was in Q3 and what the spread between price versus cost was for you guys? Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure, Matt. Sure. We had an excellent quarter in terms of price. In Q3, we achieved price of about 2.2% across our entire portfolio. And total inflation have picked up a bit. It was about 1.4%. And we saw positive spread of about 80 basis points. So we're very pleased with these results. The results speak to the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio, our leadership position in niche markets and our focus and determination to make sure we stay in front of a changing global economic environment with pricing outpacing inflation.","Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you, David.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, and congrats on a continued excellent year.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Chris.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Curious about Telular versus the other two communication solutions deals. Almost seems like it maybe discreetly different space. So, wondering if it does gel with those other deals. And then also update Dave Zapico vision of adjacencies, maybe communication solutions strikes me, wouldn't have fallen in the range of the AME concept of adjacencies in the not-too-distant past.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question, Chris. I mean, when we look at Telular, we see a business that checks a lot of boxes for us. It's a market leader in niche markets. It's a differentiated technology solutions business. It has very good secular growth, growing about 10% a year the last three years. It has a sizable recurring revenue stream. That's a bit new. It's very profitable, mid-20s EBITDA, with room for margin expansion. So we see very good cost synergy opportunities.","We also see opportunities to expand the business internationally. They've had so much growth that they've just concentrated on the U.S., and we have the capability to help them expand internationally. But aside from the Telular, Telular is a good business in its own right. It also provides something else to AMETEK. It enables a broad set of AMETEK businesses to deliver IoT solutions when combined \u2013 when you combine AMETEK's sensor technology with Telular's IoT capability, it really creates a new growth avenue for all of our businesses. So we're very excited about them.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital. Your line is now open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Wanted to ask you about the orders in the quarter organically by segment.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Okay. The total reported orders were up 6%. The organic orders were up 5% and both groups were up mid-single digits.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got you. Also, I see that the operating excellence number went up to $90-plus million.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Could you talk a little bit about operating excellence more broadly, particularly not just how you got there, which I assume includes some hurrying of things on the tariffs side, but also how operating excellence being it's now stretched over the sales functions, how that is adding to sales?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. The first point is, as you know, we had a $85 million target for total cost savings working through the P&L and we increased it to $90 million in my prepared remarks. And that's really about $70 million is going to come from our supply chain and about $20 million from other Operational Excellence initiatives and really are continuing doing a great job and they're handling that work along with the tariffs and it really speaks to the capability of our teams.","Regarding the expansion of the commercial excellence initiatives that we've been working on for some time, now we're seeing really good traction. I mean, Bill and I are going around and visiting the businesses and seeing the attributes of growth kaizen, the focus on the aftermarket, improved digital marketing. It's a big part of our leadership development now. We just finished our leadership development processes and making sure that we're doing the proper things to develop our sales and marketing talent. So, it's really a comprehensive approach to improving the organic growth of the businesses. It's going extremely well and we're still in the early innings of that. So we're very positive of what's going on.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So one of the things that \u2013 I'd just tuck this in very quickly on that because I know how important this is internally. One of the things that a couple of your competitors do is to really kind of train salespeople to more efficiently generate leads as well as shrinking the time to create an order out of that, giving them a critical path, and then delivering on that order, obviously, on time full spec, the whole thing. Could you just sort of tuck in how AMETEK beyond the four things you just mentioned is addressing sort of let's say the front end of sales lead process?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I think the lead process would be \u2013 all of our businesses are out there with their sales forces generating leads. And what we've done is we've really enhanced our digital marketing lead capability, so we'll take all of our leads and we'll make sure that we'll generate more leads. We'll make sure that they're properly dispositioned. We'll follow up on them to make sure that we're getting good return on our advertising dollars or the way that we're marketing our products. So lead generation and lead follow-up is a big part of that \u2013 big part of the program we have to accelerate internal growth. So it's a core component of what I'd say, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's great. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities","Hey guys, good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Allison.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities","Just want to go back to Telular. I know you gave a mix of new versus recurring revenue, not sure if you touched on this, but the hardware versus software component, how should we think about that?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. The Telular solution provides \u2013 it requires both hardware and software. So you have a situation where you're providing hardware and also software and connectivity are provided to the service, and there's an annual subscription. So I would say it's not a classic SaaS business, but it has elements of the SaaS business, and the software and the algorithms and the analytics with the software are linked with the hardware.","So it's a good fit for AMETEK because, as you know, the hardware part of the world is what we're really good at. And with all of our sensors and instrumentation businesses, that's what we're doing out there all the time. And adding the IoT capability to those businesses is something we're very excited about. Also, Telular, they have a best-of-breed IoT solution, but with sensor technologies, they were struggling to a certain degree and that's really our expertise. So the combination of both businesses is a wonderful strategic fit.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities","Great. And then you'd also touched on Asia growing nicely. Any noted changes in China over the past few, I guess, weak season, where are your successes over there, any issues on the other side? I know you talked about (00:30:30).","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. No, that's a great question, Allison. I mean, the China was \u2013 it grew nicely for us in the quarter. It drove the overall sales growth of Asia. It was a bit higher than the overall Asia sales growth. And the tariff situation related to the demand side which China adds complexity that we're watching closely. So far there's no impact, but we'll continue to monitor it closely and our teams over there are bullish.","And really, if you think about it and you take a step back and operate at maybe 30,000 feet, we have the capability that lets China improve their manufacturing capability, to move up the value chain. That's what our process businesses do and those businesses are doing very well in China. So, we're not seeing a slowdown right now, but we're watching it closely.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks. That's helpful.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Just a follow-up on Allison's last question there, could you calibrate and update us on what you think the tariff impact is? Last quarter, you said less than $0.01 for the third and fourth quarter. Where does that stand today?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. Yeah, yeah. In Q3, the situation played out a little better than we expected. We had a little less than $0.01 from direct impact from tariffs, and we offset that with price. So we got ahead of it. We expect a similar situation to play out in Q4. We'll have a little bit higher direct impact. It'll be about $0.01 from the tariffs, but we feel we largely have it covered with our initiatives and we're effectively managing through it.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. That's nice work on price cost as well. And Dave, you gave an interesting data point last quarter, and this has been the raging debate in the sector as to where we are in the cycle and there's a lot of market sentiments thinking we're at peak cycle, but you were pretty adamant last quarter citing fourth inning. And I know the Red Sox have wrapped up another World Series and so maybe we'll stay with your baseball analogy.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Okay.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Do you dare talk about another \u2013 where we are in terms of innings as you see it today?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","I think it's the bottom of the fourth and the home team's up. I mean, we came out of the recession strong. We see no slowdown in our business so \u2013 and it looks really optimistic. So it still feels good to us.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's certainly coming through in your orders in October. So we'll leave it there. And then, just the last question is, an idea that's come up a number of times, investors have asked us is, when would you all consider moving to cash EPS? It strikes us as a number of just most of your growth by acquisition peers have all similarly switched, whether it's Danaher, Fortive, Dover, Roper. And again, we know it doesn't change any of the fundamentals, but certainly optically it puts you on a level playing field in this peer group and is this something that you all would consider?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes. We would consider it, Deane. We considered it last year, and we decided not to do it. And we also talked to additional investors through the course of this year. So we'll evaluate it and we'll decide what we're going to do at year-end. That would probably be a good time, and we'll let you know what we're going to do.","Last year, we decided not to do it, because there are varying opinions of investors and our long-term investors matter a lot to us, and we're a GAAP company and we're proud of that. We have very little adjustments to our financial statements, but we also hear what investors are saying on the cash EPS. So we're evaluating it and we'll make a decision at year-end to do it or not do it like we did last year.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And just it's clear from our perspective that we think it would be a good idea, but we appreciate all the color. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you. Your input is noted.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning, all.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Morning, Brett.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Morning, Brett.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just want to come back to the M&A pipeline. I guess as you think about the types of deals you're looking at, is this software-based type deal that you're announcing today more opportunistic, or are you seeing a tilt of the pipeline towards deals with more software or recurring elements, and maybe just a finer point on the size of deals you're evaluating?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Software, AMETEK's always been excellent at software within our niche businesses. And we have a tremendous capability and a lot of proprietary software as to the value proposition, we deliver for our customers. And we've talked in prior calls about our center in India with about now close to 150 software engineers developing software for all of our businesses.","And with some of the trends going on in the market, we've been looking for quite some time for an IoT type business. And we saw companies that were either very good at sensors who developed an IoT capability or companies that were very good at IoT capabilities that weren't good at sensors.","And since we were good at sensors and we wanted the capability, we think we found a great fit in Telular. And I think that it's a secular business and software is going to become more important as we move forward within AMETEK's portfolio. That's a fact. But we're still looking in all the ponds that we've been fishing for in the past. And we're not a wholesale changing the direction; we found just a great business that we could get a good return on the business itself and the unique situation and it adds capability to many of the AMETEK businesses. So we're looking forward to getting to work on that.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Did you have another question, Brett?","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Just one more follow-up and then \u2013 just in terms of the value chain, I mean obviously AMETEK plays a few links up in a lot of the served markets. But any sense of pre-buying, buy the value chain or parts of the chain ahead of price increases? And maybe just a little more color on the state of inventories relative to production schedules there.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah, we may not be the best company to get that input from because we're building largely customized products. So there isn't a lot of buy ahead in terms of our products because they're purpose-built to the customer requirements. So we don't see a lot of that typically in our businesses. And in the places that we could see that, we're not seeing it right now. So, it's a healthy environment. Customers have money. Customers are putting it to work and they're keeping up with their demand, is the way that we're looking at it.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. I'll pass it along. Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just first question in terms of all the deals that you've done this year, could you help us with the math how accretive it is to 2019 numbers?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. The first year we do a deal, there's a lot of restructuring, there's a lot of purchase accounting and they usually don't add that much to the capability \u2013 the earnings in the next year. I would point you \u2013 at this point, we haven't completed our work for 2019, but I could see a similar level of accretion that we had last year. And I think we've pointed everyone to a $0.06-type number, and I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't end up like something like that. But a company like Telular is going to add something more later in the year because of all the acquisition step-ups and the purchase accounting required and the plans we have for the business.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. And another question, we get a lot of questions about your aerospace and defense and energy exposure. Could you remind us \u2013 could you just talk a little bit more about each one and what are you seeing in both markets in terms of growth this year, backlog and outlook, because it seems there's a lot of sort of operating and cyclical leverage there? Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Our aerospace \u2013 our overall aerospace business was up mid-teens in the third quarter. And it was driven by contributions from the recently acquired FMH Aerospace and high-single digit organic sales growth in the aerospace group. We saw solid and balanced growth across our various aerospace markets, with notable strength on our commercial and military businesses.","You may recall that AMETEK's about 35% military, about 25% commercial, about 30% third-party MRO and about 10% business jet. So with commercial and military markets doing well, that's good for us. And for all of 2018, we continue to expect organic sales for our aerospace business to be up mid-single digits, with growth across each segment. So we're feeling really good about our aerospace business.","In recent years, we won a lot of content on Airbus airframes in the commercial world, and now with the military market coming back to life and a solid spending environment both the U.S. and international for military, its general spending to improve fleet readiness, but we've also had major design wins on the F-35 and a lot of important programs. And we're not dependent on any one program, but the military market is really changed from what it was a couple of years ago and we're doing very well with it.","In terms of oil and gas, you mentioned that also, oil and gas now is about 6% of AMETEK. In Q3, it was up mid-single digit. And for the full year, we expect sales to be up mid to high-single digits, with the upstream up low-double digits and the mid and downstream up low to mid-single digits. And at $65 oil, we see solid business activity. The international components of it are picking up. We're about one-third U.S., two-thirds international; about 25% upstream, 75% mid and downstream. So the business feels solid. We see it just slowly incrementally getting stronger and we feel positive about the exposure.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just on energy, just a follow-up, how far off the peak are we now?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. We were \u2013 at peak, we were about $400 million, and now we're at about $280 million. So we're still roughly $120 million from the peak.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thank you so much.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","So just want to kind of weigh in on this cash EPS debate. I mean, GAAP \u2013 obviously GAAP earnings is the gold standard. But I think you mentioned $205 million amortization this year. I think that looks more like $220 million, $230 million next year. It's becoming a really big number. I mean, I think that number was about $145 million of D&A in 2015. So, I think, as you do these larger deals and (00:43:01) deals, it's becoming a much more disconnected number from economic reality. So, for what it's worth, we fully support a move to cash EPS, but just wanted to make that very clear.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Okay.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Good. Anyway, so first question on China, you got a pretty broad footprint in China, quite a large proportion of your sales. What are you seeing in China? It doesn't sound like there's any slowdown that you've seen in 3Q, but any areas of concern? You mentioned \u2013 you called out semi as remaining very strong to you, but any areas of concern in China.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. The concern is really what's going to happen with the overall trade situation. Obviously, people in China are nervous about this situation, but the business activity at least for our businesses are still continuing very strongly. We're selling into that market with products that the Chinese economy needs. And in the semiconductor market, in the nuclear instrumentation market, in the advanced process market, we're helping improve their production efficiencies. So we're definitely seeing a positive market and we're doing well over there, but it's just the overall global overhang that adds the complexity and we're watching it closely, but we haven't seen an impact so far in demand.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then going back to Telular, there's been a lot of questions on it so far. If I missed it I'm sorry, but what are the margins, EBITDA margins for that business?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. They were mid-20% EBITDA margins.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Mid-20% EBITDA, okay. And the growth profile and just one final question on that would be, I think the background of this business was in the residential and commercial electronic security markets, but it's branched into industrial. How does that mix look today?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. The residential part of Telular is about 20% of the business. So what they did is, the foundation of the business many years ago was mainly in the commercial and residential market and that business has been a strong cash flow generator, and they found a nice niche to operate in, but they've grown the industrial market around it.","So the non-residential piece is about 80%. The residential piece is about 20%. And there also is a growth driver in that \u2013 the non-industrial piece is to grow through the \u2013 there's a UL Standard, that's an approved standard for wireless sole path fire alarm monitoring and that business is going well. And that business sells to 5,000 dealers and it's a very good business. They're agnostic to any other brands and they have carved out a nice little niche that results in a solid recurring revenue stream.","So really we'll have the same strategy that Telular had is using that business to generate very strong cash flow with strong sticky customer relationships and growing the industrial piece of Telular aggressively. And that's the same model that Telular brings to AMETEK. It's just a well thought out model.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you. And then just one final one, does your guidance anticipate any 4Q restructuring?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Not that we know of at this time. I mean, certainly there's some \u2013 the Tax Reform and Job Acts (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] (00:46:18) gives you till the year-end to finalize the accounting related to tax reform. So we'll be looking at that. And there are no current plans for realignment, but certainly we're going to be going through our budgeting process next two months. And if there are good projects that our businesses want to do, then we could be in a situation, but we don't have anything planned at this time.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thanks, David.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sawyer Rice with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'll let go the sentiments on cash EPS there, but maybe to dig a little deeper on some of the tariffs. Looks like you guys have done a good job so far in managing that. Maybe any early thoughts here on 2019, maybe how much of your supply chain do you see as tariffed at this point? And then can you maybe update us if we do see List 3 jumping to 25%, what the impact here could be for 2019? Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. It's a dynamic situation, Sawyer. I mean, we're working on a number of initiatives. We've been very successful in Q3. We expect a similar situation in Q4. We're assuming in our budget model it's going to go from 10% to 25% in List 3. And we're also putting plans in place so that we understand the List 4 impact, but it's very dynamic and we're effectively managing through it. And I'm confident that's going to continue because of the things that I talked about in my prepared remarks. We really have pricing leverage to deal with tariffs because of the unique differentiated nature of our portfolio. We have an excellent supply chain capability around the world that are executing very well right now.","And finally, if we get in a situation where we want to move our product line and we have a couple of product lines that we're in the process of moving, we have an asset-light business model where we don't have a lot of stranded fixed investments. We can move products to other low-cost regions around the world. So I feel very comfortable that we're going to be able to manage through this. 2019 is a very dynamic situation and I don't want to give any information related to that yet. But we'll find that out during our process, during November and December.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the additional color there and congrats on the quarter.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Sawyer.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is now open.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, good morning. Dave, could you provide maybe an update on the EMIP business, just curious how that's acting from a demand standpoint? And then also is there anything from a metals perspective, prices have been up, they seem to be stabilizing, that's moving the margins around in there. Is there any concern around the margin line and maybe just what the demand is for the EMIP business?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. There is an element of the EMIP business where we pass on the cost of the metals business and that's working in the P&L. But as you saw, we had the 50 basis points improvement in core margins. So even with that, we're able to grow margins. The EMIP demand is very strong. I mean, we're up a bit more than EMG in the third quarter. So we're up 7% at EMG. We're up a bit more at EMIP. And our customers are optimistic. We're seeing strong demand in aerospace, medical and specialized industrial.","As you mentioned, there are some inflationary impacts in metals, and \u2013 but we're dealing with that. And I think, in the case of oil and gas, there was \u2013 we still had not recovered to our peak. I believe in the case of the metals business, we're not at our peak yet, but we're much closer. So we had \u2013 I think at the trough, that was down maybe $125 million, and I think now we're within $20 million of our peak. So total metals are about $480 million and the peak was $500 million. So we're getting back to that, but still have some room to go and the demand is strong.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. And then just \u2013 I just want to double back for a second to the aerospace business in general. Given the long cycle nature of that business, can you just kind of characterize \u2013 I know we don't want to touch 2019 here in terms of growth rate, but one would assume that maybe that business in 2019 tracks at least at 2018's growth rate with backlog and kind of demand on the military side and commercial backlogs. Is that a fair way to look at that business that you've got pretty good visibility there from the backlog and the demand into 2019? Is it best guess to be mid-single digits?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I think when you take a step back and commercial market is about 25% of our aerospace exposure, and we're on the right aircraft and the business is performing very well. And about half of that business is proprietary aftermarket. So that commercial business looks good for the foreseeable future.","I mean, the big change is the military business. We're on most military aircraft. We both have a domestic and an international component. The military business is, as I said before, it's picking up and it's strong. The business jet market was kind of down for a long period of time. The orders seem to be picking up there. So I think it's green lights for the aerospace business for AMETEK, I would say, for the foreseeable future.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just two last questions. Around Europe, could you remind us what \u2013 when you look at AMETEK's business and you look at EMEA, is the business slanted towards or weighted towards EIG or EMG in EMEA?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, it's really balanced. I mean the big thing you have for EMG, you have our Dunkermotoren business and that's a big, big component of EMG. In the quarter, we saw our strongest growth in the automation in the Dunkermotoren PMC business, and we also saw strong growth in EIG with our Materials Analysis business doing very well.","So in Europe, it's kind of like as a microcosm of AMETEK in the whole world. We have some major instrument businesses in the UK, in Germany and in France, and we have substantial manufacturing presences in those regions, and we also have a substantial business and operating capability with our Dunkermotoren businesses for EMG in Germany. So it's really about the same proportions of the whole company.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just my last quick question, regarding Telular, do they have any OE sales? What is that \u2013 how do they get to market?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, they have a direct-to-market with customers and they sell to a variety of end markets in the...","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Do they sell to any other OE, like automation vendors?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","No. In the \u2013 no, they're selling their solutions directly to end customers. They're getting long-term contracts from end customers. They're managing...","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","...both the hardware, the communication services and the software. Now, on the business that goes after commercial and residential security that I talked about, the 20% residential, that's a different channel, and that goes to about a network of 5,000 dealers. And those are smaller, regional, independent companies. So, there's kind of two different channels depending on the two different businesses.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And presumably given the channels and that mix, that 20-80 mix, in that 10% kind of CAGR sales expectation, there's pricing there as well, you have pretty good pricing flexibility there as well?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. It's the same as any AMETEK business I'd say. Yeah.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Morning, Joe.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","I guess as a former CPA, I give condolences to the death of GAAP here, but (00:55:07). Yeah, I think you guys have been pushed pretty hard on \u2013 is there a negative inflection anywhere in your business and you've been pretty consistent with your answers. But Dave, can you talk about what are the things that you kind of look at to gauge those inflections? Like, where are the most sensitive businesses that you would kind of look for, because others are seeing something and you guys are still seeing kind of accelerating, and at least stable growth. So where are you? And what would you start doing if those businesses started to shift a little bit? What would be your first couple actions to take?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Well, yeah, I mean, AMETEK is known for our Operational Excellence capabilities. So if we saw a downturn, we would not shy away from getting in front of it and managing the costs aggressively. So that would be what we would do. In terms of \u2013 we're mainly a group of mid and long cycle businesses and we don't see that right now. But certainly, if there was a canary in the coal mine in our business that used to be our cost-driven motors business, but now that's a small, very small fraction of what it was and the demand in that business is still holding up very well. So we don't see demand turning negative right now. But if it does, that's what AMETEK's good at. We manage costs, we get in front of it and we have a team of seasoned operators that realize that.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then as far as M&A, this seems interesting with acquiring a company with an IoT solution that was a little bit weak with sensors where you guys can come in. But with your core being on metrology, where do you consider like a bridge too far? Like, when do you start straying from what you guys are really good at and getting into other things that are more recurring because they might be good financial decision?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. Yeah, I think about it in terms of the adjacency road maps that we build for each of our businesses. And those are adjacency road maps that will look in near adjacencies and I consider this business to be that. So close adjacencies are always the ones that you know best and the ones you have the least risk with and we're cognizant of that. So I don't think we'll be buying businesses that we have no knowledge of or affiliation with. But certainly, there's an expanded group of opportunities and the opportunity set's expanded. And we have a broad set of niche businesses that we have adjacency maps for.","So I think you'll see more of the same. We're doing businesses. Some of the deals that we've done recently have been more secular. Some of the deals that we've done more recently have been more technology-oriented. We're also doing a lot of tuck-ins that enhance our market positions. And we have a really good pipeline right now. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we have a strong balance sheet and we're actively looking at some properties right now.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then just last from me quick, can you maybe touch on the few businesses that we haven't discussed yet? I think...","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, sure.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","...maybe power and industrial overall and process as an overall?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I'll go through \u2013 we covered aerospace already (58:16) process. Our process businesses had a very strong quarter. Overall sales were up low-double digits, driven by high-single digit organic sales growth and contributions from the SoundCom acquisition. Rauland which was acquired in February 2017 continues to see robust demand for their communication solutions across their key health care and educational markets. It's driving strong organic growth. That team has really, really (00:58:47) fantastic job.","And we mentioned also in my prepared remarks our UPT, our Ultra Precision Technologies business, in particular ZYGO, TMC, Precitech and Taylor Hobson, all saw strong double-digit growth in the quarter. So for all of 2018, we now expect organic sales for our process business is to be up mid to high-single digits. So we increased the outlook for our process business to mid to high-single digits from mid-single digits.","And if I go to power and industrial, overall sales were up low-double digits in the quarter, driven by contributions from recent acquisitions of Arizona Instrument and Motec, along with low single-digit organic sales growth. We saw very solid growth across our power, test and measurement businesses in the quarter. That includes our programmable power and VTI businesses. And for all of 2018, we continue to expect organic sales for power and industrial to be up mid-single digits.","And finally, we saw good growth across our automation and engineered solutions business. It remains solid with high-single digit organic growth, but that business is doing really well benefiting from the global secular trends in automation. Dunkermotoren and Haydon Kerk continue to do an excellent job, expanding their growth funnels by targeting new precision automation applications. And in 2018, we continue to expect high-single digit organic sales growth for automation and engineered solutions businesses. That's around the horn, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co.

We will begin with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.","Dave Zapico","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. AMETEK had a great year. Capped off by an exceptional fourth quarter in which we exceeded our expectations and established records for essentially all key financial metrics. In the fourth quarter, we generated a record level of sales with a robust and broad-based organic sales growth. We also generated a record level of orders providing us with solid visibility as we enter 2018. We delivered excellent operating performance with a strong core margin expansion, a high quality of earnings and record diluted earnings per share.","We generated a record level of cash flow, while continue to deploy those cash flow on a strategic acquisitions having just announced two new acquisitions simply put the AMETEK model is working. As we look ahead, we remain confident on our ability to deliver strong performance in 2018. I\u2019ll provide more details on our 2018 guidance in a moment, but first let me provide the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year results.","Our fourth quarter reported results included an after-tax gain of $75.5 million as the gain from the remeasurement of our tax deferred liabilities due to Tax Reform was offset in part by a change related to the repatriation of our unremitted foreign earnings and certain other items in the quarter including realignment costs and a charitable note donation to the AMETEK Foundation.","The AMETEK Foundation is the charitable honor of AMETEK. It focuses its support on early childhood education, health and welfare and social programs in the communities where AMETEK has a presence. As a result of Tax Reform, we made a $5 million donation to our charitable foundation in the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll comment further on Tax Reform and the impact on AMETEK in a moment. Please note that any references made on this call to 2016 or 2017 financial results will be on an adjusted basis excluding the fourth quarter of 2017 items noted above and the fourth quarter of 2016 realignment cost.","AMETEK\u2019s fourth quarter sales were a record $1.14 billion, up 17%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Organic sales were excellent up 9% in the quarter with acquisitions adding 6% and foreign currency providing a 2% benefit to sales. Organic sales growth remains broad based across each of our businesses in key geographies. It reflects the continuation of the global synchronized growth I spoke to last quarter combined with the strength of our businesses in our niche positions across attractive growth markets.","We're also very pleased with the strength and orders as fourth quarter orders continue excellent pace of growth we experienced in the first three quarters of the year. Overall, orders were up 19% in the fourth quarter with organic orders up 9%. This level of orders growth enabled us to end 2017 with a record backlog of $1.4 billion. Operating income in the quarter was a record $251.4 million, up 18% over the same period in 2016. Operating income margins were 22%, up 10 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the dilutive impact on margins from recent acquisitions, operating income margins in the quarter were 22.4%, up 50 basis points compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Diluted earnings per share were a record at $0.70 in the quarter, representing an impressive 21% increase compared to the $0.58 reported in the same quarter of last year. AMETEK\u2019s businesses continue to operate at a very high level, generating tremendous cash flow. Operating cash flow was a record $253 million in the fourth quarter and free cash flow conversion was an excellent 137% of adjusted net income.","Now for the full year of 2017. AMETEK established records across all key financial measures. Sales were a record $4.3 billion up 12% over 2016 and organic sales were up 6%. Full year orders were also excellent about 18% overall and 10% organically with broad-based strength across our businesses. Operating income was $936.9 million, up 11% over last year while operating margins were 21.8% for the full year. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions on margins, full year operating margins were up 22.2%, up 30 basis points over 2016.","Full year 2017 diluted earnings per share for a record $2.61, up 13% compared to $2.30 in 2016. Lastly, our cash flow generation for the full year was exceptional with operating cash flow up 17% to a record $883.3, excluding a $50 million pension contribution in the first quarter of 2017.","Now turning to the individual operating groups, first the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG sales in the fourth quarter increased 20% versus the prior year to a record $741.5 million. Organic sales were strong, up 9% in the quarter. The acquisitions of Rauland and MOCON contributed 10% and foreign currency was a two point tailwind. EIG\u2019s operating income in the quarter was a record $195.6 million, up 20% over the prior year, and operating incomes were very strong at 26.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, EIG margins were a superb 27.5%, up 110 basis points over the last year.","The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter. EMG\u2019s sales were up 13% year-over-year to $401.6 million. Organic sales growth was broad based, up 10% over last year. The acquisition of Laserage contributed 1% and foreign currency contributed 2%. EMG\u2019s operating income in the quarter was $74.2 million, up 18% over the same period in 2016. Fourth quarter operating margins were 18.5%, up 80 basis points over last year. In summary, AMETEK results in the fourth quarter and for the full year were outstanding.","I want to extend my thanks to all AMETEK colleagues for their excellent work and congratulate them on the great successes in 2017. While we benefited from the strong global macro environment, our team continues to execute each of AMETEK\u2019s growth strategies and deliver excellent performance in the short-term while positioning their businesses well for long-term success. Before I discuss our outlook for 2018, I want to touch on some of these averages, which are powering AMETEK success.","First, acquisitions. We remain very active on the acquisition front having just announced the acquisitions of two businesses: FMH Aerospace and Arizona Instrument. FMH Aerospace, which we acquired in January, is a leading provider of highly engineered and differentiated components for use in the aerospace, defense and space markets. Their products are used to facilitate the transfer of fluids and gases, extreme temperatures and pressures with highly demanding mission critical applications.","FMH is currently supporting more than 100 strategic platforms with applications that include aircraft fuel systems, auxiliary power units and cabin pressurization. FMH is an excellent addition to our thermal management systems division as it brings strong positions across a range of attractive aerospace and defense platforms while providing us with highly complimentary products and solutions. FMH is based in Irvine, California and has annual sales of approximately $50 million. We deployed approximately $235 million on the acquisition.","Arizona Instrument, which we acquired in late December, develops a manufacture of high quality precision instrumentation measurements for high value applications. There are advanced moisture and toxic gas analysis instrumentation, serves several markets with attractive growth dynamics including food, pharmaceuticals and environmental. Arizona has an attractive mix of aftermarket sales at approximately 40%. Arizona Instrument decisively complements our Brookfield viscosity measurement business, which we acquired in 2016 allowing us to further expand AMETEK\u2019s product offering in these attractive secular growth markets. Arizona Instruments is based in Chandler, Arizona and has annual sales of approximately $15 million. We deployed approximately $38 million on the acquisition.","Over the last twelve months, we have acquired four businesses, deployed nearly $800 million in capital and acquired approximately $290 million in sales revenue, essentially achieving our stated strategy of deploying our free cash flow on acquisitions. Our business and M&A teams remain very active and are managing a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. Given our excellent cash flow generation, the strength of our balance sheet and now more flexibility with respect to our foreign cash due to Tax Reform, we have significant financial capacity available to deploy on strategic acquisitions.","We're also seeing great results from our new product development strategy. New products are an interval component of our long-term success. Through our investments in new products and technologies, our businesses are helping their customers to solve their most complex challenges. Our teams were very active and successful in 2017 introducing many outstanding new products. Our vitality index, which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions, introduced within the last three years continues to reflect the great success from our work. In the fourth quarter, our vitality index was a very strong 24%.","AMETEK also continues to invest meaningfully in our research and development and engineering. In 2017, we invested approximately $221 million in RD&E, up 10% from 2016. And in 2018, we expect to increase our investments to approximately $235 million, up 6% over 2017. Lastly, our business has continued to deliver outstanding performance from our operational excellence initiatives. In 2017 along with excellent working capital management, we realized more than $100 million in savings with most of these savings coming from our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. ","In 2018, we expect to achieve approximately $85 million in savings from our operational excellence initiatives with the majority being driven through our sourcing and procurement activities. In addition to the strong success of our OpEx tools focused on productivity improvements, we're seeing positive results from the expansion of our operational excellent tools focused on the front-end or customer-facing part of our business. We are very pleased with the success we have seen and expect this success will continue to contribute to our organic growth.","I want to take a moment to comment on Tax Reform and AMETEK\u2019s capital deployment strategy. Not surprisingly Tax Reform is a positive for AMETEK. We will see a lower effective tax rate. We have better and more efficient access to our foreign cash, which will provide us with additional flexibility. And although not a large direct benefit to us given our asset like business model, it is likely it will benefit our customers that will consider accelerated capital expenditures given the full expensing of certain capital investments. However the benefits of Tax Reform do not change AMETEK\u2019s fundamental approach to investment and capital allocation.","We will continue to invest appropriately back into our businesses to support the growth initiatives. Following these internal investments, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions as does our stated objective of deploying our free cash flow on acquisitions. We will continue to make opportunistic share repurchases and we will continue to be able pay a modest dividend as we have done in the past. With respect to the dividend, we announced today that our Board of Directors approved a 56% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting the strength and confidence we have in our underlying cash flows. This increase brings our regularly quarter rate to $0.14 per share from our indicated annual rate to $0.56 per share. We have last raised our dividend in 2014 and this raise increases our dividend yield to the desire range of between 0.5% and 1%.","Now let me turn to the outlook for 2018. For the full year, we anticipate overall sales will be up 7% to 9% compared to 2017. Organic sales are expected to be up 3% to 5% with similar levels of organic growth expected across each of our reportable segments. 2018 earnings per diluted share expected to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.05 reflecting a 13% to 17% increase compared to 2017\u2019s adjusted earnings of $2.61 per diluted share. The guidance range reflects the expected tax benefit from Tax Reform and assumes an approximate 23% effective rate in 2018 versus our 26% effective rate in 2017.","In the first quarter, sales are projected to be up low double-digits compared to the first quarter of 2017 with organic sales up mid single-digits. First quarter diluted earnings per share are anticipated to fall within the range of $0.70 to $0.72, up 17% to 20%, compared to the first quarter of last year. To summarize, AMETEK finished an outstanding year with an exceptionally strong quarter. Our businesses and the world-class teams are well positioned for another year of growth and sustainable long-term success.","I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter and the year. And then we will glad to take your questions. Bill?","Bill Burke","Thank you, Dave. As Dave has noted, AMETEK had an excellent quarter. We delivered a record level of performance with a very high quality of earnings. I will provide some additional color on our financial highlights. We will also provide more details on the impact of Tax Reform on AMETEK and our reported results. First let me touch on Tax Reform. As a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, AMETEK recognized a gain of $185.8 million, or $0.80 per share, in the fourth quarter. This one-time non-cash gain was a result of the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities.","Also as a result of Tax Reform, we incurred a $94.2 million, or $0.41 per share charge in the fourth quarter related to repatriation and associated withholding taxes. The net impact of these tax adjustments resulted in a gain in the fourth quarter of $91.6 million, or $0.39 per share. This gain should be considered provisional and maybe subject to further adjustment during the measurement period. This gain was offset in part by certain other items in the quarter. First, we took a pre-tax realignment charge of $16.8 million or $0.05 per share. This charge will allow us to better position our long-term cost structure and includes cost associated with the final stages of the consolidation of our floor care and specialty motors business with our precision motion control business.","And second, we made a pre-tax $5 million, or $0.01 per share, charitable donation to the AMETEK Foundation in the fourth quarter due to the benefits from Tax Reform. Combined these other items totaled $21.8 million pre-tax, $16.1 million after-tax or $0.06 per share So as a result of Tax Reform and these other items, the reported gain included in our fourth quarter GAAP earnings was $75.5 million or $0.33 per share.","Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, core selling expenses were up in line with core sales growth. General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were up over the prior year due largely to higher compensation expense. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.7% versus last year\u2019s rate of 27.1% and was in line with our expectation. We are still evaluating the impact of Tax Reform on our go forward effective tax rate, however, based on current information available we have estimated our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 23% given our expected benefits from Tax Reform. As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.","Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was excellent at 16.8% of sales in the fourth quarter, down from 18.4% in the same period of 2016 reflecting the great performance of our businesses. Capital expenditures were $29 million in the quarter and $75 million for the full year. 2018 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $85 million or 1.9% of sales. Depreciation and amortization was $52 million in the quarter and $183 million for the full year. We expect 2018 depreciation and amortization to be approximately $200 million.","Our businesses continue to generate excellent cash flow. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was a record $253 million and fourth quarter cash flow was $223 million, representing a very strong 137% of adjusted net income. Our full year cash flow was also excellent. Excluding the $50 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, 2017 operating cash flow was $883 million, up 17% from 2016 with full year free cash flow of $808 million or 133% of adjusted net income. For 2018, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 120% of net income. We continue to successfully deploy our strong cash flow on strategic acquisitions. In 2017, we deployed approximately $560 million on the acquisitions of Rauland, MOCON and Arizona Instrument and thus far in 2018 we have deployed approximately $235 million on the acquisition of FMH Aerospace.","Total debt at December 31 was $2.17 billion, down from $2.34 billion at the end of 2016. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $646 million, resulting in a net-debt-to-capital ratio at December 31 of 27.5%. After the acquisition of FMH Aerospace, we have approximately $1.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter capping off the year with excellent results and high quality of earnings with our strong balance sheet, cash flows, proven growth strategies we are excited as we look ahead to 2018.","Kevin?","Kevin Coleman","Great, thank you, Bill. Andrew, can we please open the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Allison Poliniak","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Dave Zapico","Good morning, Allison.","Allison Poliniak","So margins continue to push higher here. As you look 2018, particularly on the organic side, how should we be thinking about that entering this year? How far can you push them going forward and obviously you\u2019re investing in there as well?","Dave Zapico","Right, right. Well the way we think about it is we have a lot of runway for margins. And we think we can increase our margins, ex-acquisitions about 30 basis points. So the same thing we did in the 2017. So 30 bps is probably a good way to think about it. And if you look at our 2017 results, we got about \u2013 on the incremental sales we are up about 35% incremental margin and that\u2019s what we\u2019re targeting for 2018 also.","Allison Poliniak","Great. And then you touched on it a little bit in your remarks, but it\u2019s sort of you\u2019re expecting sort of a likely benefit from the Tax Reform and increased capital expenditures. Can you maybe talk to sort of the order increase that you\u2019ve received thus far? Does it feel like it\u2019s accelerating to you guys or not really?","Dave Zapico","Yeah, it\u2019s a \u2013 I think our orders were accelerating before Tax Reform and its continuing. So, we can\u2019t point to specific customers telling us that are ordering because of the Tax Reform, but we can\u2019t point to broad-based order strength across our portfolio that\u2019s continuing and it\u2019s continuing into January. We\u2019ve got \u2013 January orders were in line with what we expected. So it\u2019s strong. It\u2019s continuing its strength. It's all geographies and it\u2019s all of our businesses. So it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint how much is from Tax Reform and how much of it\u2019s just the general synchronized growth across the globe, but it is the good market. The one point I add to that is a lot of customers are now talking about their next generations and new designs and some new projects that are floating into the pipeline. So it feels good looking forward.","Allison Poliniak","Great, thanks so much.","Dave Zapico","Great.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Andrew Obin","Yeah, good morning, guys.","Dave Zapico","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just sort of big picture question for companies that does a lot of acquisitions. How do you guys think about cost of capital and return hurdles as interest rates go up?","Dave Zapico","Right. Yeah, the one thing about our acquisition strategy is that we haven\u2019t changed our key hurdle rate. So it\u2019s the return on capital of 10% in a third year of owning a business for the return on invested capital. And we use that throughout the \u2013 in times when interest rates are lower and times when interest rates were higher. So the current environment is very similar to what we have been experiencing. So that \u2013 and we plan on applying the same process. So we think that\u2019s reflected on our balance sheet. Our balance sheet as a return on total capital of a NOPAT average, total capital of about 12%, which is a really good rate for an acquisitive company and we consider our cost of capital of about 8%.","So the strength between the 12% and the 8% is what we\u2019re providing to our shareholders in the long-term. And we don\u2019t think that we\u2019re still going to stay focused on our disciplined approach and the 10% ROIC in year three. And we\u2019re seeing a similar environment to what have seen over the two years. The pricing is elevated. There is plenty of cash chasing deals, but despite this we have been successful in deploying our free cash flow and value enhancing acquisitions.","Andrew Obin","Right, so you were never a spread company?","Dave Zapico","No, we\u2019re never a spread company. We\u2019ve always been an absolute company.","Andrew Obin","And just a question on payout ratio, and I apologize I delve in a little bit late; fairly significant increase in the payout has philosophy on dividends change going forward.","Dave Zapico","No, the philosophy hasn\u2019t changed. The primary use of free cash flow is acquisitions. Secondarily, it\u2019s opportunistic buybacks. And the dividend, we continue to pay a modest dividend. And basically, we last raised our dividend about four years ago. It was in the neighborhood of 50% and this is four years later and we\u2019re raising it to 57%. So it\u2019s the same philosophy we want to reward our shareholders because we\u2019re very confident on our underlying cash flows, but it really doesn\u2019t changed the fundamental capital allocation strategy of the business. M&A is the clear priority.","Andrew Obin","So we should not expect a series of dividend increases that run well ahead of earnings growth, right.","Dave Zapico","No, I would say no. I view this increase is catching up and I would not expect it to run ahead of earnings growth.","Andrew Obin","Thanks a lot guys, great quarter.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Bill Burke","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Robert McCarthy","I would echo the strong quarter, gentlemen, particularly the organic growth.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Robert McCarthy","A couple questions, a couple questions if you don't mind. I will leave \u2013 I will leave around the horn to Mr. Graham. But what I would ask is number one have you looked at a lot of serial acquisition stories, high quality, mid-caps like yourself have looked and some of actually changed accounting to going to excluding amortization. And now it looks like on the basis of my fuzzy math amortization for you on a guidance basis, I mean, it's something looks like it's \u2013 I don\u2019t know north of $100 million a year, could be $0.50, maybe it\u2019s much higher than that. But have you think that \u2013 made that accounting change because if you look at the underlying, how your business is run and operated. It's really about cash and backing that out might be a better way for investors to look at how to value your company over time. Have you looked at that and what are your thoughts?","Dave Zapico","Yeah, it's a great question. We get the question occasionally. We decided not to do it this year. We're still talking to our investors. I mean you just figure it out pretty easily. And we think our investors can figure it out. So we use the GAAP earnings to talk about our EPS. Some of our peers have changed the cash EPS. We're not saying that we're not going to do it and we're not saying that we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019ll think about it then we give everybody some heads-up if we\u2019re going to do that, but right now we decided to stay a GAAP company.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And just to amplify your comments about capital allocation. Obviously, you deployed a lot of capital recently, done some solid presumably niche and bolt-on deals. But where we stand today given \u2013 Tax Reform given how you\u2019re feeling about your businesses? Could you talk about the state of play for how much capital you think you could deploy over the next two years in this environment to drive value?","Dave Zapico","I\u2019d point to Bill\u2019s comment. He talked about $1.5 billion of dry power essentially from cash and existing flexibility on our credit lines. And I also add to that the free cash flow of the business will be somewhere around $850 million next year. So if we add those two up, we clearly can deploy greater than $1 billion with relative ease and our stated strategy is to deploy our free cash flow. So that would be our target, but if we wanted to we could flex it and go to much higher levels, north of $2 billion. So that\u2019s the way we think about it and we look for good targets and we want to make sure we\u2019re deploying the capital with good businesses and our business that return on capital.","So our strategy really is not capital constrained. It's our deal pipeline, and looking at these different deals that we have, all good businesses. But we have to pick the deals but we have the most value too. And in the selection of those deals is really the limber on the growth and we have a great pipeline, but we\u2019re picking the deals in an environment that has higher prices and still giving our shareholders the same return on capital. If we get a larger deal or we get many smaller deals, we have a financial capacity to do them and we\u2019re certainly increasing efforts on the \u2013 in the M&A. We now have an 11 individuals dedicated to the pipeline work and we feel real good about our pipeline.","Robert McCarthy","Just the last one, as a follow-up, I would say specifically in terms of large deals, is there tension in the pipeline to look at larger deals or is there a goal to look at larger deals? And how do you look at the opportunities out there because you get the fixed cost leverage of integrating these deals and getting good returns? I mean could you just comment on that?","Dave Zapico","Yeah, I mean, we have expanded our pipeline to include larger deals. Now, larger deals for us are not of the size of AMETEK or half the size of AMETEK. We\u2019re talking about of kind of one notch up from what we\u2019re looking to do, deals that are maybe $200 million, $300 million of revenue. And those are in our pipeline and we\u2019re working through it. So we could do deal of that size and maybe deployments of capital of a $1 billion and we\u2019re looking at those kind of business. Our financial flexibility looks compatible. But we don\u2019t need to do those kinds of deals to deliver double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders. We\u2019re staffed to do six to eight deals a year and that can be $50 million, $100 million deals and we\u2019re perfectly comfortable doing of that size deal and growing at 15% a year on average.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks so much.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you. Good morning. Happy, February.","Dave Zapico","Chris, good morning.","Christopher Glynn","See just I am wondering on the upside in the quarter was that more like backlog conversion was faster than expected or the kind of in quarter orders came in and converted? And if there's any insight in and answering the question?","Dave Zapico","Yeah, I think we executed very well and we were able to convert a lot of incoming orders in the quarter to sales. And there was some business, additional business investment tied to year end spend that resulted especially in our process business, some year-end spend that we were able to convert on. And we ended the year at $1.4 billion backlog. So we kind of have our cake and we got to eat it to because we had a great Q4 and we have real good visibility to 2018.","Christopher Glynn","And nice cake. And then on the Tax Reform as you look at your global corporate entities or the acquisitions you've done over time and the brick strategies over time, is there any key signification opportunities that might be significant from a cost perspective?","Bill Burke","I think as we \u2013 we obviously, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done as guidance gets issued and the like. I think we -- certainly, this will simplify things and we'll have to look at our structures. I don't think that would say that there's huge cost benefits that are going to come from that. I think it's going to be more about continuing to look at tax planning strategies and see if we can take the rate down from that 23% level that we have baked into the forecast. But that's going to be something that we\u2019re going to really play out over the next year or more as we get the full understanding of it and be able to try and plan and act accordingly.","Christopher Glynn","Got it. Thanks, Bill.","Bill Burke","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is Jeff on for Deane. My question is about your acquisition of FMH Aerospace. In the price-to-sales ratio, 4.7 times roughly, I mean it just looks notionally large. Can you maybe talk about your organic growth rates of that business and maybe the synergies and what percent of that business is aftermarket?","Dave Zapico","Sure, yeah, on a price-to-sales ratio, it may look a bit rich but it's 11 times EBITDA and it's a very profitable business. It's more profitable than the AMETEK average. So we bought a business that's really well positioned. They're a manufacturer of highly engineered products that facilitate the transfer of fuels and gas us at very high temperatures and pressures and really demanding applications. An example application would be in-air tanking refueler. So if you think about an in-air tanking refueler connecting to a jet and refueling it. FMH builds the components. They don't build the whole system, but they build key components within the air refueling systems. So these are very differentiated components. It's a unique business that has unique capability. They're a leader in a niche, attractive growth profile. We're at the high-single digit grower.","And even though it's a very profitable business, we have a very healthy level of cost synergy built into our model. So in terms of the go-forward growth rate, we have a division of AMETEK, our TMS division that really is in the same market and has already made sales force to sell the FMH products globally and that's something they really haven't done. So we're really excited about what FHM does for AMETEK. It's an excellent strategic fit and we think it's a great business and we're going to get the same kind of returns on capital that we do with all our deals.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you. And just last maybe just talking about Tax Reform and M&A. So with the lower tax rate, we're expecting maybe less tax leakage on transactions. Are you seeing any more targets come on the market? Or do you expect more activity this year?","Dave Zapico","You know, our pipeline has been pretty full through 2017 and it's continuing in 2018. So it's not like we came in the door on January 1 and the target started coming in the door. These are very few things surprise us when they're sold because of our business development pipeline and our information's so good. And I would characterize it as a strong market, as strong as it was last year for us, but we really haven't seen a spike because of tax reform.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Matt Summerville","Thanks, good morning.","Dave Zapico","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Summerville","A couple of questions. First, where were you on price in 2017? What is your expectation for 2018? And then maybe if you could talk about where you were in terms of spread between price [indiscernible] in 2017 and what your expectation is for 2018?","Bill Burke","Right, I think the pricing for us improved a bit in the fourth quarter compared to the first half of the year. I will start with the Q4. And in Q4, we achieved price of about 1.5 points across our entire portfolio. And total inflation was up a bit more. It was about a little \u2013 a bit more than 1%. So we had a positive spread there. And it was very balanced across our portfolio with similar results and no real outliers. And when we look to 2018, we expect the conditions similar to Q4 to continue playing out. We have in our 2018 model for our budget about 1.5 points of price and we think inflation will pick up to about 1.2%. So we got a positive spread there. As you know we have been able to offset increasing cost with price. We're leaders in niche markets that speak to the differentiated nature of our AMETEK product portfolio. The leadership position we have in our niche markets and we look at it as only fair that we can pass inflation on to our customer base.","Matt Summerville","And as a follow-up, can you just give us a little more detail around what you're doing with restructuring or repositioning of the floor care and specialty motors business into the PMC, please, and what [indiscernible]?","Dave Zapico","Good question, Matt. Thanks. Yeah, we basically have \u2013 we've consolidated our floor care and specialty motors business into our precision motion control business given the strong operational and technology synergies that exist between those businesses. As we talked about the business over the last couple of years, we talked about our floor care business, migrating their business and customer portfolio away from the legacy floor care motors market into higher end markets and applications. And this transition has been incredibly successful.","Now only about $50 million of our sales are in the floor care market. So it's a really, really small part of AMETEK. And those customer bases have changed to specialized industrial, food and beverage, which require higher levels of engineering support, technology development and provide stronger growth and margin characteristics. So we put those businesses together. We combined the management teams earlier in 2017 and then \u2013 we just really \u2013 there's some final stages, some strategic cost reductions that we're going \u2013 through this realignment cost that we're going to address.","And we've actually now \u2013 if you think about what was the old differentiated EMG, one of the markets in the company, and floor care, we've actually combined floor care and now we're going to call that automation and engineered solutions. So that's the fourth segment, and it's really a result of this consolidation. So it's the old PMC plus EMIP, and that's reflects the automation demand driver for the PMC business and it includes the engineered solutions business.","Matt Summerville","Thanks, Dave.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Richard Charles","Yes, Good morning.","Dave Zapico","Good morning, Richard.","Richard Charles","Dave, could you kind of speak maybe to the segments for 2018? As we look out, core growth for 2018 was kind of guided maybe 3% to 5%. Could you just speak to maybe how EIG and EMG falls into that 3% to 5% guide? And also, I just wanted to ask similar question for 2018 around aerospace and what the expectation is for all of aerospace?","Dave Zapico","Okay. Yeah, it's very similar with both EIG and EMG. We have 3% to 5% organic for both of them and total sales for both of them are high-single digits. So there's not much difference in the sales growth between the different groups. And it reflects the broad-based improvements that I talked to earlier. In terms of aerospace, our overall aerospace sales, we have a solid 2018. We were up mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, very solid year across all of our segments. They all grew in 2017.","And we think that looking ahead in 2018, we're going to expect organic sales for overall aerospace business to be up mid-single digits with similar growth expected across each of our market segments. And the one change that we saw \u2013 really 2 changes that we saw in 2017, the military market really improved and we expect that continuing mid-single-digit growth for that. And we also saw some improvement in the business in regional jet market and we're expecting that to continue. So we really got a solid commercial environment. We want some share on business jets that\u2019s allowing us to grow there and the military is strong. So we\u2019re pretty optimistic about aerospace in 2018 and we think it will be a mid-single-digit grower for the total business.","Richard Charles","Okay. And then I just had a question around the gross margin in the quarter, if I \u2013 can I assume in the fourth quarter that much of that $16 million of realignment costs was taken against in COGS? I\u2019m curious if you make that adjustment, gross margin looks a little bit more normalized, but the trend still down year-over-year. And I\u2019m curious with the moving mix here, EIG strength, what\u2019s the outlook for gross margin here? And maybe what\u2019s kind of depressing that a little bit relative to the volume strength?","Bill Burke","Yes. I mean because we have so many different businesses on our portfolio, we really don\u2019t focus on gross margin as much as operating income margin and there\u2019s a lot of mixed dynamics and there are different product dynamics and there is the restructuring. So with positive price to inflation, there is not an issue or a problem of gross margin. So\u2026","Richard Charles","Okay. And can you remind me some of the RD&E step-up also gets accounted for in the COGS. Is that correct?","Bill Burke","It does. If you think about that, almost all of our RD&E is in COGS. So that reflects the increased spending that we have. So that will be part of the gross margin and actually a little bit of divisional G&A shows up there too.","Richard Charles","Okay, alright.","Bill Burke","So that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to compare our G&A with other companies because of what it reflects. It\u2019s just been a historical way we\u2019ve done it.","Richard Charles","Yeah, I understand. And then\u2026","Bill Burke","The operating income margins instead.","Richard Charles","Yeah, and then the last question, when you talk about the operational excellence savings and the commentary around maybe $85 million of savings targeted for 2018 versus slightly over $100 million in 2017 actual, any thought there? So a little less targeted savings. Is some of that just accounted for maybe in the realignment charge?","Bill Burke","Yes. If you think about the sourcing savings and material savings, which is the predominant driver of the cost last year, they\u2019re about flat, its $65 million both years. So, still really, really good year in sourcing savings. What\u2019s really happening is last year, we had some realignment expenses that benefited the year 2017 and the realignment that we talked about in the last quarter of 2017 is more long-term in nature. So we\u2019ll get benefit from that, not so much benefit in 2018, but it will benefit in 2019 and 2020. So that\u2019s the difference between those two numbers. The realignment charge is more long-term and the sourcing savings is about the same.","Richard Charles","Okay, alright, thank you.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning guys. This is Tristan in for Joe today. I just wanted to maybe check your level of inventory and how it compares to the last few months and also the level of inventory at your partners and at your distributors. Thank you.","Dave Zapico","Yes. We don\u2019t deal a lot through distributors. So a lot of our products are sold direct. So there isn\u2019t usually a distribution inventory issue. I mean what I can say is our inventory terms were excellent. They were up, I guess, about 4.9, 4.8 turns in the quarter and last year Q4 2016 they\u2019re about 4.4 turns. So a lot of the benefits that we got from working capital for improved inventory turn. So we're executing very well. The inventory is turning quicker. The working capital was, as Bill mentioned, less than 17% about 16.8%. So we\u2019re operating very well. Inventory is turning. And in the niche custom business that we have, that\u2019s a really good rate.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank, Dave. I\u2019ll go back in the queue.","Dave Zapico","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brett Kearney with Gabelli and Company. Your line is now open.","Brett Kearney","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Dave Zapico","Hi, Brett.","Brett Kearney","You touched on a bit in your prepared remarks, but I wanted to ask whether you\u2019re seeing any indications at all thus far this year. I know it\u2019s early, but just in terms of customers exploring or committing to more of the larger capital projects already this year?","Dave Zapico","Yes. I hit that a little bit. I mean we saw good capital projects in 2017. We saw them in \u2013 a little bit in the Middle East in terms of oil and gas. It helped our mid downstream business. We saw the defense market turn on projects had been shutdown for a while. And as we enter 2018, it seems like new projects are surfacing in our pipelines. It feels like some of our customers that we deal with on an OEM basis are designing new products. So it feels like its definitely solid and it feels like it could be accelerating, but we\u2019re not factoring that into our guidance. We\u2019re expecting the continuing growth, but there's a lot of activity in these sales pipelines.","Brett Kearney","Yep, thank you.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with the BMO. Your line is now open.","Scott Graham","Hey, good morning David, Bill. Kevin, how are you?","Dave Zapico","Hey, Scott.","Bill Burke","Good morning.","Kevin Coleman","Good.","Scott Graham","I want to ask a question on organic and, obviously, the trends there have been good. Although you\u2019ll admit that the comps have been easy. And now in the fourth quarter the comp gets harder and that will be harder again in 2018. Essentially, my question is this is that we see a pretty good order book. We\u2019re coming out of the fourth quarter with momentum. You\u2019re saying mid-single in the first quarter yet you\u2019re saying 3 to 5 for the full year. Is that sort of may be more look before your leap guidance? Or is there something that you\u2019re seeing maybe in the second half of the year where some market or group of market slows?","Dave Zapico","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing any market slowdown or we\u2019re not assuming any slowdown. And I think you might have answered your own question because we do have tougher comps later in the year. So the organic growth guidance of 4% at the midpoint assumes we have some \u2013 a little bit of easier comp in Q1. But as we progress through 2018, the comps are going to get difficult, but the markets are not slowing down.","Scott Graham","Fair enough. Is there anything that stops you \u2013 from where you sit today, Dave, anything that you think will stop you from getting to that 7% to 8% goal for acquisitions, adding to sales in that amount? It just sounds to me like the pipeline is pretty good. You announced a couple today. Are we \u2013 do you see \u2013 I don\u2019t want to ask you if you have a line of sight, you never want line of sight on anything when it comes to M&A. But is there anything that you think that interrupts that?","Dave Zapico","The best way I can explain it is that I'm confident because we have such a refined M&A process. We have a dedicated team of M&A professionals. It allows for a broad set of opportunities from which we can identify the best fits. So I feel really confident that we'll be able to deliver that over the long run. But you know as well as I do on M&A, predicting a particular deal or 2 deals or 3 deals in a quarter or a year is pretty difficult because things can happen and we're very particular and we do a lot of due diligence, but I feel extremely confident because of our capability, our processes around deal sourcing and deal modeling, diligence and integration. So, incredibly confident on long-term to get that kind of number, but it's very difficult in the short term just by the nature of the M&A world.","Robert Scott","Understood and my last question is the [indiscernible]. Maybe you can kind of give us a sketch on the \u2013 sort of the business units themselves within each segment.","Dave Zapico","Right, I'll go through each of the markets and I'll start with our process business. Our process business had an excellent fourth quarter. Overall sales were up more than 25% driven by contributions from both acquisitions and organic growth. Rauland and MOCON are both performing exceptionally well and they're delivering solid performance while they\u2019re successfully and positively integrating into AMETEK. And organic growth in the fourth quarter for Process was excellent. It was 10%. It was particularly robust with our high-end research instrumentation including business like CAMECA, Zygo and AMETEK, had very good, very good course especially in Asia.","We also benefited in the quarter from some solid year-end spending across the board in process. And in 2018, we expect continued broad-based sales growth with organic sales up mid-single digits. Aerospace side, I answered Rick's question. I'll get with that one. Overall, mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. All of our segments were good. Military and business jets were particularly strong. And looking ahead to 2018, we expect organic sales for our overall aerospace business to be up mid-single digits with similar growth expected across each market segment. Our Power & Industrial segment finished the year strong with mid-single-digit growth, organic growth in the fourth quarter. We saw growth in both our Power & Industrial businesses with notable strength in our power instruments business.","And in 2018, we expect low to mid-single-digit organic growth for our Power & Industrial businesses. And finally, as I mentioned previously, our fourth market, our automation and engineered solutions. Our automation and engineered solutions businesses completed an outstanding year, impressive double-digit organic growth sales in the quarter. We continue to see excellent growth across our businesses serving automation markets as well as our EMIP businesses. So looking ahead to 2018, we expect mid-single-digit organic growth from that market.","Robert Scott","Thank you.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.

Thank you, Jenisha. Good morning. Welcome to AMETEK's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Frank Hermance, Chairman and CEO, Bob Mandos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Dave Zapico, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","AMETEK's first quarter results were released earlier this morning.

We will begin today with prepared remarks, and then we will open it up to take questions.","I\u2019ll turn the meeting over now to Frank.","Frank S. Hermance","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered solid earnings in the first quarter, despite a very challenging global macro environment. Overall demand across a number of our markets remains weak. In particular, we\u2019re seeing meaningful headwinds within our oil and gas and metals markets. These headwinds are larger than we anticipated when we started the year. Although these short-term headwinds are challenging, we remain confident in the long-term positioning and growth prospects for our business.","Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references made to 2015 results, will be on an adjusted basis, excluding the realignment costs in 2015. Now onto the financial results.","In the first quarter, sales declined 4% to $944.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%, acquisitions added 5%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind during the quarter. Operating income for the first quarter declined 12% to $208.5 million, and operating income margin in the quarter was 22.1% versus 24.1% in the first quarter of 2015.","Net income for the quarter was $134.2 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.57 were down 10% over last year's first quarter, meeting our Street guidance. Operating cash flow was $152 million in the quarter, up 24% over the prior year.","Now turning to the individual operating groups. The electronic instruments group reported a sales decline of 4% to $569 million for the quarter. Organic sales declined 8%. The acquisitions of Surface Vision, Brookfield Engineering and ESP\/SurgeX contributed 5%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind.","The lower sales versus prior year were driven largely by our process businesses, which had exposure to oil and gas markets. We\u2019re seeing incremental weakness above our prior expectations in oil and gas, both in the upstream, and in the mid and downstream markets.","EIG\u2019s operating income declined 12% to $141.8 million, and operating margins were 24.9% in the quarter versus 27% in last year\u2019s first quarter. The electromechanical group reported overall sales down 4% to $375.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%. The acquisition of Global Tubes added 6%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind.","The lower sales were driven largely by the impact from commodity price deflation in our Engineered Materials Interconnect & Packaging Business, as well as from soft demand in our floor care and specialty motors business.","EMG\u2019s operating income of $79.4 million was down 10% from last year's first quarter, and operating margins were 21.2% in the quarter, versus 22.7% in the first quarter of 2015.","I\u2019ll now provide some updates on our four growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and strategic acquisitions. Each of these strategies plays an integral role in the overall growth and success of AMETEK. We\u2019re focused on consistently executing on each of these strategies over the business cycle.","However, in slow growth environments, we increased our focus on strategic acquisitions and operational excellence initiatives, while ensuring, we continue to make targeted investments in research and development and global expansion.","First, let me touch on acquisitions. We\u2019ve had a good start to the year, acquiring two businesses in the first quarter, Brookfield Engineering Laboratories and ESP\/SurgeX. Combined, we deployed approximately $300 million in capital and acquired nearly $100 million in sales.","ESP\/SurgeX is a leader in power protection. Their patent protected products operate at the plug level, and monitor, protect, analyze, and diagnose power-related issues remotely or on-site. In addition, their products help control power to mission critical equipment.","ESP is a great strategic fit with our existing power protection platform. It is highly complementary with our recently acquired Powervar business, providing us with new opportunities for product innovation and market expansion. The company has annual sales of approximately $40 million and is headquartered in North Carolina.","Brookfield is the global leader in viscosity measurement instrumentation for quality control applications. The company provides a complete range of viscometers and rheometers, as well as instrumentation for the analysis of texture and powder flow. Key applications for Brookfield\u2019s products include research, development, and production of food and beverage, pharmaceutical, paint, and petroleum products.","The addition of Brookfield allows AMETEK to expand our laboratory instrumentation platform into a broader range of adjacent markets and applications. They\u2019re headquartered in Middleboro, Massachusetts with additional operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, China, and India and have annual sales of approximately $55 million.","The integration of both of these acquisitions is going very well. As part of our acquisition integration process, we conduct monthly integration meetings with each acquired company for at least the first six months following acquisition. These meetings are important drivers of the success of our acquisition strategy, as they allow us to closely monitor progress on key integration activities and value drivers during the critical early stages of the integration.","Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us. They will continue to be the primary use of our strong cash flow and financing facilities. Our acquisition and business teams remain very active, and so we\u2019re quite bullish on our opportunity to continue to deploy capital and create meaningful shareholder value.","Now turning to operational excellence, our management teams and employees are doing a great job, driving continued operational efficiencies and improvements through their businesses by leveraging our operational excellence tools. Our operational excellence initiatives take on even greater importance, and become more of a focus in slow growth environments.","For all of 2016, we now anticipate approximately $130 million of total operational excellence savings, with our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives driving approximately $60 million of the total savings. The total operational excellence savings is up from our initial estimate of $120 million, as a result of the continued strong efforts of our teams.","Now moving on to new products. We are pleased with the continuous success of our new product development activities. Our businesses are doing an outstanding job developing and introducing exciting new products. These new product developments are targeted at both expanding in existing markets, and penetrating adjacent markets.","Despite the slow growth environment, we continue to invest meaningfully in our new product development activities. In 2016, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E, up 5% from last year. We continue to see excellent results from this investment, as our vitality index which measures revenue from products introduced over the last three years, was 22% of sales in the quarter.","We have a number of notable new product introductions within the quarter. The new Xepos energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer from our SPECTRO Analytical Instruments business is considered a breakthrough product for performing elemental analysis. The compact bench-top unit incorporates a number of advances, that allow it to perform rapid multi-element analysis with greater accuracy and precision.","The instrument's enhancements make it suitable for demanding environmental and geological research, as well as precise at line quality control in chemical and petrochemical production, food processing, and pharmaceutical production.","The new Extreme Performance Series of MIL-XTM fans from AMETEK Rotron delivers best-in-class airflow for harsh and demanding military, aerospace, and industrial environments. The new fans feature shock proof Mil spec construction, and are optimized for electronic cooling applications. The fans are offered with a range of features that permit their use in a variety of situations and configurations. They can be used alone, or stacked with multiple fans to cool electronics, equipment racks, and personnel in airborne, land-based, and sea-borne installations.","Our Zygo business provided high precision optics that were used in the recent detection of gravitational waves that confirmed one of the key predictions in Einstein\u2019s 1915 general theory of relativity. The international team of scientists that collaborated on the discovery relied on advanced LIGO detectors that incorporated very high precision optical components manufactured by Zygo.","The optics manufactured to some sub nanometer tolerances are among the most precise optics ever made. I\u2019d like to recognize the Zygo team on their contribution to the success of this important global scientific project.","Now turning to global and market expansion. Global and market expansion continues to be an important part of our long-term growth. In the first quarter, international sales represented 53% of our total sales. We remain committed to expanding our presence in attractive higher growth regions and market segments through continued investments in our sales and service capabilities, and through the expansion of our technology into new adjacent market segments.","I want to highlight one of the recent success of our adjacent market expansion initiatives. Our process instruments business has pioneered near infrared tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy, or TDLAS technology. This technology has been very successful for use in online process applications within natural gas processing and petrochemical production.","The process instruments business is now adapting to TDLAS technology for use in online pharmaceutical processing, through modifying its existing Model 5100 Series analyzers to provide continuous process control of pharmaceutical drying. The use of this technology as an online analysis tool, allows manufacturers to obtain a clearer picture of the drying process in real time.","It is an economical and efficient technique for determining dryer endpoint detection, since it eliminates the need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to stop, analyze, and restart the drying process. The process instruments team is starting to see strong interest in this new market application for an existing technology.","Now turning to the outlook for 2016. As a result of the end market challenges, we now anticipate overall sales for 2016 to be roughly flat versus 2015, with organic sales down low to mid single-digits on a percentage basis versus 2015.","We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.42 to $2.52 per diluted share, down 1% to 5% over last year. Our overall second quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits, versus the second quarter of 2015. We estimate our second quarter earnings to be approximately $0.58 to $0.59 per diluted share, down 8% to 9% over last year's second quarter.","In summary, while the economic environment across many of our markets remains challenging and very difficult to predict, we remain focused on executing on the factors within our control. This includes deploying capital on strategic acquisitions, making growth investments in new product development and global expansion, and executing on our operational excellence initiatives. Our strong cash flow and prudent operating model give us confidence that we will continue our long track record of strong performance and shareholder value creation.","Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we will be glad to take your questions.","Robert R. Mandos","Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a solid first quarter. I\u2019ll provide some further details. In the quarter, organic selling expenses on a percentage basis were down the line with organic sales on a percentage basis. General administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales in the quarter, slightly above last year's first quarter level of 1.2% of sales.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%, down from last year\u2019s first quarter rate of 28.1%, and in line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing tax planning initiatives. For 2016, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 28%. As we\u2019ve said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from its full-year rate.","On the balance sheet, working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables was 20.8% of sales in the first quarter. Strong working capital and management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $11 million for the quarter. Full-year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million for the quarter. 2016 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $165 million.","Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $152 million, up 24% over last year\u2019s first quarter. Free cash flow was $141 million, representing 105% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 120% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy.","In the first quarter, we deployed $300 million for the acquisitions of Brookfield and ESP\/SurgeX. In addition in the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock for approximately $115 million. Total debt was $2.22 billion at March 31, up $280 million from 2015 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $386.9 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at March 31 of 35.7%.","At March 31, we had approximately $900 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. This amount includes the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended revolving credit facility we announced on March 11. This amended facility increases with the size of our revolving credit facility from $700 million to $850 million and extends the maturity date to March 2021, provides AMETEK with a larger financing capacity, and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives.","Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, our businesses performed well in the first quarter, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. We are well positioned, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows to support our growth initiatives.","Kevin C. Coleman","Great. Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. Jenisha, I\u2019d love to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Frank S. Hermance","Hello, Brian.","Brian Konigsberg","Hey, I just want to start off, maybe just more of a conceptual question. So, Q1 March, this may be the second or third quarter in a row where you fell short of expectations, on an operational basis. Just thinking about how you\u2019re thinking, when you go into the planning process for guidance, what is it that\u2019s changed that it\u2019s becoming a lot more difficult to guide in this market? We know obviously things are difficult, but we\u2019re not used to AMETEK falling short, like it has over the last few quarters. Have you cut kind of too close to the bone potentially, where it\u2019s becoming a little more difficult to guard against some of the shocks in the market, or are there other issues at play that you could maybe discuss?","Frank S. Hermance","No. The key factor here is, it surely it\u2019s not in terms of anything we\u2019ve done in terms of cost reductions, et cetera. The key issue is that we\u2019ve exposure on both sides of our Company to markets that are in a pretty significant downturn. Oil and gas is a major part of our Company, and we\u2019ve just seen over the course of the last several quarters, that it has deteriorated further than we had expected. You may recall that we had called oil and gas, in terms of the downturn last year. When we called it in January, we hit it right on. But this year, we did not hit it right on, and the conditions are worse.","If you look at oil and gas, we initially thought for 2016 with respect to 2015, we would be down around $50 million. Our best look now is down around $90 million and that changed. There was an inflection point actually, right around the time of our last earnings call, when oil hit $26 a barrel. And when that happened, we just saw a large number of projects just move to the right and that we were actually anticipating that we were going to get sooner. Most of those projects are still going to happen. But they're going to be moved, and probably moved, many of them into next year. So we miscalled that particular business. And it\u2019s simply because the changes have been so dramatic, and it\u2019s very difficult to predict them. It has really nothing to do with how we're operating the Company itself. It's just predicting the future is not an easy thing.","And I\u2019d say, similarly, if you look at the other side of the company with EMIP, with the issue with metals pricing, and the deflation that happened, and we talked about this in the fourth quarter. In a way, a similar thing happened that when metal prices went down so drastically, the buying levels from our customers just went very, very soft and have remained soft through the first quarter.","And now the good news, in that particular market is we\u2019re starting to feel improvement, where actually our order intake is improving. So we actually believe that one will improve as the year goes on. But we are not predicting that the oil and gas business will improve. So this is really a market related issue, with dramatic changes on each side of the Company, that\u2019s causing this problem.","Now given that and the contribution margins of our businesses, we are actually quite pleased with the operating performance in terms of profitability. We met our first quarter guidance on profitability. Margins, although down a bit, are still extremely good, one of the better ones in the industry. So we\u2019re managing a difficult situation, as well as I believe anybody could manage it so, but that's fundamentally what happened. I hope that helps.","Brian Konigsberg","That is helpful. Thanks, Frank. And maybe just secondly and obviously there are a lot of numbers that are going into this, but I don\u2019t know if you could simplify it. When I just look at your bridge, talking about flat sales for the year, obviously 4%, 5%, 6% -- percentage points of acquisition contribution, organic down. I presume there hasn't been a change in the assumption on price and inflation. I guess, price is offsetting inflation by a modest amount still. And then you're talking about productivity savings of $130 million. I still have a hard time kind of bridging the guidance to the new range that has been provided. In fact, I'm actually coming above the range. So, when I think about, when I put together the qualitative components, I'm coming out to an EPS that should be higher than where you're guiding. I thought that, probably for the last four or five quarters, and clearly that didn\u2019t materialize. But I was just curious if there are -- maybe you can kind of walk through some of the components that get you from the 2015 EPS, to the -- to your new guidance of, the new guidance range that you provided today?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, actually you can view it in relatively simple economic terms. The organic growth, if you look at the entire company, and you look at it for the year, we think we, and our guidance assumes, that we\u2019re going to be 2 points less on organic growth. And that\u2019s as a result of the two factors, predominantly that I talked about in answer to your first question. You take 2 points on a $4 billion company, that\u2019s $80 million. $80 million, the detrimental -- excuse me, they are detrimental too. Detrimental margins of this company, similarly to when they got, when volume goes up, are on the order of greater than 45%, roughly 50%. So just take the $80 million, multiply it -- I\u2019ll take -- make the numbers easy, 50%. You\u2019ve got $40 million of pre-tax operating income. And that\u2019s $0.12 or $0.13 a share.","Yes, we haven\u2019t put it through more cost reductions, about $10 million of additional cost reductions, over what we talked about last year -- or last quarter, excuse me, and you take that. And what happens, in many businesses, when the economic environment gets tough, is that basically people buy lower in the product portfolio. So that the overall sort of mix of the Company, for lack of a better word, goes down a bit. And that has, in essence, offset that $10 million of other cost improvements. In terms of price and inflation, what we told you at the beginning of the year, was that we expected price to essentially offset inflation, and that\u2019s still our expectation. So that is a very high level look. Obviously, there are puts and there are takes. But that\u2019s the overall thought process. And you take that, and that is the reduction in the guidance essentially.","Brian Konigsberg","And the investment spend of $60 million \u2026","Frank S. Hermance","It\u2019s $60 million on investment, absolutely. We have not changed the investment spend. So we\u2019re continuing to make the investments, so that when we get some market lift, the contribution margins are obviously going to be extremely high in the other direction, and we are going to make a lot of money.","Brian Konigsberg","Understood. Thank you for the detail. I appreciate it.","Frank S. Hermance","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.","Allison Poliniak","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance","Hello, Allison.","Allison Poliniak","On the energy side, Frank, let me just ask you -- I know historically you\u2019ve had some level of visibility, and that\u2019s fallen off again pretty dramatically with -- which is what happened last financial crisis. I guess, what's your confidence, now that we are sort of modeling this well, as we are -- as we stand today. Obviously, oil is a little better right now, but I guess your confidence and just thoughts on the visibility as we move through this now?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, sure. It\u2019s a great question, and we\u2019ve asked that same question of ourselves, a number of times over the last few months. We are giving this our best shot. And from everything we know in talking with customers, and also quite frankly in listening to some of our peer companies, I believe right now, we got it called right. And we have not assumed any improvement in oil and gas as the year goes on. The levels are low. It\u2019s hard to believe they could get a little bit worse, but we also put a range on our guidance. So and the guidance, just to be very clear, the guidance is balanced both ways, plus and minus. It\u2019s not a conservative estimate. It\u2019s what we really believe is going to happen.","And if things do get a little weaker, we are going to be at the low end of the guidance. If things get to be a little stronger, we are going to be at the high-end of the guidance. So, we think we\u2019ve got it. But predicting the future is not an easy thing to do, but with our best people and our best thought process and it\u2019s fairly consistent with what other companies are saying. The only release that I saw that hinted at improvement in oil and gas, at the latter part of this year was in GE's report. Just about everybody else, at least the ones I listen to, and I don't listen to that many, maybe four or five, we\u2019re predicting pretty much what we\u2019re predicting.","Allison Poliniak","Okay, great. And then, just RD&E on a high level, up 5%. In this kind of environment, does the bar get set higher in terms of what you're investing in? I mean, any change to sort of the process now, in sort of a softer versus stronger market for you?","Frank S. Hermance","It\u2019s, probably the last expense in the Company that we do not like to touch. It\u2019s so critical to our future, in terms of -- as you know the level of technology in our products is quite high. And if you make dramatic cuts in that cost, you are going to hurt yourself. You won\u2019t see it for two or three years, so you could improve the short-term performance of the Company, but not the -- you just don\u2019t want to sacrifice the long-term. So we\u2019ve not made any substantial changes in that number. It\u2019s the same number that we talked about at the beginning of the year, and it\u2019s also up over last year by that 5%. It is a lever that we\u2019d have if things did by any chance get any worse. But again, we don\u2019t anticipate that at this point in time.","Allison Poliniak","Great. Thanks so much.","Frank S. Hermance","You bet, Allison.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of Alembic.","Nick Chen","Hi, guys. This is actually Nick Chen for Matt this morning. Thanks for taking our call. I was hoping that you could just talk a little bit more about total and organic orders, in terms of the backlog, and what we are seeing for book and bill?","Frank S. Hermance","Sure. Book and bill in the quarter was 1.02. Orders overall, were up 3%. Organically, they were down 8%.","Nick Chen","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much. And then, just finally, can you talk a little bit about the M&A funnel. And just -- I know you sort of got into a little bit earlier, but just sort of your thoughts on the ability to deploy meaningful capital in regard to the balance sheet of 2016?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, we feel real good. There is a high likelihood that we are going to be able to deploy a sizably larger amount of capital as the year goes on. We have actually beefed up our energy on the acquisition front. We\u2019ve set up a couple other teams within the Company to look at opportunities. We are working with external advisors, and we\u2019ve got a lot that\u2019s in the pipeline. They are varying sizes from the smaller deals like the two we talked about earlier in this meeting to the larger deals. And I would say, it\u2019s probably one of the top priorities of the Company right now. We have got extremely strong cash flow, and we believe that this is the best way for us to create value for our shareholders, while our markets are in a depressed condition.","Nick Chen","That\u2019s great. Thanks so much guys. I will jump back into the queue.","Frank S. Hermance","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets.","Frank S. Hermance","Hello, Matt.","Matthew McConnell","Good morning, guys. Just to touch on the guidance reduction, so $40 million is probably half or a little bit less than half than the guidance reduction, that\u2019s the oil and gas piece. So what \u2026","Frank S. Hermance","No. No, that\u2019s not right.","Matthew McConnell","What\u2019s that?","Frank S. Hermance","No, that\u2019s not right. No, you take $40 million, this is pre-tax, $40 million at the pre-tax level that goes to the bottom line at about $0.12 to $0.13.","Matthew McConnell","Okay. On the revenue side, just going down to flat versus prior outlook for up low single digits, I was figuring -- that\u2019s about $100 million on revenue. And if oil and gas is $40 million, there is another bucket there that got weaker, is that \u2026?","Frank S. Hermance","Oh yes. No, okay. Now I\u2019ve got your question, yes. No, it\u2019s the other part that I was talking about. On the EMG side, with the metal price deflation that I talked about, that\u2019s the other $40 million. So the total is not $100 million, it\u2019s about $80 million.","Matthew McConnell","Okay.","Frank S. Hermance","The contribution margins are a bit different between those two $40 million. That\u2019s actually higher on the oil and gas businesses, and a bit lower than the 50% number that I was using in EMIP. So you take the $80 million times the 0.5 you get basically $40 million of pre-tax. And that\u2019s what I thought your original question was, and that\u2019s how you get to the $0.12 to $0.13 number.","Matthew McConnell","Okay, great.","Frank S. Hermance","Does that help?","Matthew McConnell","Yes, it does. I\u2019m thinking more along the lines of strictly end market weakness and top line weakness, what changed since February? And just getting at what might have gotten worse, besides oil and gas but \u2026?","Frank S. Hermance","Well, it is what I said in response to Brian, is that also the metals deflation in EMIP was deeper than we had anticipated, and it\u2019s also slower coming back. Now we\u2019re seeing a trend where it\u2019s starting to come back. But it\u2019s not coming back at a rate that we think could achieve the original guidance. And that\u2019s why we also reduced that part of the Company by the $40 million. So it\u2019s a double hit. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. I mean, it\u2019s pretty simple actually. We got a hit on the oil and gas and EIG, and a hit on EMIP on the metal side, and that\u2019s the core issue of what we are dealing with.","Matthew McConnell","Okay, great. Thank you. And just on the, you mentioned a greater importance put on the operational excellence initiatives, and that\u2019s up a bit, but the contribution would still be less than what you saw last year and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s a realistic expectation, given the incremental effort that you are putting on those [multiple speakers] initiatives?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. Let\u2019s -- yes, right. If you remember last year was -- and we said it when it happened, it was an exceptional year. We did several restructurings last year. One in the first quarter of 2015 and another one later in the year. So yes, that number last year was bigger, but I hope we set the expectation that was not the run rate. And what we are doing now at $130 million level, we think it\u2019s pretty darn good, and we feel great about it. And it comes back to one of the original or initial questions that, you don\u2019t want to destroy these businesses. These are phenomenal businesses, and you don\u2019t want to go in and take so much cost out, that you then will not be able to recoup. So we think we\u2019ve done the appropriate amount, we are pleased with it. You can see it in the overall performance of the Company. And we are talking about earnings being down here, if you take the average of our estimates about 3%. So, it\u2019s not like we are going to be down 10% or 15% on earnings. So we are actually pretty happy with that, although I know it\u2019s not good from the change in guidance viewpoint.","Matthew McConnell","Yes. Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Frank S. Hermance","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","Hi. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance","Hello, Scott.","Scott Graham","Hey, Frank. I wanted to maybe slice this organic sales question a little bit differently. If we were to maybe pull out oil and gas and EMIP, it looks to me like your organic still would have been down, let\u2019s call it 4% to certainly 5%, which is a third deterioration in the last three quarters, which of course includes those numbers as well. But the point, of course, is that the $80 million if you straight line it, it\u2019s still kind of looks like organic was weaker than certainly I\u2019d have expected. And so, I guess, my question is, one of your four operational model points, legs of the chair, if you will, is in fact new products. And had there been thought given to maybe finding a way to bump up the cost reduction target a little bit more to let\u2019s say fund a little bit more organic growth? Because there has got to be some reason why that the organic has been kind of stubbornly weak for really six quarters now. So I was just wondering what you were thinking about terms of your model, tweaking it to promote more organic?","Frank S. Hermance","Well, I mean, you look basically at our strategies and clearly RD&E and global and market expansion are definitely focused on the organic growth side of the business. If you look at the organic growth of AMETEK, and Kevin has done this analysis over the last -- almost any period you pick, say a year, three years, five years, and I think he even had a 10 year chart, our organic growth lines up quite well with our peers. But obviously when you\u2019ve got the impact of these two market conditions that I\u2019m talking about, it\u2019s not -- just not -- you can\u2019t overcome that is basically what happens. Your number, if you really look at it, isn\u2019t as significant as you think. It\u2019s not a 4% to 5%. It\u2019s a lower number than that. But it\u2019s running slightly negative I\u2019d say, for the rest of the Company, and that\u2019s what\u2019s in our guidance.","But the overwhelming impact is really from those two areas, and that will change when those markets change. So in terms of tweaking the model, yes, we do that all the time. And as I mentioned to Allison\u2019s question, that\u2019s why we are keeping the RD&E expense up, when the top line is weak. And sure we are doing everything we can, to help the organic growth picture of the Company. And we are continuing to invest in higher growth regions of the world, and those are really the two key drivers to the organic side of the question.","Scott Graham","Got it. Thank you, Frank. And I was wondering, if you could do your typical across the business divisions\u2019 summary for us?","Frank S. Hermance","Sure, Scott. I\u2019d be glad to do that. So, let me start with EIG. EIG aerospace sales were down low single digits against a difficult comparison in last year\u2019s first quarter. We had very good growth in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket business in the quarter. But it was offset by a difficult comparison in our business and regional jet business, which you may recall was very, very strong last year. For all of 2016, we expect EIG aerospace sales to be up low to mid single digits, again driven by strength in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket businesses.","Our process businesses, organic sales and process were down about 10% in the quarter, reflecting obviously what we\u2019ve talked about in terms of greater than expected weakness in our oil and gas business. And as I mentioned, while some of the incremental weakness was in our upstream business, project delays and push outs also impacted our mid and downstream business. And as a result, for all of 2016, we now expect sales for our process businesses to be down mid single digits organically. And the last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. There we had a solid first quarter.","Overall, sales were up 10% driven by the contributions from the acquisitions of ESP\/SurgeX and Brookfield that I talked about in my opening comments. Our organic sales were down low single digits. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down a mid single-digit number. So if you sum that all up for EIG, we are expecting overall sales to be roughly flat. And that\u2019s obviously driven by the acquisitions of Surface Vision, Brookfield and ESP\/SurgeX with organic sales down to the mid single-digit kind of region. Moving to the other half of the Company, Scott, in EMG and the differentiated side, organic sales for our differentiated business were down high single digits versus the first quarter of 2015, driven largely by weakness across our Engineered Materials Interconnects & Packaging business.","And the weakness, as I\u2019ve already indicated, was really due to the impact of commodity price deflation. However, here we do expect sequential improvements over the rest of 2016, and we are really basing that on current order trends which have strengthened, and thus we really do expect a stronger second half than first half. So if you sum all of that up for the differentiated piece, for all of 2016, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses organic sales to be roughly flat versus the prior year. And the last and now much smaller part of our Company, Floorcare & Specialty Motors, they were also down approximately 10% in the first quarter as a result of softer global market conditions.","And for 2016, we expect sales for this business to be roughly flat organically versus prior year. You take those two parts of EMG, so overall then for EMG we expect overall sales and organic growth to be roughly flat versus 2015. And then lastly, obviously, you sum EIG and EMG, and that\u2019s where we get to the flat overall sales, and organic sales down the low to mid single digits on a percentage basis.","Scott Graham","Thank you, Frank.","Frank S. Hermance","Hey, you bet, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone.","Frank S. Hermance","Hi, Robert.","Robert McCarthy","So, a couple questions here. I mean one question that\u2019s come up from an investor is just thinking about and maybe drilling down on this question about the size of deal. I think investors have been concerned about perhaps in the context of a lower structural organic growth and some of the challenges there, that doing a larger deal is kind of a priority, just given the law of large numbers. And could you just talk about your capacity to do a deal now, of what size, and then ultimately how you think about your funnel? I know you did allude in previous comments, how you are looking at a variety of deals. And then, clearly there is a priority, all things being equal to do a larger deal. But could you just talk about that, particularly, in the context of -- I do think you brought up your revolver and your leverage a little bit this quarter. So, could we get a sense of what is kind of the outward bound of your capacity right now?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, sure. You\u2019ve got a bunch of questions in there. Let me start with what we consider a larger deal. First of all, we\u2019re not looking at mergers of equals here. If you look at most merger of equals, they don\u2019t create shareholder value. So, when we look at the size of deal that we\u2019re focused on, it\u2019s really between in volume between $50 million and a couple of $100 million. And if a larger deal comes along, up in the $400 million or $500 million region, we\u2019d consider doing that. In order to meet the model that we\u2019ve discussed with you, where we basically want to achieve on a yearly basis -- it\u2019s not going to be every year, but on average 5% to 10% of our sales coming from acquisitions, that\u2019s the basic model we\u2019ve talked about for years.","You take the upper end of that and its $400 million. We are $4 billion right now, so you take the upper end of 10%, you need to do $400 million in volume. And there is different ways you can say, what\u2019s the purchase price based on that, but you take $400 million and multiply that by maybe 1.2 or 2, say 2, just to make the numbers easy, you got to deploy $800 million a year in capital on average to make -- to get to the high-end of that range. What\u2019s our capacity? Right now our capacity is -- with everything we\u2019ve got, we\u2019re well in excess of $900 million in capacity. But more important than that, if you look at the free cash flow of the Company, the operating cash flow is going to be this year, on the order of $775 million, which means the free cash flow, we\u2019ve our CapEx set around $70 million, is around $700 million. So -- and when you buy companies, you get an EBITDA stream.","So, basically we could easily deploy $1 billion plus, probably a $1.3 billion. I haven\u2019t run the numbers recently without affecting significantly the leverage of the Company. We will remain investment grade. That\u2019s absolutely our thrust. We don\u2019t intend to float equity. We don\u2019t need to based on the numbers that I just told you. So we are in a great position. Now if you look at it from the viewpoint of capacity, from a management viewpoint, the way we\u2019ve put the -- made changes in the Company really over the last number of years is to basically put enough resource in the Company, which is already there now, it\u2019s already done. So, that we could handle three deals a year or three deals simultaneously, excuse me.","And if you take on average how long it takes to do a deal, it means you could easily do 10 deals a year, probably even do a few more than that. The key point is we don\u2019t have to do that larger deal. We can get to that $400 million number by doing a bunch of smaller deals. But on the other hand, if we can find something, and we\u2019ve looked at a few and we are actually very close on one or few quarters ago that we talked about, that\u2019s larger we will do that. So we are not management constrained. We are not financially constrained from a cash flow viewpoint, and it just comes down to finding really good companies. And we\u2019ve got a lot of effort going in, and the backlog is good.","We are looking at deals. I can tell you that Dave and I are involved in deals on a daily basis. And I can\u2019t tell you exactly when the next one is going to close, but I can tell you that we are fairly optimistic that we are going do well. And that\u2019s the best way that we can take the strong cash flow of the Company, and create value for you. So I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve answered all of your questions. I tried to bundle them altogether, but did that get at them?","Robert McCarthy","That\u2019s encyclopediac. Thank you for the full response and for the audience, we didn\u2019t collude on that question, because it was a very well scripted response. In terms of two other points, one on restructuring, I mean, do you think we will continued to see call outs here going forward or just given, I mean, how do you think about the sense that what\u2019s ongoing and what should be just built into your earnings base, just cost of doing business, [indiscernible] what you do versus [indiscernible] fortune?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, that\u2019s -- we think of this number of -- I will call it a $100 million plus. We are at $130 million now. That\u2019s what we think we can do on a year in year out basis. We\u2019ve put the infrastructure in the Company to do that and we believe that can continue for a substantial amount of time. And the majority of that is sort of built into our revenue and our guidance, as we give it to you guys and ladies. And the reason for that is the structure that we\u2019ve put in place.","As you know we\u2019re an operationally focused Company. So, in terms of just our normal operational excellence strategies, we can get $50 million to $70 million a year. And in terms of our materials strategy, we are in that same ballpark, and therefore, that\u2019s an ongoing cost. In terms of any, what I would call major restructuring of the Company, no. We are not envisioning that, and we\u2019ve to modify these strategies as time goes on. And I will give you an example and Dave maybe you can speak to this, that on the material side, we had to change the strategy a bit and we\u2019ve done it incrementally over the last number of years and we\u2019ve added a value analysis tool into our toolbox. And Dave, why don\u2019t you speak to that a little bit? You\u2019ve really led that activity and done a great job with it.","David A. Zapico","Sure. It really comes down to getting that $50 million a year of cost savings that you talked about. And for some of our maturer businesses, where we\u2019ve already globalized the supply chain, we really focused on charting the bill material from an engineering viewpoint. So, we\u2019ve taken our bill of materials focused on the highest cost items and used both our engineering capability and supply chain capability to attack that, and very quickly go through projects than we are introducing cost out designs in a matter of three or six months. And we\u2019ve done that across the Company, and we\u2019ve institutionalized it as one of our operational excellence tools. And that was the largest driver of our material cost savings.","So, if you think about we bring a new company in, we go after the supply chain hard and we get big savings. We often can take 25% out of the company\u2019s material costs, because of our global sourcing. Well, if we owned the company for 5 or 10 years, we\u2019ve to find other avenues to take material costs out and that\u2019s where the value analysis, value engineering comes in, and now let\u2019s institutionalize across the whole business. And as I mentioned, it\u2019s the largest driver of the material costs now. So we are very happy about that.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks for your time.","Frank S. Hermance","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra of Jefferies.","Bhupender Bohra","Hey, good morning, guys.","David A. Zapico","Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance","Good morning.","Bhupender Bohra","My question, Frank, if you can give us some color on the BRIC countries, the global [technical difficulty] especially China. What you assume \u2026","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, yes. Good news and bad news is the best way to say it. Overall, BRIC countries organically were down 8% and China was the driver down about 9%. If you look at the other countries, Russia continues to be weak, Brazil weak, but actually a little bit better than it was doing in terms of decremental organic growth versus last year. But obviously, the driver here is China and I should mention India is good. That\u2019s the one that was good last quarter and it remains good. We had mid single-digit kind of organic growth in India. ","The good news is that we are feeling a stabilization in China. And if you look at the numbers we\u2019ve provided over the last three quarters on China, they are not the best in the world, but the key thing is the orders in the first quarter were flat organically. So -- and in talking with our people there, they\u2019re feeling a bit of stabilization, I would say, is probably the best word. So we are feeling a little bit better about China, but obviously, the BRIC countries, which for a while for us were growing at 25%, 30% overall are now more of a challenge. But hopefully, what we saw in orders in China is an indication that things are going to get better there.","Bhupender Bohra","Okay. So just a follow-on, on the energy business here. You talked about the shortfall of $40 million. Can you give us some color into upstream, the midstream, and the downstream portion? And where did you \u2026?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, basically if you look at -- you are talking about the incremental $40 million that I talked about. It was evenly split between downstream at about $20 million and the combination of upstream and downstream at -- or upstream -- yes, upstream and downstream at $20 million. So, $20 million in upstream, $20 million in the combination of mid and downstream. I don\u2019t think I said that right a moment ago. Okay. And then, between upstream -- between midstream and downstream, it was more downstream oriented.","Bhupender Bohra","Okay.","Frank S. Hermance","Okay.","Bhupender Bohra","And the other $40 million on the metals business, now I thought when we saw the commodity kind of prices jump in February, that your customers would have actually come into buy the metals, but I don\u2019t know what \u2026?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, here -- it\u2019s a great question, absolutely a great question. And the issue is what metals are key to AMETEK? And in our case, the key metals on the EMIP side are molybdenum trioxide, cobalt, vanadium and to a lesser degree nickel. And if you actually look at those three metals, they are down and they have not come back. And that\u2019s why, when they do come back, our customers -- right now, they don\u2019t want to buy when they are very low, right? So, we don\u2019t have an impact on our cost, because we pass basically the price of the raw material on. So we are not sort of -- we don\u2019t have an issue from that viewpoint. The issue from us is when metal prices are very low, our customers are just going to hold off as long as they possibly can and before they start buying, and that\u2019s what\u2019s really happening right now. And it was -- and the fact that those metals have not rebounded yet, is the issue. So you can\u2019t look at us in terms of the standard metals that you think of.","Bhupender Bohra","Okay, right. Thanks a lot.","Frank S. Hermance","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.","Frank S. Hermance","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Glynn","Hey, good morning. So, question on the full-year guide versus the first half. It looks like we are implying a couple points of margin improvement in the second half versus the first. That\u2019s steep, so just wanted to get some thoughts, get my brain around that?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. We feel pretty comfortable as we move through the year in terms of the improvements. And I\u2019m going to talk sort of about the overall improvements in EPS, and there is three drivers for this. The first is that in our process businesses, there is a seasonality impact of several of our non-oil and gas related businesses, where they always have a stronger second half than first half. The second thing is that in one of our oil and gas divisions, thermal process management, they\u2019ve actually won market share with a good share of that improvement from the market share gain viewpoint already in backlog. And they\u2019ve done that really through several initiatives. The first was increased penetration in the Middle East, and also a partnership that we\u2019ve with Pentair.","So, the first factor is, we expect the process businesses to have some improvement because of those factors. The second factor is what we\u2019ve already talked about in terms of EMIP, that we believe that situation, and we are already seeing it in order intake, will have a gradual improvement through the year. And therefore we will see incremental improvements from that volume, and we are very confident in that. And then, the third thing is really the cost improvements.","And if you look at how the cost improvements layer in, they become much more significant in the latter quarters in the year. So you take the organic growth of the first two reasons I outlined, and obviously when that goes to the bottom line, that improves your margins, because of our very high contribution margins. And then, you put these incremental cost improvements through the business. That\u2019s why we feel those margins will in fact improve.","Christopher Glynn","Okay.","Frank S. Hermance","Does that help?","Christopher Glynn","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then, in terms of M&A, I think you did mention a heightened focus on energy related assets, in particular. So, if I heard that correctly, I\u2019m wondering how you match that focus up against, maybe gauging the risk of a commodities super cycle that could be a mirror image of a 10-year emerging markets boom?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, our focus is to fundamentally buy good businesses. We\u2019re not afraid of buying a business, when it\u2019s in a down cycle. We believe oil and gas is going to be a good place to play on the longer term, and we\u2019re in a substantial down cycle. Now is oil going to get back to $125 a barrel? No, I don\u2019t think so. But I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that it\u2019s going to get back to a healthier level, so we\u2019re not afraid to buy assets. And you can get extremely -- potentially extremely good pricing, because you\u2019ve got businesses in distress and -- but it\u2019s not, I wouldn\u2019t say, we are focused on oil and gas, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve said that. I just said, we -- we are not afraid to buy a business in a down cycle.","Actually, you\u2019ve there almost a reverse problem. If you are in a very strong up cycle, and you look at the sellers who are selling that business, they of course will take where they\u2019re at the top of the cycle, and say they\u2019re going to grow organically from that point, and they will never put a cycle -- down cycle in their estimates. So, you got to be careful on that side of the equation.","So, we always put cycles in our acquisition models. We actually have an approach, where we can do Monte Carlo analysis and change the magnitude of the cycles, change the timing of the cycles, et cetera, so that we make sure we are paying the correct amount for the assets.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And I know it\u2019s getting late, but last quarter you kind of pushed us to the low-end of the guidance, that proved prescient. Any way we should handicap the current range?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, I mean, that\u2019s a great point. And if you recall, what I said at -- in one of the questions that one somebody asked in this meeting, right around the time we released guidance, I don\u2019t remember exactly when oil hit $26 a barrel, but we were starting to feel that. And so therefore when I came out or we came out with guidance at -- a quarter ago, I pushed you towards the low-end, and I did that, because of the concern that did in fact materialize. I\u2019m not sure; I think I\u2019ve ever done that before in my 16 years of being a CEO.","Normally we come out with a very balanced view on the guidance, not trying to push it one way or the other. And as I\u2019ve already mentioned on this call, the guidance we are giving you now is balanced. In other words, we think there is as much upside potential, as there is downside risk. So, if things are weaker than what I\u2019m saying, you could end up at the low-end. If things are better, you are going to be at the high-end. So it\u2019s a balanced view and it\u2019s not weighted in either direction. And so, which is much more consistent with what we\u2019ve done in the past.","Christopher Glynn","Sounds good. Thanks.","Frank S. Hermance","All right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Frank, I just want to clarify, did you mention earlier, in the Floorcare business, you mentioned down 10% organic in the first quarter and then expectation of flat for the full-year.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes.","Joe Giordano","So can you kind of talk us through where -- how you are getting to bridging that?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. That\u2019s real simple. The second half of the year, last year was very weak. So the comp [indiscernible] easier.","Joe Giordano","Okay, easy enough. And then a question on the guidance. Just I know we\u2019ve talked about this a lot, but when you gave your initial guidance, and you were pointing us to the low end, were you contemplating like a second half appreciation in underlying markets that just didn\u2019t materialize or \u2026?","Frank S. Hermance","No, it\u2019s the reverse \u2026","Joe Giordano","[Multiple speakers] further.","Frank S. Hermance","No, it\u2019s the reverse. It\u2019s really what I talked about in answer to the first question. It\u2019s that oil and gas and the impact of metals deflation got worse. And I was feeling that around the time of the call, but we were unable to quantify it, because the market -- both of those markets sort of just clammed up, is what happened.","Joe Giordano","Yes, So both guidance kind of \u2026.","Frank S. Hermance","I did the best I could to try to give you the best call I could give you, with what I knew at the time. [Multiple speakers] guidance. I mean, we did make our guidance so.","Joe Giordano","Right. So, but it\u2019s fair to say that both guidances had a flat trajectory from point A, it\u2019s just it\u2019s a lower starting point now?","Frank S. Hermance","I think that\u2019s fair.","Joe Giordano","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Frank S. Hermance","I think that\u2019s fair, yes.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Good morning, guys.","Frank S. Hermance","Hello, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","You\u2019ve covered a lot of ground so, and certainly \u2026","Frank S. Hermance","That\u2019s for sure.","Nigel Coe","A couple quick ones. So, you took up your revolver in mid March from $700 million to $850 million \u2026","Frank S. Hermance","Yes.","Nigel Coe","\u2026 and is that a signal of maybe size potential, maybe you need to see in the M&A backlog or was it -- am I just reading too much into that?","Frank S. Hermance","Well, there is a couple factors and that was surely one of them, that we have a lot of banks who are willing to give us a lot of funding. So, we took advantage of that. But also you don\u2019t like the term of your revolver to get near the end. You\u2019ve better negotiating power when you\u2019re not at the end, and so that also entered into this. And there are some signals that at some point in the future, interest rates are going to go up. So you are just in a better negotiating position. So that\u2019s -- I mean, really those two factors that drove it. Bob, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add?","Robert R. Mandos","No, I totally agree with what you said, Frank.","Frank S. Hermance","All right.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great. And the message on M&A is obviously very clear, but the stock price is down this morning. Is there any bias towards buying back stock at these levels versus M&A?","Frank S. Hermance","The bias is definitely towards M&A. I mean, we\u2019ve said and said repeatedly that the best way we create value for our shareholders is by buying companies and making them better, and that is the primary use of capital. Having said that, we will do opportunistic buybacks of stock. And I think Bob mentioned in his report that in the first quarter we did some. It was 2.4 million shares and we may very well continue that, but I don\u2019t want to imply that that\u2019s going to be a primary use of our cash. We can create better value for you, by buying companies and improving them.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Very clear, Frank. Thanks.","Frank S. Hermance","Okay, Nigel.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the floor back over to the presenters for the closing remarks.","Frank S. Hermance","Great. Thank you very much, Jenisha. Thanks everyone for joining the call today. A replay will be available on AMETEK.com and StreetEvents.com,. And as always, I\u2019m available for further discussions today. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect."],"2262":["AMETEK, Inc.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Coleman, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please begin.","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Latoya. Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me this morning are Dave Zapico, Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","AMETEK's first quarter results were released earlier this morning and are available electronically on market systems and on our website in the Investors section of ametek.com.

Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. AMETEK had an excellent first quarter. We delivered strong sales growth and solid operating results with earnings that were above our guidance range. We continue to generate strong levels of cash flow which we are successfully deploying on highly strategic acquisitions. We're also seeing the benefits of the ongoing growth investments we are making across our businesses and geographies. While these quarterly results reflect the benefits of a modestly improving macro environment, they also reflect the strength of AMETEK's business model and the execution of our growth strategies.","Now on to the financial highlights for the quarter. Please note that any references on this call to full year 2016 financial results will be on an adjusted basis excluding the fourth quarter 2016 adjustments. Sales in the first quarter were $1.01 billion, up 7% versus the first quarter of 2016. Organic sales were up 4%. Acquisitions added 4% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind in the quarter. We're very pleased that we've returned to positive organic growth one quarter earlier than we had anticipated. And we're equally encouraged by the broad based improvements in sales during the quarter. In addition to the strength in sales, we saw excellent growth in orders in the quarter with overall orders up 16% and organic orders up 9%. This order strength was also broad based.","Operating income in the quarter was $220.3 million, up 6% from the same period in 2016 and operating income margin was 21.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60, an increase of 5% compared to last year's first quarter of $0.57 per share. Operating cash flow was excellent at $193 million, up 27% over the prior year excluding a pension contribution made in this year's first quarter.","Now turning to the individual operating groups. Firstly, Electronic Instruments Group. Our Electronic Instruments Group performed very well in the first quarter with strong sales and operating performance. In the quarter, EIG reported sales of $619.8 million, up 9% compared to the same quarter in 2016. Organic sales were up 4%. Acquisitions contributed 6% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. Organic growth was fairly broad based with particular strength in many of our process and power businesses. Sales for oil and gas businesses were roughly flat in the quarter and in line with our expectations. Acquisition growth was also strong as a result of the five acquisitions we have completed within EIG over the last year, including Brookfield, ESP\/SurgeX, Nu Instruments, HS Foils and Rauland-Borg.","EIG operating income increased 10% to $156.7 million and our operating margins were a very strong 25.3%, up 40 basis points over last year's first quarter.","The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $387.9 million, up 3% versus the first quarter of 2016 with organic sales up 4% versus the prior year. The acquisition of Laserage contributed 1% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind for the quarter.","We saw solid growth across our Precision Motion Control and Floorcare and Specialty Motors businesses as well as stable conditions across our Engineered Materials Interconnects & Packaging businesses in the quarter. EMG operating margins in the first quarter were $79.4 million with solid operating margins at 20.5%. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong sales, orders and operating results in the first quarter.","In addition, we continue to be pleased with the success of our acquisition efforts. In February we acquired Rauland-Borg, one of the largest acquisitions. And in April, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire MOCON. I will provide a brief overview on each of these businesses.","First, Rauland-Borg. Rauland is a leading global provider of mission critical clinical communications and workflow solutions to hospitals, healthcare systems and post-acute care facilities. Rauland also provides communication solutions to educational facilities. We see attractive incremental growth opportunities for Rauland by increasing their market share in international markets, expanding through additional acquisition opportunities, and through leveraging our operational excellence capabilities. Rauland adds approximately $160 million in sales. The purchase price was $340 million plus a potential contingent payment of $30 million tied to achievement of certain milestones. The integration is going very well and the Rauland team has hit the ground running and is delivering strong performance. We're very excited about the excellent growth opportunity Rauland provides AMETEK.","On April 17, we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire all the outstanding common stock of MOCON, Inc. at a price of $30 per share. The aggregate enterprise value of the transaction is approximately $182 million. MOCON is a leading provider of laboratory and field gas analysis instrumentation to research laboratories, production facilities and quality control departments in food and beverage, pharmaceutical and industrial applications.","This is an excellent acquisition for AMETEK as MOCON's products and technologies nicely complement our existing gas analysis instrumentation business. In addition, they provide us with opportunities to expand our gas analysis instrumentation presence in the growing food and pharmaceutical packaging test market where MOCON is the global leader.","The company is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of MOCON shareholders and applicable regulatory approvals. We expect the transaction to close in the late second quarter or early third quarter.","We are very excited about our recent acquisitions as they provide us the opportunity to expand our businesses into new adjacent market segments with strong growth characteristics. These acquisitions also provide us the opportunity to drive meaningful cost synergy through the integration into our global infrastructure and to our operational excellence program. Lastly, these acquisitions will provide us the opportunity to better target and service customers by leveraging products and technologies across all of AMETEK.","One example of this sales leverage can be found in a recent $24 million multi-year contract award to AMETEK in support of a large automated test equipment program for a U.S. defense contractor. Two of our businesses, VTI Instruments which we acquired in 2014 and Programmable Power, successfully partnered to help win the award. Both businesses are part of our broader Power Systems and Instruments business and provide test and measurement solutions for a wide range of critical applications. One of the main drivers for the selection was the combined capability of VTI and Programmable Power. Along with this technical capability, the customer has the advantage of a streamlined interface for service, sales support and program management. This is a great example of the sales synergies we develop across our businesses through our acquisition integration process.","We are seeing great results from our continued investments in research, development and engineering to support our differentiated products in the niche markets they serve. These RD&E investments play a key role enhancing organic growth. In 2017, we expect to increase our investments in RD&E to approximately $220 million or roughly 5% of sales. This is an increase of approximately 10% over 2016 RD&E spend levels. Our vitality index remained very strong at 23% of sales in the first quarter.","One new product example this year is the Flex 4K-GS model high-speed camera from our Vision Research business. The high-speed 35-millimeter 9.4 megapixel camera employs a custom sensor capable of recording 1,000 frames per second at 4K resolution. This camera was designed for demanding application in the scientific research, defense and aerospace industries. The camera's design is critical to the defense industry as its isolated electronics and the thermal design allow the camera to operate in environments that range in temperature from minus 20 degrees C to plus 50 degrees C, all while maintaining excellent image quality.","We are also seeing continued great results from the execution of a broad set of operational excellence initiatives. Through these OpEx initiatives, we expect to drive approximately $100 million in savings in 2017. Equally important to these savings is the positive impact these operational excellence tools have on our working capital and cash flow generation. We delivered excellent working capital and generated strong levels of cash flow in the first quarter. This strong cash flow provides us the opportunity to support growth investments back into our businesses while providing significant capital for us to deploy in our strategic acquisitions.","In addition, we are making excellent progress on expanding and enhancing our operational excellence tools on the sales and marketing processes within our businesses to support improved organic growth.","Now turning to the outlook for 2017. Please note that our guidance for 2017 does not include the pending MOCON acquisition. We view the first quarter's results as a positive sign that market conditions are improving and we are encouraged by the organic growth in sales and orders during the quarter.","For all of 2017, we expect overall sales will be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2016 with organic sales up low-single digits. We have increased our earnings guidance range for 2017 to $2.40 to $2.48 per diluted share from our prior guidance of $2.34 to $2.46, an increase of $0.04 at the midpoint. Our current guidance range implies earnings growth of 4% to 8% over adjusted 2016 earnings.","For the second quarter of 2017, we are expecting overall sales to be up mid-single digits with organic sales up low-single digits. We are anticipating second quarter diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62.","To summarize, we delivered a very strong quarter with a high quality of earnings and are well positioned for solid earnings growth in 2017. We continue managing our businesses prudently in the short term while also making appropriate investments to support long-term growth. Our talented and experienced management team will continue to leverage our growth strategies to drive growth across our businesses.","The company's balance sheet is strong, supported by our outstanding cash flow generation. We will use this financial capacity to compound future performance through niche differentiated acquisitions which we can significantly improve. We are excited for the year ahead.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I would like to thank all of our AMETEK employees for their continued exceptional work. We have a tremendously talented and dedicated team and greatly appreciate all their efforts in delivering strong results in the quarter while working to properly position AMETEK for a strong long-term growth.","I will now turn it over to, Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter and the year. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, we had a very strong first quarter with results that exceeded our expectations. Let me provide some financial highlights.","In the first quarter, organic selling expenses were up in line with organic sales growth. General and administrative expenses were up over last year's first quarter due largely to higher compensation expense. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 27.4% versus last year's first quarter rate of 26.7%, and in line with our expectations.","For 2017, we expect our tax rate to be between 27% and 28%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 18.4% of sales in the quarter, down from 20.8% in last year's first quarter.","Capital expenditures were $13 million for the quarter and we expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $75 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $43 million in the quarter. For the full year 2017, depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $180 million. In the first quarter, we made a $50 million contribution to our U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans. Excluding this contribution, operating cash flow in the first quarter was excellent at $193 million, up 27% from the first quarter of 2016 and free cash flow was $179 million or 129% of net income.","For the full year, excluding the $50 million pension contribution, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 125% of net income. The primary use of our excellent free cash flow was to support our acquisition strategy, and as Dave mentioned, we have been very active on this front. Following a strong year for acquisitions in 2016, we deployed $340 million on the acquisition of Rauland-Borg in the first quarter, and in April, we announced a merger agreement to acquire MOCON.","Total debt at March 31 was $2.41 billion, up from $2.34 billion at December 31, 2016. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $570 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at March 31 of 35%. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.6 billion of cash and existing credit lines to support our growth initiatives.","In summary, we delivered excellent results in the first quarter with a high quality of earnings. We are well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Great, thanks, Bill. Latoya, we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from Bhupender Bohra of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning guys.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Yes, just wanted to get a sense of, as you've kept your 2017 organic sales guidance up low single digits which is kind of unchanged, how are you thinking about your oil and gas and metals businesses here \u2013 the previous expectation was kind of flat for the year, any change to that guidance or expectation as we go into the remainder of the year? Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. The oil and gas market played out as expected. It was roughly flat in the first quarter. The interesting point and the positive point is orders inflected up mid-single digits. So while we were flat, our orders inflected up to mid-single digits and it was driven by upstream, and some of the project business in the Middle East.","So we continue to expect roughly flat sales for oil and gas for the year. We really like the trends we're seeing, but we want to remain a bit conservative at this point. And we realize, we're about 20% exposed to the upstream and 80% to the mid and downstream. So we're expecting the mid and upstream \u2013 the mid and downstream to inflect up later in the year or next year. But we do see positive order results in the first quarter related to the project business in the Middle East. So it played out as expected and flat in the first quarter but were positive on the orders inflecting up to mid-single digits.","The metals story is really pretty much the same, played out as expected in the first quarter. Like oil and gas, orders were up mid single-digits so that's positive. We continue to expect roughly flat sales for our EMIP business for the year, but we like the trends we're seeing, but we want to maintain a bit of conservatism at this point.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Got it.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Does that answer your question?","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Yes, you did. Just one more follow-up on here. If I'm looking at the PMI, the export indices, that's been pretty strong over the last few months here despite the strength in the U.S. dollar. Can you talk about like AMETEK's exports market like where are you seeing strength especially region-wise and maybe some color from product-wise perspective? Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, 52% of our sales are international and we saw strong international growth in the quarter. Europe was up 7% organically, so a definite improvement from the recent trends. The Process businesses and our Dunkermotoren business were particularly strong. And Asia was up double digits organically driven by strength in our analytical instruments businesses. China was up high-single digit in sales and Japan was also strong, was up 30% tied to the Japanese government fiscal year-end. So we saw really strong growth in Asia, strong growth in Europe. So we're seeing broad-based international growth.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And can you point to like what was the growth in the USA or North America?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes. Sure. In the U.S., we saw a continued improvement from prior quarters. You remember, we saw sequential improvement in the U.S., and in Q1, it was flat on sales. So U.S. was flat but the orders growth was solid in the U.S. It was up mid-single digits. So across the board in all geographies, recent trends in all regions were up and we feel really good about it.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Thanks a lot.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Summerville of Alembic Global. Your line is open.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Thanks, good morning. Just a question about mix. Can you talk about why, if I'm calculating it correctly, incremental margins on a 4% organic increase were only 19% in the quarter? I would imagine there are some acquisition-related items, whether it'd be inventory step-up for Rauland-Borg, some of the diligence costs for MOCON. So can you flesh that all out?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes, right, Matt. When you look at Q1, actually our operating income margins were up 20 basis points on a core basis and we had 40 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions. So actually, the year-over-year Q1 incrementals were a healthy 32%. So we feel real good about that.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. And then you mentioned I think, Dave, in your prepared remarks, you anticipate yielding $100 million worth of cost savings this year. Can you maybe break that down into the various buckets to get you there and where you can see upside to that number as you progress throughout the remainder of the year? Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. Yes. We're off to a good start in our cost savings, right on plan. $60 million of that cost savings comes from material cost reductions and $40 million comes from other than material cost reductions, and about $16 million of that comes from the realignment charges that we took in Q4. And we feel that we've got an excellent plan to take cost out of the business, to make the business more efficient, and we're right on plan on executing it.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Thanks, Dave.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brett Linzey of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning everyone.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just wanted to touch on price, cost. Could you maybe just talk about price specifically in the quarter and if you can maybe just separate the metals business versus some of the core industrial businesses? And then on the cost side, did you see any incentive comp accrual or anything moving against that in the quarter? And then what are the expectations for the full year?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes, great questions. We saw incentive comp accrual, our G&A was up a bit in the quarter. And you recall that in the last call, we highlighted low incentive comp payouts in 2016 related to our performance, and we reset that for the year's plan, but now we're a bit of ahead of our plan, so we have some additional headwinds there. So it was a $0.05 headwinds for the year prior to the quarter and now it's a bit more and you see that working through the G&A line with the increase in G&A vast majority was driven by compensation expense.","And the other question was related to price. Price was about 1% in the quarter and that's across all of AMETEK and our total inflation was about 1%. So we offset total inflation with price, and for the year, we're expecting to increase the price a little bit. We have about 1.5 points of price in our plan, and we think inflation may increase a bit through the year, so we want to stay ahead of that but we're not seeing it right now. And in the first quarter, price was a point and it offset inflation.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. And then if we just aggregate the 2017 acquisitions you've made and as well as the 2016 deals with the stub contribution this year, what's the net EPS accretion you're assuming for this year? And then I guess as we look into 2018 and some of the one-time PPA dates (25:40) what's the run rate accretion for 2018 for the first full year?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, I think working in the number for 2017 is a $0.04 or $0.05 number. And in 2018, that'll be a bit more than that but we're not in 2018 yet.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, all right, great. Thanks, guys.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a strong start to the year.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Rob.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Maybe we can just first just talk about kind of the state of play of the balance sheet, the capital deployment environment. I mean there has been some articles that would suggest given kind of this looming kind of regulatory and political uncertainty that actually M&A's slowed. And obviously, valuations don't help that because valuations continue to go up and up. And in an uncertain environment, the bid-ask can be distorted. But could you talk about you think your ability over the next 12 to 18 months, 12 to 24 months to kind of live up to your potential in terms of capital deployment and then talk about some of the opportunities you see?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes. Our balance sheet remains strong. We currently have $1 billion plus in firepower after MOCON and the pipeline remains very strong and active. And as you know, with our niche strategy, we have a dedicated team of M&A and deal sourcing professionals who work closely with our businesses to manage and cultivate the deal pipeline. So, AMETEK we buy in up cycles, we buy in down cycles, we buy in uncertain environments and we're very active. And right now our pipeline remains very strong and like to deploy more capital this year. We got off to a great start with the Rauland deal. And MOCON, if that deal closes as we expect, we'll deploy $522 million in the first two quarters of the year, so we're well on our way in our plan of deploying our free cash flow on value-enhancing acquisitions.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then as most people saw my work know that I just steal, so I'm going to steal Scott Graham's kind of state of the end markets and segments from him, all right, see he goes for that.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure. I'll start with aerospace. Our overall aerospace sales were down slightly in the quarter as we had expected. Strength in our commercial OEM business and business and regional jet businesses were offset by lower sales in our military business due to the timing of program shipments. For all of 2017, we continue to expect overall aerospace business to be up low single to mid-single digits with growth across each of our segments.","Moving to Process, our Process businesses performed very well in the quarter with strong sales and orders growth. Overall, sales were up mid-teens driven by mid-single-digit organic growth and the contributions from the acquisitions of Rauland-Borg and Nu Instruments. Both sales and orders growth in the quarter were broad-based across most of our Process businesses. Sales for our oil and gas business, as we already mentioned, were flat in the quarter with solid mid-single-digit orders growth. While we're encouraged by the solid growth in the quarter, we continue to expect organic sales for Process to be up low single digits for the full year.","Moving to power and industrial, overall sales for our power and industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter, driven by contributions from the acquisitions of Brookfield Engineering, ESP\/SurgeX and from low single-digit organic growth. Solid organic growth in our power business was offset by weaker conditions across our heavy truck business, and for all of 2017, we now expect organic sales for power and industrial to be up low single digits.","Differentiated EMG businesses organic sales were up low single digits in the quarter, driven by solid growth in our Precision Motion Control business. Sales for our EMIP business, as we mentioned prior, were flat, but we had solid mid-single-digit order growth. For all of 2017, we continue to expect organic sales for all of differentiated EMG to be up low single digits versus 2016.","And finally, our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business, organic sales in Floorcare and Specialty Motors were up mid-single digits in the quarter. And for 2017, we now expect sales for this business to be up low- to mid-single digits organically.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Rob.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, this is Jeff Reive on for Deane Dray. I just had a question about your Rauland-Borg acquisition. I know it's still pretty early, but what kind of strides have been made for international growth? I know that was one of the big pieces behind adding value at AMETEK.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. We've made a lot of progress at Rauland in integrating the business into AMETEK. They came out of the gate strong, very active in the integration processes. We have teams working on international growth. We have some kaizen events scheduled later this quarter to get after some of it. So everything that we see there, we're more confident than ever that we're going to be able to increase international sales as part of our investment thesis in Rauland.","Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, that's great. And then just a quick update on just the trend of order flow. Can you just kind of discuss how it progressed through the quarter and now that we're into May, what the trend's been across AMETEK as a whole?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","In Q1, January started off much as we anticipated and then in February and March, it trended upward and it was stronger than we anticipated and it was broad-based, as I mentioned before. And we just finished April and April orders are right in line with what we thought we'd be to deliver our Q2 plan.","Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Great, thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning. The free cash flow guidance, 125% conversion excluding the contribution, that's a little bit of a higher conversion rate than you've guided in the past, particularly at this time of year. Just wondering what's behind that, if that's a timing thing for this year or if that's kind of the steady-state go forward after the past year or two of incremental deal flow?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, I think steady-state over multiple years, we'd still guide to 120% but you really have a couple of things. One, the working capital performance was absolutely outstanding in the business and our free cash flow conversion was nearly 130% in Q1. So with that, the confidence of that progress we were able to increase the 2017 expectations to 125% conversion. And again, the operations are executing perfectly. They're converting the orders of sales and they're executing on the working capital management, so we're really pleased with that.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just looking for a little disaggregation of orders in terms of by segment growth and the overall book-to-bill?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure. EIG organic in Q1 was 10%. EMG organic in Q1 was 9% and Q1 book-to-bill was 1.11.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Allison.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just want to get back to the orders. Just trying to reconcile and I understand you want to be conservative. Is there a timing in the orders? Are they more for the back half of the year? Do some of that gets pushed into 2018? Is there something that's giving you some concern on those trends that you didn't want to raise organic yet?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Great question. There are some of the orders that are multi-year orders. The $24 million order with a government defense contractor will ship in 2017 and 2018. So we have a little bit of that in the quarter. But fundamentally, we definitely performed better than we expected in Q1. We saw stronger sales, orders and earnings.","We're very pleased with the performance and I'm confident for the rest of the year, but it was one good quarter. And remember, we're just coming out of a 2-year industrial recession. So it feels prudent to be a bit conservative at this point of the year just so we can make sure that our great start is sustainable and we don't get ahead of ourselves.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's great. And then just touching on incrementals, 32% in Q1, is that a sustainable level? Should we look to an inflect up towards the back half of the year? How should we think about those?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Great. We gave guidance that core incrementals would be up 20 basis points to 60 basis points for 2017. So we're still very comfortable with that range.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Scott Graham of BMO Capital. Your line is open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Rob, thank you for asking my question. One less thing to worry about. The two questions that I have are as you exited 2015, you were really on a bit of an acquisition tear, I guess a little bit like you maybe are now. But if my tally is correct, I think over a 4-year period, you added a substantial amount of new sales. And further, if my tally is correct, I think 40% of the company was kind of new at the end of, let's call it, 2015.","And the businesses that you added were all slightly higher organic growth and AMETEK proper at the time of acquisitions. So that didn't really show up in the industrial recession, I think, very little for many companies showed up. But I guess my question is a sort of dovetail into what is now a 5% RD&E level. Are those expenditures going more toward those faster growth acquisitions to kind of reinvigorate them?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, you know the philosophy and the way we manage our business, the R&D investments are done by the business units and they'll flow up to the corporate office and we'll review them at our budgets and our strat plans and we do that quite often. And there's certainly a filter to apply those into the higher growth opportunities that we have.","But in general, we've been a very consistent spender over many, many years and we plan to do that because we think it's key to our differentiation, it's key to keep our margins and we think we have excellent product portfolios, fresh updated product portfolios. And as we talked about earlier, our vitality index was very solid in the quarter. So the R&D investments are strong. We're going up 10% this year and I do think they're going to contribute to stronger organic growth.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So would it be appropriate to sort of paraphrase what you just said as saying that the faster growth acquisitions through the end of 2015 that they're not getting extra funds per se, but in fact, you expect those businesses to return to their prior growth rates naturally?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes. I believe that they will return to their natural growth rate as we exit the industrial recession. So I think what we saw in Q1, with the 4% organic growth, the 9% orders growth is a one thing that we can look at to get some confidence on that end. But yes, I'm really confident on our portfolio. I'm confident in the way we're managing our portfolio and we're focused on improving organic growth.","As you know, we have an initiative to improve our organic growth, and part of that focus is to improve our customer-facing capability, really make it as strong as our operational capability. So we're rolling out best practices across the company. We're working on a lot of tools. So that, combined with our R&D investment is going to take some time, but gives me confidence that we have the potential to grow at an organic rate that's a point or two higher than we've grown in the past cycle.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got you. Thank you. Here's my follow-up, Dave. The power business is certainly one of your larger platforms now. Could you kind of unbundle for us how we did by business, let's say, generation versus T&D versus UPS?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure. The UPS business is the biggest part of the business. It had strong orders growth globally. The test and measurement part of it is that had a substantial growth that we talked about because it was the business that booked the $24 million order that I mentioned. And our generation business was in line with what we expected it to be, so in this quarter, we saw solid results from our UPS business, our uninterruptible power business, but the outperformer in orders was really the test and measurement business.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Your T&D business was up as well or no?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, our T&D business was up, yes, but the power and industrial segment is the one of the places we raised the organic growth below single digits and it was because of the orders performance in Q1.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks very much.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","You're welcome, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank America. Your line is open.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Congratulation on a good quarter, returning back to growth.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question. We've been getting a lot of questions from investors on aerospace. Wide body build is slowing and people are getting concerned maybe about narrow body. Could you just tell us, a, just to remind us what the exposure is in your commercial aerospace business; and what kind of visibility you guys have ahead and what are you seeing?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. I feel really good about our aerospace business and we've called that up low to mid-single digits for the year. If you remember, 35% of AMETEK's business is in the military market. So that's not really exposed to the wide body dynamic that's going on right now.","And in the military market, we're quoting a lot of things and we have some program timing issues, because we're not sure when the U.S. government's going to spend money, but we think there's definitely more upside than downside on that part of aerospace. And we think that's going to definitely be up for the year. When you think about our commercial business, that's about 25% of our aerospace business, so military 35%; commercial 25%. About half of that is aftermarket, proprietary parts that we sell directly to airlines. And the other half of that is commercial OEM.","Now the commercial OEM market is we're benefiting from the fact that over the past 10 years, we won substantial content on Airbus platforms. So with the A350, with the A320neo, those programs are allowing us to grow faster than the market and that's going to continue for a while.","Then you go to the next segment. About 30% of aerospace is our third-party MRO business. That will be up mid-single digits for the year. Feel real good what's going on with that business, and the smallest part of our business, our business and regional jet market, that's about 10% of our aerospace exposure. That had a bad year last year. We were down substantially but we won some new programs and we had an uptick in Q1. So all of our aerospace segments we're saying are going to grow this year and we feel real good about that segment.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","This is very useful. And just on energy, you did highlight that things are getting better. Can you give us a little bit more color by region and also, if you have any view, if you're seeing any kinds of improvement in offshore?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. By region, we saw the North American MRO business strong and the upstream business strong. And the one thing that stood out for me in the quarter was the Middle East was also strong for our mid and downstream businesses. But as you know, this is a global business for us, about one-third of it in the U.S., two-thirds of it international. But those will be the things that stood out. North America for upstream, really MRO across the board and the strong performance in the Middle East where we made investments over the past couple of years and now we're benefiting from those investments.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just to follow-up. First, just follow-up on Middle East and my understanding is it's pretty much everything, Saudi's still maybe weak but everything outside of Saudi is getting better. Is that a fair description?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","We're seeing regions outside of Saudi getting better but some of our projects are within Saudi...","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. And then just a follow-up on \u2013 sorry for taking time, but just a follow-up on offshore, any signs of life there?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Quotations, we're quoting some things in the offshore market but that's more longer cycle.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Really appreciate the time. Thanks so much.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jim Foung of Gabelli & Company. Your line is open.","James V. Foung - Gabelli & Company","Hi. Good morning. Good quarter, guys.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Jim.","James V. Foung - Gabelli & Company","Dave, maybe just talk a little bit about MOCON where you are in terms of meeting the regulatory issues and maybe could you just talk a little bit about on also the market opportunities, how big the market is for MOCON and the tangent markets you'd like to get into?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. We're very pleased to sign a definitive agreement to acquire MOCON. It's an outstanding company with an excellent management team and they have a very strong niche position in gas analysis instrumentation that serves the food, beverage and pharma market.","The company is a leader in a couple of niches, the permeation testing niche and the food and pharma package testing. They have a strong growth profile with a mid-single-digit grower. It's typically been a non-cyclical market. There's a solid mix of aftermarket sales at about 35% of the business, diverse blue-chip customer base, smaller competitors. They're the leader in their niche markets. It's an ideal company that checks a lot of the acquisition criteria that we have, so we're very comfortable with the deal and it's going to be a win-win for both companies' shareholders.","We signed the agreement on April 16. We expect to close in late Q2 and early Q3. And we'll need \u2013 the closing is conditional on MOCON shareholder approval and the antitrust approval. And all of the filings for those have occurred. So we're right on schedule there and we're very pleased and we think it's beneficial to both companies' shareholders.","James V. Foung - Gabelli & Company","Great. And then \u2013 I know you talked a little bit about Rauland-Borg a little bit and I know you have some growth opportunities there. Will we see more costs first as you embark on the growth opportunity before we see the benefits from those initiatives?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","I think our operational excellence will certainly occur soon in regard to Rauland. We're already working on that. And we saw that with the family-owned business, they weren't really focused on acquisitions and international expansion. So we've already started a deal pipeline for Rauland, and with international expansion that's going to take some time. So you could see a scenario we get the benefits from OpEx initially. We get the growing international business and then we can fill in what Rauland needs with some acquisitions. So it's a lot of value enhancer for AMETEK and we're very, very pleased to own the business. The team hit the ground running and we're very pleased with the performance of the team.","James V. Foung - Gabelli & Company","Terrific, great. Thanks a lot. That's all I have.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is open.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask quick. I mean you mentioned heavy truck earlier still weak. Are you seeing any inflection in your businesses, the data from some of those markets are starting to look decently better?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes. Heavy trucks is a small part of our power and industrial business. It's only about 2% of AMETEK. And we went into the year with a pretty negative view on the market and we were down in sales in Q1, but the recent data shows the heavy truck market inflecting up in what was a substantial decline in the market.","Now the market is predicting an order rate that's closer to flat or down just a bit. So we're optimistic that that's going to be better than as we have planned, but we're keeping our current thoughts on the market or forecast for the market unchanged.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then when I look at your total, your organic outlook and your cost-out outlook, it just feels like the guide is \u2013 is it fair to say it's pretty modest in light of what you're seeing incrementally better on the top line and on orders in $100 million in cost out, is that a fair assessment?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","I wouldn't say it's modest. It's a bit conservative but there's some \u2013 we have to execute to make those numbers. We're coming out of a two-year industrial recession. You've got to make that $100 million in cost outs happen. We're good at that, but they've got to happen.","We had one quarter of organic growth. So we're pleased with stronger sales, orders and EPS and we're a bit conservative. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but we have to work to get the number.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","I feel like one of the things that people are a bit maybe, and this is not an AMETEK-specific thing, you mentioned core incrementals are about 30%, which is nice. I think some are concerned that a lot of the cost-out measures we've seen companies take over the last couple of years may lead to some costs having to come back as you start to see volume, so maybe a little bit less fixed cost takeout than people initially thought. How would you respond to something like that?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're going to get core incremental growth and we're also going to invest in our businesses for the long term. And I think the AMETEK model of our strong operational excellence capabilities and our pricing power allows us to do both. So I really don't see a lack of cost reduction opportunities and I see us being able to execute our cost reduction while also investing in our business and growing.","So I don't really see a situation where we have to put a bunch of costs back into the business to execute the plan. I mean we've already communicated that we have a healthy investment level this year, $65 million in growth investments.","So we're doing the right things for these businesses in the long term, but the cost out in our model is something that's built into our culture. It's built into our strong operating managers and I don't \u2013 I see that going on for some time.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Yes. Good morning. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Morning.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Just a quick question, Dave. When I look at the second quarter guide, just kind of back to the incrementals here, the second quarter guide kind of implies zero incremental and I know it's kind of at the corporate average EBIT. And is that \u2013 are we picking up there maybe conservatism on the sales side, not driving a lot of EPS?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","I think when you look at Q2, the one thing that stood out to me, a lot of the growth is coming from acquisitions. So we had Rauland for seven weeks in Q1. You have a full quarter of Rauland. And if you look at from Q1 to Q2, the core sales, they're roughly flattish. And we had a little bit of more difficult organic growth comp in Q2 that weren't good last year, but it was a little bit better in Q2 than Q1. So it's a bit conservative, but when you work through the numbers, it's a good number.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then also, I may not have caught this correctly, but did you mention that the cost-driven motors business in EMG now look like it might be up low-single digits? Is that...?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I did. We changed that to be up low to mid single-digits organically, so that was a change from the prior guidance and that business is just performing well. And we had a good first quarter so that was prudent to take that one up because we have very strong backlog and visibility.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co.","And any big share gain there, or just large order, anything that gives you that visibility? Because that business can be a little tough to predict as the year goes on.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. It can be tough to predict and we've done a good job of migrating to better opportunities and we have a solid backlog.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. Okay, very good. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time.

We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then open it up for questions.","I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.","Dave Zapico","Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. AMETEK delivered another outstanding quarter with exceptional operating performance, earnings above expectations, solid organic sales growth, and the acquisition of two highly strategic businesses. Our execution of the AMETEK growth model, including an increased focus on operational excellence allowed us to report record levels of EBITDA, operating income and diluted earnings per share in the quarter.","Additionally, our business has generated record operating cash flow, providing the capital to support our growth model and drive strong long-term shareholder returns. Given our results in the quarter, we will once again raise our earnings guidance for 2019.","Now on to the financial highlights for the quarter. Total sales were $1.28 billion, up 7%, compared to the third quarter of 2018. Organic sales were up 3%, acquisitions added 5%, and foreign currency was a one point headwind.","AMETEK's operating performance in the quarter was exceptional, resulting in record operating results and robust margin expansion. EBITDA in the third quarter increased 12% over the prior year to $349 million. EBITDA margins in the quarter were also excellent at 27.4%. Operating income was $301.1 million in the quarter, up 13% over the third quarter of 2018. Reported operating income margins were up an impressive 140 basis points to 23.6%. And excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins increased 150 basis points over the prior-year period.","Earnings in the third quarter were $1.06 per diluted share, up 16% over the same quarter in 2018. This comfortably exceeded our guidance range of $1 to a $1.02 per share. Additionally, our business has generated $330 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, up an impressive 33% over the same period last year, resulting in outstanding cash conversion in the quarter.","Now onto the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG sales in the quarter were $815.6 million, up 10% over last year's third quarter. Recent acquisitions contributed 7%, organic sales added 3% and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind.","We continue to see solid growth across our Aerospace, Defense and Process businesses, with particularly strong growth again in our Materials Analysis division. EIG delivered fantastic operating performance in the quarter, with operating income up 15% to a record $219.5 million. Reported operating income margins increased 130 basis points to 26.9%. And excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG's operating margins expanded an impressive 170 basis points over the third quarter of 2018.","The Electromechanical Group also performed exceptionally well in the quarter, with solid organic sales growth and superb operating performance. Sales in the third quarter for EMG were $461.1 million, up 2% over the same quarter in 2018. Organic sales grew 3%, with contributions from the acquisition of Pacific Design Technologies being more than offset by foreign currency headwinds. Strong growth across our Engineered Materials and Aerospace & Defense businesses in the quarter was offset in part by continued slowing in our Automation business.","EMG's operating performance in the third quarter was also outstanding. Operating income increased to a record $103.5 million, up 12% over the 2018 third quarter. EMG\u2019s operating income margins increased sharply to a record 22.4%, up 180 basis points over the prior-year period. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, EMG margin expanded 190 basis points in the quarter.","To summarize, AMETEK delivered another quarter of fantastic results, reflecting the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model and the excellent work of our colleagues worldwide. Before providing our updated guidance for 2019, I wanted to provide some additional highlights for the quarter.","First, I'd like to congratulate the team at CAMECA for their recent launch of the EIKOS-UV Atom Probe microscope. CAMECA is the world leader in Atom Probe Tomography. The new Atom Probe Tomography scope reinforces the leadership position with increased ease-of-use at a lower cost of ownership.","The EIKOS-UV delivers nanoscale structural information enabling a new understanding of materials for research and faster development of products for industrial applications. This new product complements CAMECA's LEAP 5000 Atom Probe which provides the fastest most sensitive 3D imaging and analysis system with nanoscale resolutions across a wide range of applications.","Developing leading-edge technologies is the core to AMETEK's success. We are committed to continuing our strong levels of investment in research, development and engineering of new products and the solutions to drive innovation across our businesses.","For all of 2019, we expect to invest more than $260 million in RD&E, a 13% increase over 2018. This level of investment and success of our R&D effort leads to a healthy vitality index. Our vitality index which is a measure of sales from products and solutions introduced over the last three years was excellent at 24% in the third quarter. We also remain committed to investing in our sales and service capabilities to support our global and market expansion initiatives.","And in September, we unveiled our newest center of excellence in Singapore. This center of excellence, which is similar to other centers we have around the world, includes products and solutions from numerous AMETEK businesses including Rauland, Taylor Hobson, ZYGO, EDAX, Programmable Power and others. This state-of-the-art facility serves as a product showcase, application lab and service facility for our customers and partners in the region. Congratulations to our teams on this important effort.","Now shifting to acquisitions. It has been another very active and highly successful year on the acquisition front. Since our last earnings call, we've acquired two excellent businesses: Pacific Design Technologies, or PDT for short, and Gatan. I'll touch briefly on these acquisitions, first PDT.","PDT is a leading provider of advanced, mission-critical thermal management solutions. Their custom-engineered liquid cooling systems and components are used across a broad set of current and next-generation commercial aerospace, defense and space platforms.","PDT is an excellent fit with our Thermal Management Systems business, given their complementary thermal management solutions and deep R&D expertise. PDT is headquartered in Goleta, California and has annual sales of approximately $40 million. We deployed approximately $125 million on the acquisition.","Now moving to AMETEK's largest acquisition today, Gatan, which we acquired this week. Gatan is a tremendous acquisition for AMETEK. Market leading technologies, premier brand, highly complementary fit with our existing instrumentation businesses, attractive mid to high single-digit growth rates, excellent profitability and cash flow and the ability to drive improved profitability with excellent returns on capital. Overall, an excellent acquisition.","So a little more on the business. Gatan is a leading brand in direct detection technology for electron microscopy, supporting high-end research and materials and life science applications. Their solutions enable improved microscopy workflows and specimen preparation, imaging and analysis.","Gatan's technology and product offering nicely complements our Materials Analysis Business, providing AMETEK with an enhanced position in high-end analytical instrumentation and expanded capabilities in the Life Sciences market. The business is headquartered in Pleasanton, California and has annual sales of approximately $180 million. We deployed approximately $925 million on this acquisition.","Thus far in 2019, we deployed nearly $1.1 billion on these two acquisitions. This follows 2018 when we deployed over $1.1 billion on six acquisitions, resulting in approximately $2.2 billion of capital deployed on acquisitions over the last two years.","This success speaks to the strength and discipline of our acquisition and integration process. Even with this level of activity, our acquisition pipeline remains full and we have significant balance sheet capacity to continue our acquisition strategy.","As we integrate these recent acquisitions into AMETEK, we look for them to embrace each of the elements of the AMETEK growth model, including our operational excellence strategy focused on cost and asset management. As evidenced in our tremendous operating performance, margin expansion and cash flow generation this year, our businesses continue to drive meaningful and efficiency improvements through the implementation of our operational excellence initiatives. We have again increased our full year target for operational excellence savings from $85 million to now $90 million of savings in 2019. Our operational excellence strategy plays an increasingly important role, given the uncertain global economic environment.","Now shifting to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Given our strong results in the third quarter, we now expect 2019 earnings to be in the range of $4.12 to $4.14 per diluted share, up 13% over 2018's earnings per diluted share. This new guidance range has increased from our previous guidance range of $4.04 to $4.10 per diluted share.","We expect overall sales for the year to be up mid to high single digits with organic sales growth of approximately 3%. Fourth quarter sales are expected to be up mid-single digits with earnings in the range of $1.01 to $1.03 per diluted share, up 5% to 7% over the prior year.","To summarize, our third quarter performance was excellent. We are well-positioned to managing in a challenging economic environment given the flexibility of our growth model and proven operating capability.","I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?","Bill Burke","Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted AMETEK had an excellent third quarter with strong operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights. Core selling expense in the quarter was down slightly versus the third quarter of last year. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were up $4.1 million year-over-year on higher compensation expense. For the full year, we expect general and administrative expenses to be approximately 1.5% of sales in line with 2018. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.5%, down from last year's third quarter tax rate of 21.9%.","For 2019, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.","Working capital was 18.2% in the third quarter, down slightly from 18.3% in the second quarter of this year. Capital expenditures were $18 million in the quarter and $62 million for the year-to-date. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million or about 1.9% of sales.","Depreciation and amortization expense was $55 million in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $235 million, including after tax acquisition related intangible amortization of $100 million or $0.44 per diluted share.","Our businesses continue to generate very strong levels of cash flow. Third quarter operating cash flow was a record $330 million, up 33% over last year's third quarter. Free cash flow was $311 million, up 35% over the same period. As a percentage of net income, free cash flow conversion was an impressive 141% in the quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 110% of net income.","Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $2.43 billion, down from $2.63 billion at the end of 2018. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $735 million, resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of September 30 of 1.2 times.","As Dave noted, we continue to be very active deploying our capital on strategic acquisitions. In the third quarter, we acquired PDT and subsequent to the end of the quarter we acquired Gatan. Combined, we deployed $1.1 billion on these two acquisitions.","Our pipeline remains healthy and we have significant financial flexibility to continue to execute our acquisition strategy with approximately $1.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities available following the Gatan acquisition.","In summary, our businesses delivered excellent results in the third quarter and through the first nine months of the year. We remain well-positioned to support our long-term growth strategy given our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows.","Kevin? ","Kevin Coleman","Thank you, Bill. Justin, could we please open the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Matt Summerville","Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, Dave can you maybe talk a little bit about what incoming organic order rates look like during the quarter in total for AMETEK and across the two segments?","Dave Zapico","Yeah. Sure, Matt. Overall, orders were up 3% in the quarter. Organic orders were down negative 2.5%. And if I look at that by group, the EIG organic orders remain solid. They were positive. Solid across most of EIG portfolio, aerospace, process, medical. EMG orders were down, mainly due to our automation business and Asia. As we highlighted last quarter, we're experiencing soft conditions in those two areas and \u2013 which continued into quarter three.","Matt Summerville","And then, maybe, just talk a little bit more about the Gatan acquisition. Historically speaking, shied away might be too strong of a term, but you haven't really done much in the Life Sciences space, opting instead more for medical and healthcare with Rauland and some of the other businesses.","So maybe talk about what attracted you now to Life Sciences? So maybe sort of a why now question. And then, what you see in that business potentially from a synergy standpoint and the level of cyclicality we should expect out of that business?","Dave Zapico","Right, right. Yeah. Our Materials Analysis business that Gatan will become a business unit of, has had an existing Life Science presence and it's been a small presence and we haven't talked about it much, but certainly with Gatan they're \u2013 in market they're a 50-50 split between life sciences, so biology, cancer research and then material sciences. So it fits our existing profile. But it does add life sciences capability and we really like that. And with their technology and what their market exposures, there's really attractive growth opportunities. We think it's a mid to high single-digit grower. I mean, when I think about the Gatan business, it's a very differentiated technology business. It's a sizable transaction with strong profitability for AMETEK shareholders will get a good return on capital.","It's a premier brand. We followed this business for a long time. It's a premier brand. They have highly specialized intellectual properties over 150 patents in the business and a strong management team. They\u2019re staying with the business so we're pleased about that. And it's a business that is dependent on new product introductions. So we're going to have to work on the new product introduction cycle because that drives a lot of growth. And I think you can expect it to fit into MAD and MAD is performing very well for AMETEK. So it's a great add to MAD. So we're very excited about the acquisition.","Matt Summerville","Thanks.","Dave Zapico","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Dave Zapico","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, Dave maybe pick up on your last point about the macro-environment. You said it's a challenging operating environment, but you put up great margins and cash flow. But you did point to some weakness in automation in Asia and this is consistent with what we've seen elsewhere in the sector this quarter, short-cycle pressures in Asia in particular. So could you expand a bit on what you're seeing in the automation side in terms of the softness? And then how would you characterize the softness in Asia? Is that trade uncertainty related?","Dave Zapico","Yeah. Sure Deane. Asia was down for us by -- I'll start with the geography question. Asia was down mid-single digits and that was driven by China, so very similar to quarter two for us. So, it was really the same trend. Our automation business did not weaken sequentially. It was the same trend.","But at the same time, the other geographic results were similar to the second quarter. We were up mid-single digits with broad-based growth in the U.S., and in Europe we were up mid-single digits and we have aerospace and our oil and gas business and really a lot of businesses did well in Europe.","So the -- it felt like Q2, the weakness played into Q3 continue to -- didn't get weaker. And we did see a little bit of incremental industrial weakness that showed up in our Power and Industrial business in quarter three. But overall when you think about our portfolio, our Aerospace business is very strong. Our Process businesses are rock solid. And our medical business is holding up well. And we have a weakness in automation in Asia and then we have a bit of incremental Industrial weakness and that's the full picture that we have.","Deane Dray","That certainly is consistent with what we've been seeing. Any comments about how October has played out? And then I know you're not in the business yet of giving 2020 guidance but just qualitatively for this challenging operating environment, what's the setup for next year for AMETEK in the way your discussions with customers, the visibility on product introductions and so forth? Thanks.","Dave Zapico","Right. I'll start with the insight in 2020. As is typical for this time of the year, we're not going to give guidance for 2020 as you know Deane, and during November and December, we're going to sit down with our teams and work with the businesses to build a bottom-up budget and this will include a detailed review of our niche markets, which are sometimes different than the overall macro. And the risks and opportunities that our businesses see in their 2020 business plan.","I think in terms of operating in this kind of environment with trade tensions and customers hesitant to spend and ordering patterns changing a bit in terms of just giving an order for what you need versus giving you a longer-term outlook at something there are some issues to deal with.","But AMETEK is ideally suited to thrive in this environment because we have the OpEx capability, it's in our DNA and we have the M&A driver. And we're going to put those two elements of our strategy to work and succeed in the current environment. That's the way we're looking at it and that will go into our 2020 planning.","Deane Dray","And any comments on October?","Dave Zapico","October, yes. Yeah, I'll get back to that. Yeah, throughout the quarter, we looked at our orders and they were okay in July. They stepped up a bit in August as we typically have. And then September sometime when -- September was stronger than August, but we didn't get the big spike of orders in September. So it was a bit muted. It was still better than August. So we had a normal stair-step through the quarter. And then October starting out right on plan, so October feels better, a lot like the first quarter of the first month of Q2 ,so -- and Q3. So we got this trend where we're stepping up by month of the quarter, but it's a bit muted usually in the last month of the quarter.","Deane Dray","Terrific. And then congratulations on Gatan. That's a great asset. Thank you.","Dave Zapico","Thank you. Thank you Dean. We feel the same way.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning, guys.","Dave Zapico","Hi, Josh good morning.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just -- one of the questions we get a lot is, kind of, AMETEK compared this cycle to maybe the last industrial slowdown. I know it's something that comes up from time to time on calls that folks are always worried that the next move of the ISM is going to be down for AMETEK. But you guys have been much more resilient especially this year. Can you talk David all about, how you're mixing up through M&A whether that's margins or organic growth? And maybe specifically on how the, kind of, portfolio evolution of exposure to customers R&D versus CapEx spend has maybe changed?","Dave Zapico","Yeah, sure. I mean, every slowdown is a bit different Josh. So basing performance on the prior slowdown is often -- is not going to work out. But what we see is we really have as I mentioned to Deane earlier, we have elements of our portfolio that are continuing to perform very well. Our Aerospace business is strong and that's strong across all segments of Aerospace, and we have some good wins in Aerospace that we're going to continue to benefit from. Our Process and Analytical instrumentation, we added some healthcare to that and that's holding up very well for us.","The commodity parts of our businesses that were about 22% of our sales before we head into the 2015, 2016 downturn. They're down around 16% of our businesses, because we grew around them. At the same time, those businesses are performing well right now. So this doesn't feel like the prior downturn for us. And -- but there is -- this one is -- I'll call it self induced and it's different. And it's really trade-related to start at it, and it's affecting the customer behavior because of that.","And what we're going to do is whatever the economy brings to us; we're going to operate well in it. And we think we're well-positioned with our operational excellence capability. And we have the M&A driver and it's working very well. So, we're -- like I said before, we're looking to outperform in the current environment.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Terrific. And then just a follow-up. Obviously, margins have been pretty spectacular throughout the year; I think another step-up in the third quarter. How should we think about kind of the progression from here? And any kind of puts and takes, either related to seasonality or any kind of blue birds in the quarter that may have helped out?","Dave Zapico","Right, right. Yes, you said, we had excellent margin performance in the quarter and it was primarily overall excellent execution. I mean we had good price in the quarter, excellent cost reductions, the plant efficiencies were fantastic, and we had the incremental contribution margin on the incremental sales. So, we plan to keep executing that way.","I don't know if the margins are going to continue at that level. We certainly -- the way we think about our business is we think we're going to get 30 to 40 basis points of core margin expansion every year and that's kind of built into our operating model. And that's built into the way we think about operational excellence long-term. So, there's cost reduction drivers that we have in our business that -- and we pull those levers and there's plenty of runway on margins. So, that's how we think about it.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Great. Thanks for the detail and congratulations.","Dave Zapico","Yes, thanks, Josh.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning.","Dave Zapico","Good morning Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Hey, just I'll echo the comments on operating margins, great execution there. And I did want to put a finer point on kind of going to the next level on Q4 guidance. And really want to dig into Gatan. Roper mentioned that the business would be very heavy skewed towards Q4, much more so than usual this year. So, I'm just curious what you're baking in for sales, EBITDA, and the level of accretion, if any, that you have baked into Q4? And anything else that you're sort of baking into your guidance for Q4 would be helpful.","Dave Zapico","Right. So, talk about -- we own Gatan for two months and we have about $35 million of sales in our forecast over those two months. And we're planning that to be neutral to Q4 earnings at the cash EPS level.","I mean, we have -- there's purchase accounts, there's a lot of inventory in the business. So, the inventory step-up charges are significant. We have all the deal costs. We have higher interest expense, one-time charges. And as a matter of fact, Q4 was front-end loaded per Gatan's forecast. So, when you take the $35 million that we're forecasting and what we think Gatan did in October, really quarter-over-quarter; it's about the same as it did last year. And the management team is -- they've been through a lot. They've been through an extended sales process. There's a lot of integration activity and -- but we're going to push forward with a Q4 equal to last year's Q4, which was good.","Nigel Coe","Sorry about that. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And if you want to prognosticate on Gatan EPS increase for next year that would be great. But I did want to touch on Josh's question a slightly different way. And if we take the acquisitions you've done for the past, call it, two or three years, and I'm thinking here about Rauland-Borg, Tell [ph], Spectro, et cetera. How are those businesses performing right now relative to the 3% you just put up? I mean are they above that bar? Are they stable? I mean how does that look?","Bill Burke","Yeah. I think the acquisitions being primarily North America focused, like WR, like Rauland-Borg and the end markets that they're in, they're performing very well. So they're at\/or above our model. And the U.S. centricity of some of those businesses is clearly helping us in the current environment.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great. Thank you, Bill.","Bill Burke","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Andrew Obin","Hey, guys. Good morning. Great quarter.","Dave Zapico","Yeah. Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question. Can we talk a little bit about aerospace and specifically, A, can you remind us of the composition of your aerospace exposure? And can we talk about what are you seeing about commercial aftermarket business as traffic slows? And also, what are you guys seeing on bizjets, because I know that's an important business for you as well? Thanks.","Dave Zapico","So, broad-brush, our aerospace business is about 35% military, about 30% third-party MRO, about 25% commercial, and that's equally split between the OEM and the proprietary spare parts that come from that and about 10% of the business jet market.","And the aerospace business for us, in Q3 the whole business was up high single digits. It was strong in all segments. Our commercial business in Q3 was up mid-teens. So we had strong OEM sales to the Airbus 320 platform, the 787, the LEAP and GTF engines are doing well.","Our third-party MRO business had an excellent quarter, up high single digits. Our military business was up high \u2013 mid-single digits. So solid demand in both the U.S. and international programs, our strength in missiles, radar systems, general spending tied to improving fleet readiness, and our business jet market was up high teens.","And at easier comp, but it was up high teens. So we really had a fantastic performance in our aerospace business in the quarter. And the backlogs are very solid. And to your specific question, our aftermarket was very solid in Q3, and we're not seeing a sign of a slowdown.","Andrew Obin","I guess Eleanor is doing quite well.","Dave Zapico","Eleanor has fantastic orders.","Andrew Obin","Just a follow-up question and this is more for my decision. How should I think about the relationship directionally between your order rates and organic growth? Because, clearly, orders slowed last quarter. We did not see a similar slowdown in revenue this quarter, what has continued to slow. And clearly, you guys think that revenue can continue to outpace the orders. What's the disconnect? Thank you.","Dave Zapico","I think, the biggest disconnect there is, we have a pretty healthy backlog. So it's about a $1.63 billion backlog at the end of Q3, and it provides some conversion opportunities. And the balance of our business besides the aerospace and defense business, we're probably going through a quarter, needing about 50% of the orders to make the quarter, but we have some visibility in our aerospace and defense businesses.","And we're operating the company well, and we're able to convert on them. So we feel comfortable with our guide. And we have \u2013 cautious, given the global macro conditions. And -- but our factories are executing extremely positively right now. So I feel very confident that if there's incoming orders or opportunities in our backlog to execute on it, we can. And that's how you bring together a flat to slightly declining order picture and combine it with growing organically.","Andrew Obin","Very clear that the team is executing very well. Thank you.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Allison Poliniak","Hi guys, good morning.","Dave Zapico","Good morning, Allison.","Allison Poliniak","Just following up on that backlog commentary. Are you getting any, sort of, pushback or delays within that backlog that, I guess, delaying some of that conversion?","Dave Zapico","Yeah, there's a changing order pattern that we saw in the quarter. And typically, a customer will give you a purchase order with three or six month\u2019s visibility. And now when they're giving us a replenishment purchase order, they're really giving it month-to-month, just what they need. So there is an element of the global macro conditions that are impacting our order input.","But our cycle times are reduced, and our factory execution is really good. So we're able to deal with that on and turn things very quickly. But certainly, there is a change in the ordering environment that wasn't there six months ago.","Allison Poliniak","Great. And then just on the OpEx savings, is that because of that step up because of Gatan and the acquisitions? Or is that organic that you guys are accelerating some of that?","Dave Zapico","Yeah. There's no OpEx savings in the final two months for Gatan. It's organic savings, we boosted our material savings from -- up to $70 million. That was the $5 million increase in -- with all the tariff activity. We have a world-class sourcing organization. And they're executing on it, resourcing the products at a faster rate than we thought they would, and we're getting incremental savings from it because we're finding lower cost in other places in the world. So it's -- that's what's driving the savings up to the $90 million. It's all material cost savings.","Allison Poliniak","Okay. Thank you.","Dave Zapico","Thank you, Allison.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stephens. Your line is now open.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the quarter.","Dave Zapico","Thank you, Rob.","Robert McCarthy","I guess, first on Gatan kind of stepping back, obviously, a very well-run company under Roper's per view, but obviously, Roper in terms of its governance and overall models, not big on centralization and cost synergies among their various disparate businesses. Clearly, that's a point of differentiation. So, could you expand qualitatively or quantitatively about how you see the opportunity to expand margins? And maybe a little bit of color around fixed cost leverage, SG&A, gross margins? Where do you think are the biggest buckets where you can drive incremental value on that?","Dave Zapico","Yeah. Sure, sure. It\u2019s obvious question, and we're going to work with the Gatan team to come up with a plan that we both agree with, because we think there are some opportunities, but we get buy-in from the management teams. But what we see is, it's more like a typical deal synergy for us. There's a lot of opportunity in the supply chain to reduce costs. There's eight remote sales and service offices, so a bigger than typical opportunity to benefit from the AMETEK G&A internationally.","There's also opportunities to improve working capital. This business is running at a working capital level in the mid-20s, and our equivalent business is running at about 14% in materials analysis. AMETEK's overall working capital is about 18.2% in the quarter.","So we add that all up, the cost synergy from the supply chain, the substantial synergy from the international offices, the ability to reduce working capital and we think it's going to be a great return for our shareholders. We think we'll get a return on invested capital of 10% in year 3, and we're excited about it.","Robert McCarthy","And just on that point, as one brief follow-up on Gatan. What do you think about the perspective of the growth rate? Because I think you talk about mid single-digit organic growth. But just in doing our own due diligence, it could be fairly lumpy.","And part and parcel of that is, they're definitely seems to be more of a product cycle business, branded their hit rate on product cycles are very high. But aftermarket may be more of a concern. So how would you talk about kind of the sustainability of growth and managing a little bit of a lumpiness there?","Dave Zapico","Right. Yes. Naturally, the business is a bit lumpy. And -- but they're direct detection cameras, they're fantastic technologies. They were -- and they've really enabled a new technique called CRY OEM; cryo electron microscopy. And this technique is being developed for drugs and vaccines, and it's opened up the life sciences market to a greater degree for them.","So they're really in the -- they have a good long-term demand driver, only about 10% of the business is aftermarket, but -- and it is a bit lumpy, and it's driven by new product cycles. So one of the things we're going to try to do is increase the velocity of the new product cycles, but we'll deal with a bit of lumpiness. And we like the business a lot.","Robert McCarthy","Thank you.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is now open.","Richard Eastman","Yes, good morning. Could you just give us a sense of what price did, price capture and net price capture in the quarter?","Dave Zapico","Yes. Q3 was much like the first half of 2019. We had an excellent quarter. So we achieved a little bit more than 2 points of price across our entire business. Total inflation and the impact of tariffs was a bit less than 1.5%. So we're very pleased with the results and they speak to the highly differentiated nature of our product portfolio. We have leadership positions in the niche markets around the globe, and it's playing itself out in these uncertain times.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then could you -- Dave, perhaps just shift through EMG's core growth rate by segment a little bit or by business within EMG. We had 3%. I'm just a little bit curious. I mean automation softened. But just -- and could you do that, please?","Dave Zapico","Yes, I could. If you look at the market segments and automation and engineered solutions, so they already got the automation business is about half of it and Engineered solutions, which is basically is about the other half of it. So we had solid growth in the EMIP business.","It was up I think it was up mid-single digits in the quarter, and automation was down. And overall, it was up low single digits for the quarter. So really, the EMIP business is performing very well.","And as we mentioned, we have a problem in -- with the slowdown in our automation business. And when you think about our thermal Management Systems business, that's the other business in there. They had a solid quarter, in line with our aerospace business. .","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just is the EMIP business following the aerospace business up? I mean is that where the strength is kind of generated?","Dave Zapico","I mean the end markets for EMIP, our aerospace and medical and specialized industrial. So that mid-single-digit growth was across all those markets. So they really done well.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just my last question, David, as you kind of sit here today, and I know we don't want to touch 2020 from an outlook perspective, maybe on the sales line. But is it your sense that we're seeing enough slowing into this \u2013 into the fourth quarter here that we maybe have to take a harder look at the cost side of the business, whether it would be savings plans or any sort of tighter restructuring or realignment of cost? Where do you sit on that? Or is it kind of business as usual, and we're going to walk into this with our operational excellence plan and eyes wide open?","Dave Zapico","That's a great question, Rick. And I'll start with the point that we have people running the businesses that are good operators of the businesses. And we're going to go through a budget process with each of our business units. And you can see in the results, they're already naturally reacting to the changing global conditions.","And right now, this feels for \u2013 this feels like a \u2013 for Bill and I, like a business-to-business discussion. So we're going to sit down with these budgets, and we're going to understand the projects that they want to fund and what makes sense for AMETEK to fund and what makes sense for their businesses to act on.","And right now, it seems like a business-to-business decision. But if it turns into a broader alignment, if it certainly weakens further. We're not there yet, but that's an option, and we're going to really explore that in detail during November and the beginning part of December.","And the important thing for us is that we're going to continue to invest in attractive opportunities that and make our core stronger, and that's our talent development, our innovation but we're really good at managing costs. And we'll have a good, healthy discussions during our budget process, and I expect that it will be a business-to-business discussion, and the businesses will come with opportunities to us to...","Richard Eastman","And given some of \u2013 given some of your business, I'm thinking aerospace is kind of in the backlog, and we're talking about backlog conversion here kind of rolling forward. Do you sense that the pricing contribution in 2020 would be as great in 2020, as it has been here in 2019? I mean, is there visibility in your backlog on price for next year?","Dave Zapico","That's a good question, Rick. And we're going to have that detail when we go through our budget, but my feeling is that the pricing power of our portfolio is something that \u2013 through up cycles or down cycles, is there. And I think the level of pricing offsetting cost and inflation in tariffs is going to stay. So I'd be very surprised if pricing did not exceed inflation in tariffs in 2020.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Linzey from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Brett Linzey","Hi, good morning, guys. I just want to come back to thinking about the next year, 2020. Just in the context of margins, obviously, the revenue like a go either way, but thinking of Q2 or Q3 is sort of the run rate, low single-digit organic decline environment. Do you think that based on the deals you've done, some of the actions underway that you can actually grow margins in a down organic sales environment next year?","Dave Zapico","Yes. I think it's possible. It has to do with \u2013 to Rick's question, the prior question, the level of pricing that you get and the level of acquisition synergies that we're executing on. But if you have a modestly declining order input, yes, you can expand margins like that. It won't be like the margins that you see in the second quarter, but certainly an up margin trajectory as possible.","Brett Linzey","Okay, great. And then maybe just another question on metals. Obviously, good performance here in the quarter. I think you said mid-single digits. What's your visibility into the value chain or the supply chain on inventory levels? I know last cycle kind of got back -- kind of backfilled as you worked up the value chain. What does the inventory look like today?","Dave Zapico","Yes. The metals business, as you know, the nature of that business is we have less visibility into the -- that the inventory levels at the various customers than we do in our other business. So, our end markets right now are driving that business and aerospace and medical still feels solid. So, that will be something that we look at closely during the budget and at the end of the next quarter to understand what's happening there.","Brett Linzey","Okay. But no indication that things are full or that anything starting to back up there?","Dave Zapico","Up mid-single-digit quarter.","Brett Linzey","Yeah. Okay, great. Appreciate, I'll leave it there.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. This is Robert in for Joe. Congrats in the quarter. Good morning. Just a high-level question as we head into next year, not specific guidance. But are there any particular end markets that you feel are kind of like at risk versus your current view this year? And did you see any changes in any end markets this quarter that you found surprising? Or any changes in trends that are worth noting? Thank you.","Dave Zapico","Sure. It's really the comment that I made before. Q3 felt very similar to Q2, but we did see some incremental weakening in our industrial businesses. And when we go into next year, we're going to have a clear view of that once we work through our budget process with all of our businesses because we have some niche exposures that are a little bit different than the overall macro, and we have to understand that. But certainly, the aerospace business feels very solid right now.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia from Berenberg.","Andrew Buscaglia","Hey guys. Can you comment just a little bit more on Gatan? And correct me if I'm wrong, I think the price Thermo Fisher paid seems to be a little bit below what you guys -- your implied EBIT\/EBITDA multiple was that? And I would think that they would be able to drive synergies -- substantial synergies as well. So, can you just talk about how you -- like in terms of the valuation you've paid? And was this a competitive bid? Just talk about the process a little bit more there?","Dave Zapico","Yes, Andrew, I think you might have your numbers wrong. If you go back and look at it, we paid about the same. We paid the identical amount that Thermo paid for the business and it has about 20% more than the EBITDA now. So, the multiple is lower.","Andrew Buscaglia","Okay. And then if you could turn to Telular. So, it's been about a year since you've owned that asset. Can you provide an update on this specifically with regards to margins, where that was -- that was supposed to be a big part of the story and leveraging it across your entire business. Can you give some examples maybe of where you're going to see that?","Dave Zapico","Yes, that's a great question. Telular is performing well and we're very pleased with the business. They've come into AMETEK with lot of energy in terms of the integration. And we have a process where we're taking that IoT technology to some specific businesses and we've developed a broader thought process of applying it to other businesses within AMETEK that should be aware of the technology. So, it's going very well. We're very pleased with that management team and we're counting on them for 2020. It's going to be one of the drivers for AMETEK.","Andrew Buscaglia","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Robert McCarthy from Stephens. Your line is now open.","Rob McCarthy","Sorry for getting greedy, but a couple of cleanups, if you don't mind. I guess, first, I know, episodically, we went through some of the order rates and some of the organic growth rates. But could we do the in honor of Scott Graham, the state of the Union in terms of where organic growth is across the segments and outlook?","Dave Zapico","Sure thing, Rob. And we've covered a lot of this in the call already, but I'll just go through it all. So be a bit of a rehash. Our process businesses delivered an excellent quarter. We talked about overall mid-teens on a tonnage basis, mid-single-digit organic growth, and we had the acquisitions of Forza, Telular and Spectro Scientific and our Materials Analysis business, again, delivered particularly strong organic growth in the quarter.","And they're seeing positive results from the organic growth initiatives. So for all of 2019, we continue to expect our process businesses that have organic sales up in the mid-single-digit range. And we talked a bit about our aerospace business. They performed exceptionally well again in the third quarter was strong and balanced growth across all the businesses.","Our overall sales were up high \u2013 up 10%, driven by high single-digit organic growth. So we have the contribution from the acquisition of Pacific Design Technologies in there.","And similar to the first half, growth in the third quarter was broad-based. And I'd highlight a couple of our businesses, but it was a commercial OEM and third-party MRO, they had very good quarters, and we expect to continue to have mid- to high single-digit organic growth for all of 2019, with balanced growth across each of the markets.","And our Power and industrial segment, they were down slightly in the third quarter, driven by weakness in our industrial business. And for all of 2019, we now expect roughly flat organic sales, driven by incremental weakness in our industrial businesses.","We had a good, good quarter for our power business improving, but they're industrial power and industrial weakened a bit, and that's what we talked about in the quarter. And our automation and engineered solutions up low single-digits in the quarter. Again, solid growth across engineered solutions, offset by weakness in our automation business. So for all of 2019, we now expect low single-digit organic sales growth for our automation and engineered businesses. And that's around the horn run.","Rob McCarthy","And then just kind of last question, how much was the contribution, and it might have been alluded to, so I'm sorry if it's asked and answered, but how much in third quarter was pricing underlying your organic growth? And what is your embedded expectation for this year?","Dave Zapico","Yes. I think the \u2013 our price \u2013 we had about two points of price a little better than two points and similar expectation to continue for Q4. Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations for closing remarks.","Kevin Coleman","Great.

I'll now turn the meeting to Dave.","David Zapico","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had an excellent second quarter. We exceeded earnings guidance on solid organic sales growth, contributions from acquisitions and exceptional operating performance.","In the process, we delivered a record level of sales, EBITDA, operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We also delivered impressive growth in operating cash flow in the quarter.","Given the strong results and our outlook for the back half of the year, we have again increased our full year earnings guidance range. These results continue to highlight the strength of the AMETEK Growth Model, and our ability to deliver strong and consistent performance for our shareholders.","Now on to the financial highlights for the quarter. Total sales were a record $1.29 billion, up 7% compared to the second quarter of 2018. Organic sales growth was solid at 3%; acquisitions added 5%; and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind. EBITDA in the second quarter was a record $349 million, up 10% over the same period in 2018, and EBITDA margins were excellent at 27%.","Operating income was a record at $295.4 million, a 9% increase over the second quarter of 2018. Reported operating income margins were up 60 basis points to 22.9%. And excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins increase an impressive 110 basis points over the prior year period. This exceptional operating performance reflects the strength of our operational excellence initiatives.","Earnings were a record $1.05 per diluted share, up 14% over the prior year and exceeding our guidance range of $1 to $1.02 per diluted share. Lastly, operating cash flow was superb in the quarter, up 21% to $246 million.","Now on to the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG second quarter sales were $820.2 million, up 10% over last year's second quarter. Recent acquisitions contributed 8%, organic sales were up 3%, and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind.","Our Materials Analysis business delivered another very solid quarter. Their high-end analytical instrumentation solutions including several new product introductions are helping our customers solve increasingly complex challenges in attractive growth markets. Our Aerospace business has also performed nicely, as demand remains very solid across the aerospace and defense markets.","In addition to the strong top line growth, EIG delivered outstanding operating performance in the second quarter. Operating income increased 10% to $212.9 million with reported operating income margins of 26%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG's margins expanded 90 basis points over the prior year.","The Electromechanical Group also had a strong quarter, with solid organic sales and impressive operating performance. Second quarter sales for EMG were $469.2 million, up 1% over the same period in 2018. EMG's organic sales growth was 3% and foreign currency a 2 point headwind.","EMG's operating performance was excellent with operating income, a record $101.1 million, up 7% over the prior year second quarter.

We are firmly positioned for another year with strong growth and record results. Our highly differentiated businesses continue to execute the AMETEK growth model driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.","I'd like to highlight some of our businesses, recent accomplishments, and then I'll touch on our updated outlook and guidance for the remainder of the year.","First, I would like to congratulate the team at Creaform for recently winning two Red Dot awards for innovative product design of their HandySCAN BLACK and Go!SCAN SPARK metrology products. Launched in April, both new 3D scanners were designed with enhanced features and a sleek new ergonomic design.","Now in a third-generation, the HandySCAN BLACK has been optimized to meet the designs, meet the needs of design manufacturing and metrology professionals looking for the most effective and reliable way to acquire accurate 3D measurements of physical objects. The HandySCAN BLACK provides highly accurate and repeatable results even in difficult environments and with complex surfaces.","The Go!SCAN SPARK offers the fastest and most friendly 3D scanning experience in the market. Designed to scan any object without need for a setup, it offers flawless texture and geometry acquisition as well as impressive details in rich color palette.

In 2019, we expect to spend approximately $260 million on RD&E, up 30% over last year's level, and we are seeing excellent results and our new product vitality index was a very strong 25% in the quarter.","Now shifting to operational excellence. Our operational excellence tools are adding significant value for our businesses. We continue to drive efficiency improvements across our operation to enhance our profitability improved cash flow, as was evident in our operating performance during the second quarter.","For all of 2019, we now expect approximately $85 million in savings from our operational excellence initiatives with the majority of these savings generated for material sourcing. This is an increase from our previous estimate of $80 million in annual savings.","Finally, we remained very active yet disciplined in our acquisition efforts. Our business development teams continue to manage a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities. AMETEK remains focused on deploying our strong free cash flow on value-enhancing acquisitions.","I will now move to the updated earnings guidance for 2019. Given our performance in the second quarter and our near record backlog, we now expect 2019 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.04 to $4.10, up 10% to 12% over 2018 earnings. This new guidance range has increased from our previous guidance range of $3.98 to $4.08 per diluted share.","We continue to expect overall sales for the year to be up high single digit with organic sales up 3% to 5%. Overall sales in the third quarter are expected to be up high single digit.

We remain focused on driving continued growth through the end of the year and well into the future. Our business' market leading differentiated technologies and their execution of the AMETEK Growth Model are driving strong results for our stakeholders.","I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then, we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?","William Burke","Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted AMETEK had an excellent second quarter, capping off the first half of the year with record results. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.","Core selling expense in the second quarter was roughly in line with last year's second quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were up slightly over the same period in 2018, and as a percentage of sales were 1.4% versus last year's level of 1.5%.","The effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.4%, down from last year's second quarter tax rate of 21.9%. For 2019, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, and as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.","Working capital was 18.3% in the second quarter, essentially unchanged from the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $22 million in the quarter and for the full year of 2019 we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million or 1.9% of sales.","Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $57 million. For the full year, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $235 million including acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $130 million or $0.43 per diluted share.","Our businesses continue to generate very strong levels of cash flow. Second quarter operating cash flow was $246 million, up 21% over last year's second quarter, and free cash flow was $224 million, up 20% over last year. As a percentage of net income, free cash flow conversion was 104% and we continue to expect full year free cash flow conversion of approximately 110% of net income.","The primary use of our strong free cash flow is to support our acquisition efforts. And as Dave just noted, our pipeline remains healthy, and we have significant financial flexibility to continue our acquisition strategy.","Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $2.47 billion, down from $2.63 billion at the end of 2018. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $568 million, resulting in a net debt to EBITDA ratio as of June 30th of 1.4 times. We remain well positioned to support our growth initiatives with approximately $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities.","To conclude, our businesses delivered outstanding performance with high quality results in the second quarter. Our outlook remains positive through the back half of 2019 given our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?","David Zapico","Great. Thank you, Bill. Kevin, can we please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.","Matt Summerville","Thanks. Couple of questions. First, can you give us a little color on where incoming order rates organically were for the total company and by business? And also just given the macro choppiness out there, can you talk about what sort of linearity you saw during the quarter, and what you're seeing thus far in your business in July?","David Zapico","Sure, Matt. In terms of orders, Q2 orders were up 4% and organic orders were flat, a very slightly positive. In our EIG business, the order rates were in line with the organic sales growth in the quarter, and the EMG orders were down a bit.","We had some delays in our automation and engineered solution businesses. And we ended the quarter with a near record backlog of $1.7 billion. And in terms of the order patterns and sales patterns during the quarter, they followed a similar trend.","We had - May was a bit better than April, and June was a bit better than May, which is very typical for our business, but the growth each month as it stepped up was more subdued than past quarter. So pretty typical, but a little less of a ramp.","Matt Summerville","And then, maybe as a follow-up, where were you in the quarter on price versus inflation? Thanks.","David Zapico","Sure, Matt. Sure. Q2 was much like the second half of '18, and the first quarter of '19. We had an excellent quarter. We achieved 2 points of price across our entire portfolio. Total inflation, the impact of tariffs was a bit less than 1.5%. So we had a positive spread and we're very pleased with the results.","As you know, the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK's product portfolio. We have leadership positions in niche markets around the globe, and we really have some focus and determination to make sure we stay in front of a changing global environment. So we're very pleased with the results.","Matt Summerville","Thank you, David.","David Zapico","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning. I thought it maybe a good time to perhaps run through the end markets and the geographies in a bit more detail?","David Zapico","Right. Sure thing, Nigel. First, on our market segment commentary, I'll start with our process businesses. They had another excellent quarter with overall sales up low teens on a percentage basis, driven by mid single-digit organic sales growth, and contributions from the acquisitions of Forza, Telular and Spectro Scientific.","As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the Materials Analysis business had a particularly strong organic growth quarter driven by solid new product introductions and solid demand for their high-end instrumentation, and for all the 29 we continue to expect process organic sales to be up mid single digits.","Switch to aerospace, our aerospace and defense businesses delivered another excellent quarter with high single digit organic sales growth. This growth reflects the attractive positions we have across a diverse set of aerospace and different defense platforms. Similar to the first quarter, growth in the second quarter was broad based across our various aerospace markets.","We had a notable strength in our commercial OEM and third-party MRO businesses. And given the solid start to the year, we're increasing our expectations for aerospace and now expect mid to high single digit organic sales growth for all of 2019 with balanced growth across each market.","Our power and industrial segment, in the second quarter, sales were up low single digits, driven by the contribution from the recent acquisition of Motec. Organic sales were down slightly in the quarter and in line with our expectations. For all of 2019, we continue to expect low to mid single digit organic sales growth given the strength of our backlog and solid order patterns in these businesses.","And finally, sales of our automation and engineered solutions businesses were up low single digits for the second quarter against the difficult prior year comp. For all the 2019, we now expect low to mid single digit organic sales growth for automation and engineered solutions, and we are seeing some order delays in certain businesses. So we lowered that automation and engineered solutions segment from mid to low to mid, and we increased our aerospace guide to a bit or so.","So I'll just summarize the whole thing, further continue to expect overall full year organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. As I said, we have modestly increased growth forecast for aerospace, while modestly decreasing our growth forecast for automation and engineered solutions.","And really no change to process and power and industrial and OEM, but process performed very well in the quarter, and they look strong.","Nigel Coe","Great. Thanks, David. And maybe if you could just touch on what you've seen in China. Perhaps just address the 3% to 5% organic implies some acceleration in the back half of the year to get to the high end of that range. What gives you confidence that that can accelerate on tougher comps in the back half of the year? Thank you very much.","David Zapico","Yes, sure. Right. Yes, we had overall sales ended up within our guidance range, and organic sales ended up within our guidance range. And at the half year, we were at 4%. So right smack that middle in our guidance. So in terms of geography, we saw some solid growth across Europe and the U.S., and Asia was down mid-single digit. So you really have about 80% of our business up mid single digits, and Asia which is about 18% of our business was down mid single digits.","We see in the U.S. where we were up mid single digits, the strongest growth was at process and our aerospace businesses. In Europe, we were up mid single digits. We had broad-based growth in oil and gas, and aerospace had particularly strong quarters. And Asia was down mid single digits, and China was down a bit more than mid single digit.","So we had some down a bit more after two plus years of very strong growth, but it's about 7% of our sales, and clearly they are being impacted by the number one and number two economies in the trade war. So we're watching that closely, but given its relative size, it hasn't been too much of a headwind yet.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, David.","Thanks, David.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David Zapico","Good morning.","Josh Pokrzywinski","I guess just to follow up on the last question, thinking about some of the end markets that are doing better or ones that we got a little softer. And Dave, I think, is it a fair characterization to say, some of the longer cycle stuff aerospace process is really what gives you the visibility in the guide and the confidence in the second half? And the shorter cycle end markets in automation are, I guess, what's holding you back, but can also turn quickly. Is that a fair characterization as a starting point?","David Zapico","Yes, I'd say that's a fair characterization. In our automation businesses, we're dealing with OEM customers and they delayed placing orders in the quarter. We didn't lose these orders, they are delayed, and they're cautious, but there is a healthy order pipeline. So I would say that's a good characterization with we have strengthen in aerospace and solid with process and some weakness in automation. So that's a good summary.","Josh Pokrzywinski","So I think in the automation space, a lot of folks in that orbit have called out auto and electronics has been kind of the two biggest headwinds. Is that safe to say, it's the same end markets for you guys? Or is there something else that's cropped up within that?","David Zapico","Yes, I would say, it's - we have some motive customers there and that was weaker and there was some factor automation customers that was weaker, and to balance that there were some medical and food industry automation that we're okay with, so -- but those are OEM customers, and the motive and factory automation were the areas that it was a bit light.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. And then just one last one for me. Obviously with the string of acquisitions over the last couple of years, a bit more diversity in the portfolio and some deeper niches, how are those performed or have you even noticed the change in the growth rates or performance as some of the macro has gotten a bit choppier?","David Zapico","Yes. One of the characteristics of the acquisitions we did over the past two years were they were largely U.S.-based, and they've held up very well. So the acquisitions are performing extremely well, and they're meeting their acquisition models and is driving the performance of the company as you can see in the results.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there.","David Zapico","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","David Zapico","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Good morning. Just a question, did I hear correctly that China was down in the quarter? I apologize if I missed that.","David Zapico","Yes. What we went through, the geographies were up in the U.S., mid single digits, down in Europe, mid single digit - excuse me, up in U.S., up in Europe, mid single digits, down in Asia mid-single digits, and China was down a bit more than Asia.","Andrew Obin","Right. So the question on China, I'm just wondering, could you just walk us what happened in the quarter in China because my sense was that the Chinese business very nichey, you have a lot of growth initiatives there. And just trying to get a sense when did it turn in the quarter or if you have this granularity on the call?","David Zapico","Yes. China has been very choppy and inconsistent through the balance of this year. We do have - we had very difficult comps that we were running into there. So it was mainly in our automation business where we saw weakness, but it was - in China it was more broad based, a lot of the businesses were down a bit.","So, again, it was a difficult comp, and I think they're just dealing with the uncertainty and a trade war, and we've been watching it closely, and it's 7% of our business. And fortunately, we have about 80% of our business growing mid single digit. So it's been inconsistent, that's the best way to describe it, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Yes. No, of course. And just a broader question, I think, others have tried to sort of get to the question. If I look at your peers, most of them actually did cut organic growth outlook. If I look at the historical relationship between your revenue growth and industrial production, your guidance does imply that things are different. You did highlight more North American acquisitions over the past couple of years.","But could you also talk about the impact of the growth initiatives, because I know Dave, when we meet with AMETEK folks, they're really highlighting, how are you pivoting more to growth. Anyway you can quantify what the growth initiatives doing to cyclicality of the growth profile of AMETEK, that will be terrific? Thank you.","David Zapico","Yes, sure. When I think about our portfolio, we had the U.S.-based acquisitions over the past year, but we also have about 13% of our business now is health care. And our aerospace business is performing well. So those are all things that are driving us right now. And when I look at the -- we definitely have improved our organic growth capability.","We're making great progress as you saw when you visited some of our operation. There is -- the teams are excited and we're seeing positive results. But I don't think that, that is very difficult to quantify that. And we will be using the tools and the way we have talked about it is through the cycle we will get a point better of organic growth. So I'm not sure in the current environment. It's pretty -- you can draw a distinction between what we've done in organic growth and the current results.","Andrew Obin","Terrific. Thank you very much.","David Zapico","Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","David Zapico","Hello, Deane.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, maybe we can start with price cost in the quarter. How did that play out in expectations for the second half and what role tariffs had?","David Zapico","Great. Yes, I think, I'll start with the tariffs. And as you know, we're comprised of niche differentiated businesses and we have low CapEx by design. So our model gives us a lot of flexibility in dealing with those situations.","And in Q2, the situation played out as we predicted. We had about $0.01 from the direct impact of tariffs and we offset that completely with price. So -- and we're expecting a similar level of activity in the second half of the year.","And going back to the price question, Q2 '19 was much like the second half of '18, and the first quarter of '19. We had an excellent quarter. We achieved 2% of price across our entire business, that's both in EIG and EMG.","Total inflation and the impact of tariffs added together was a bit less than 1.5%. So, we had a good contribution to margin from our price less total inflation and tariffs and we're very pleased with the results.","Deane Dray","It's all great to hear. And then in the verticals and the end markets, did I hear you comment on oil and gas? How did that...","David Zapico","No, we didn't -- yes, we didn't comment. Oil and gas had a particularly strong quarter in Europe, and we include the Middle East in Europe. And when you look at the whole segment, it was up 10% in Q2. So, good strong organic growth in both our upstream and mid and downstream businesses, and we were pleased with the performance.","Deane Dray","Good. And then on the opening question, I might have -- with Matt, I might have missed the answer, he asked about how July had looked?","David Zapico","Right. Yes, I don't think - yes, we covered the quarter. We talked about the quarter being -- and increased each month, but it was more subdued for us. And in July, we're right on our plan, so July isn't over, but we're on target. So July feels pretty good.","Deane Dray","All good to hear. Thank you.","David Zapico","Thank you, Deane.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.","David Zapico","Hello, Rob.","Robert McCarthy","Can you hear me?","David Zapico","Yes.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks for the time, and congratulations on a good quarter. I guess the first question I would have is around your incremental margins. On a core basis, could you talk through that, just excluding acquisition and some of the distortions we might see there?","William Burke","Right. We're very pleased with our margin performance in the quarter. Our core margins were excellent. The EIG, if you take out the acquisitions, it was up 90 basis points, and EMG, where there wasn't acquisitions was up 120 basis points.","So just outstanding margins, outstanding operating performance, and it showed up in the incrementals also. We had core incrementals of about 60%, EIG was about 50% and EMG was about 70%. So excellent operating performance around the world.","Robert McCarthy","Now, definitely, could you speak just stepping back on the performance on the cash cycle and cash generation in more of your aerospace, and while you probably have very little explicit defense exposure.","But your aerospace and longer cycle businesses in terms of how you do there, in terms of free cash flow generation conversion or operating cash flow typically, is that below or above the company average?","David Zapico","Yes. The aerospace business is a great cash generator for us. So, I would say, it's - in terms of the various components of working capital, aerospace ends up being a little higher as a percentage of sales because they're dealing with the aftermarket and -- but they are higher margin businesses. So you have higher working capital, but higher margins, and that's characteristic of the aerospace business, and it's been that way for a long time.","Robert McCarthy","Yes, it's nice to have a good cash generation. The final question is just looking at the environment you're seeing right now, obviously went through a kind of a rocky road and kind of the '14 to '16 time frame with deflation, oil and gas kind of contraction, and it led to some challenging organic growth and also some restructuring, right? Do you think we're going to anticipate given what we're seeing right now over the next 12 months to 18 months incremental restructuring from you guys?","David Zapico","At AMETEK, we are in our various businesses. We're always doing some level of restructuring and those are reported in the operating results. In terms of our big restructuring, our realignment activity affected the entire company.","Right now we're not seeing that, we're pretty confident around the second half of the year. But if things change, then we're good at doing it, and we have plenty of opportunities to drive cost reduction.","So, as I sit here with a solid group of businesses, generating cash flow, margin expansion, with a robust backlog of deals, with a strong balance sheet, I feel very optimistic about AMETEK's performance and being able to outperform the current environment.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks for your time.","David Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research.","Brett Linzey","Hey, good morning, guys.","David Zapico","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Linzey","Hey, just a question pertaining to some of the recent portfolio moves, if -- and in recent, I mean, you know, 2017, 2018 acquisitions, if we were to drill down and look at the recurring element or the aftermarket element as a percent of sales of those businesses, how does that mix look of those acquired assets versus the legacy portfolio? You're actually mixing up with the stickier revenue base\u2026","David Zapico","Yes, we are mixing up, and when we announced those deals, we address the recurring revenue, you know Telular stands out. It is about two-thirds of the business that's recurring, but many of the businesses like Spectro Scientific was 30%, 40%, and so we're mixing up and the recurring baseline of AMETEK, it was about 20%, but our recent acquisitions have been a bit more than that.","Brett Linzey","Okay. Great. And then if we continue to see this industrial slowdown, historically you've talked about incrementals on the way up of 30% to 35%. If we flip that script and think about potential downside what type of decremental preservation do you see if we get into an environment where sales are declining modestly?","And then I guess a follow-on there, are there any countermeasure plans in place that can help you get a cost relatively quickly if things do turn a little bit south here?","David Zapico","Right. Yes, as you know, we have high contribution margins in our business, very profitable businesses, but we also have excellent operating capability, and we have seasoned general managers that know how to operate both in up cycles and down cycles.","And clearly going into a down cycle, we have plenty of opportunities and plenty of projects, and we have the ability to pull those forward, and we're also very good at managing our working capital and generate a lot of cash.","So if we get into that environment, it's an environment where we're experienced and we will perform well on a relative basis, but right at this point we're not seeing that.","Brett Linzey","But based on some of those actions or what's been in motion, I mean do you think you can preserve a decremental margin much less than 30%?","David Zapico","Yes. I think it's definitely, but again when something like that happens, it depends on where it comes from and...","William Burke","The depth of it.","David Zapico","And the depth of degrowth is a good comment. So we have to look at it. If that happens when it comes, and I'm sure there will be another recession and I'm sure we'll manage our way through very well.","Brett Linzey","Okay. Great, guys. Thanks.","David Zapico","Thanks, Brent.","Operator","Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.","Allison Poliniak","Hi, guys. Good morning.","David Zapico","Good morning, Allison.","Allison Poliniak","Just want to follow along on that operational excellence kind of theme. You did increase your operation excellence savings for 2019. Can you talk with just sort of a natural fallout of where some of these programs ended or ending or is it some acceleration in certain areas?","David Zapico","We're seeing acceleration. I mean the -- at the beginning of the year, we had about $80 million of operational excellence savings, and $60 million of it was from sourcing, and $20 million of it was from other projects that we had. And what we're really seeing is an acceleration on the sourcing side. So our sourcing teams are doing an outstanding job, absolutely outstanding job of dealing with the mitigation of tariffs, and moving us to different regions of the world and delivering incremental savings.","So really the incremental savings from sourcing was increased from $60 million to $65 million, and that drove the operational excellence savings increase from $80 million to $85 million. And that savings are in the P&L for 2019 and we saw -- that's a ratable kind of thing, and we saw it ramp up from Q1 to Q2, so we're very confident in the second half of that.","Allison Poliniak","Great. And then I may have missed it, the aerospace increase in growth for that sector. Was there a specific sub segment there or region that's driving that increased growth relative to your expectations?","David Zapico","Yes, we have a -- if you look at the business jet market, the business jet market was up low double digits, and coming off a pretty easy comp, but it's continuing to perform. So the military market, the third-party MRO had a fantastic quarter in the second quarter, the commercial business continued strong, so it was really the entire market that did well. But if you look into the details, the business jet market ticked up and we improved the guidance for that for the year. But the entire aerospace business, we increased mid to high single digits.","Allison Poliniak","Great. Thanks so much.","David Zapico","Thanks, Allison.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you. Good morning.","David Zapico","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Glynn","Hey, Dave. So I think you mentioned $2 billion cash and available credit. I think it's the first quarter in a little while you didn't talk about a couple of new bolt-ons, I know. They don't come every quarter, but just an update, is the pipeline still very vibrant?","David Zapico","It is. It is. You know, Chris, we had a record Q4 2018, where we closed three deals and spent about $750 million. And our pipeline is very good, and we're evaluating a number of opportunities. And as you know, it's difficult to predict when they're going to happen in the short-term, but I feel very confident in the long-term and our capability in this area, and have a strong balance sheet. So we're very optimistic that we're going to be able to deploy our free cash flow on acquisitions in the long-term. Right now, we're being disciplined. I mean, we're looking at a lot of properties, and we do deal, we're going to get you return on capital.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks for that. And on the outlook, generally calling for continuity versus the macros clearly weakening, I understand you don't have much distribution, you're much more direct. So that's clearly an advantage you have in the current environment. But are we moving into a phase where backlog conversion picks up to kind of preserve that organic continuity? Just want a little more kind of complexion around that.","David Zapico","Yes, we have a near-record backlog of $1.7 billion, which gives us some confidence in the second half. And if you look into that backlog, there are some opportunities to convert some of it. So that's one of the reasons that we're confident in the guidance in the second half. We're performing well, we got our aerospace growth, our process business is doing well, the U.S. market has done extremely well, and we got a solid backlog and that provides conversion opportunities. So that's the way we're looking at it and we feel good about it.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. Thanks for that.","David Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Hey, guys, good morning.","David Zapico","Hey, Joe.","Joe Giordano","Hey, Bill, just one quick clarification. The tax rate was a little light in the quarter, anything specific going on there? And I know you gave the full year, but I missed it. What's your view for that?","William Burke","Full year is now 21%. What we saw in the quarter was about 150 basis points down year-over-year. Benefits from -- excess tax benefits from stock compensation, and as well there was some changes in some state tax laws that help us drive that rate down to 20.4% in the second quarter.","Joe Giordano","And 21% good forward number to use like out into the model, too?","William Burke","We're looking at a number that's probably to get to the average of 21% for the year, it's more of 22% in the back half of the year.","Joe Giordano","I mean more so like a full year going forward like into 2020, is like a 21% a fair number to use?","William Burke","That's -- we'll be working to get to that level next year.","Joe Giordano","Okay. So we've kind of got through this a couple of times, asked different ways. As top line starts to slow a bit maybe we're -- we're still in the same organic range, but maybe we're talking more midpoint or lower, and early in the year, maybe we're talking midpoint or higher. Particularly in markets like maybe heavy truck where there is some obvious declines probably coming up, are you like teeing up anything here to take some actions? And along the same lines, your cost out this year really strong sourcing accelerating, what's the opportunity set look like into next year for your cost out broadly?","David Zapico","Right. The opportunity set is very good to -- at all times. As part of our strategic planning process, we go through with all of our business. They have a three-year plan for cost reductions, and involve sourcing some plant consolidations and everything. We have a viable set of projects to pull from. So we really have some opportunities to do that. But when you mention the trucking marker, that business is now less than 2% of sales and the mix...","William Burke","Definitely, yes.","David Zapico","Yes, we bought Motec earlier in the year and they are in the really good business, and that business is actually growing. So it mutes any decline that we have in the other part of the business. So we have a situation where we've been modifying our portfolio over time, and there we have a good growth. And the camera and the algorithms, software of the vehicles, and really it has changed the outlook for that part of the business.","So, you have a little bit of portfolio work that's going on, and we still feel good for the second half. I mean your point is valid maybe for more toward the midpoint and\/or the low end and high end, but we're at 4% through the half year, right in the middle of our guide, and we feel confident for the second half of the year.","Joe Giordano","So, I guess, what I'm getting at -- I know that you're not -- I know that you're looking forward, and you're not sitting on your hands as things start to weaken from a macros perspective. Earlier in the year, orders growing 12% organically, or like last year orders growing 12% organically in the first quarter, and now we're at flat. So how are you just -- I'm guessing like the decisions are somewhat different now. So how are you acting differently than maybe you were a year ago or something like that?","David Zapico","Yes, I just point you to margins. And we really have some seasoned operators in our businesses, and they are reacting to their plan. So when their business has softened, they're adjusting their cost structures. And with our -- you saw excellent core incrementals in the quarter, you saw excellent operating income. On a reported basis, we are up 60 basis points after we did a bunch of dilutive deals. And without the acquisitions, we were at 110 basis points. So I think the AMETEK operational excellence is really working for you, and there is plenty of room to go and a long runway to that.","Joe Giordano","Great. Thanks, guys.","David Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","And I'm not showing any further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to our host.","David Zapico","Great.

I'll now turn the meeting over to Frank","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a solid third quarter with strong operating performance and earnings growth. We delivered a record level of earnings at the high end of our guidance range despite what remains a challenging and slow growth global environment. Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references to 2014 financial results will be on an adjusted basis excluding the Zygo integration costs from the third and fourth quarter of 2014.","Now on to the results. Sales in the quarter were $998.5 million, down 3% from last year's third quarter. Organic sales declined 2%, foreign currency was a 4-point headwind and acquisitions added 2%. Operating income for the third quarter increased 3% to $237.6 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was excellent at 23.8%, up 130 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2014. Net income increased 3% to a record $156.4 million and diluted earnings per share were up 5% over last year's third quarter to a record $0.65 per diluted share.","Turning to our individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a good quarter with solid operating performance. Sales were $598.5 million in the quarter, down 5% from last year's third quarter. The lower sales were driven by a 3% foreign currency headwind. Organic sales declined 2% as a result of the as expected weakness in our upstream Oil & Gas business. EIG's operating income was $162.5 million, up slightly from last year's third quarter. Operating margins were very strong, up 160 basis points to 27.2%.","The Electromechanical Group also had a good quarter with excellent operating performance. Sales were flat for the quarter at $400 million as strong core growth in our Aerospace businesses and the contributions from the acquisition of Global Tubes were offset by foreign currency headwinds and weakness within our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. Organic sales were down 2%. Foreign currency was a 4% headwind and acquisitions added 6%. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $86.7 million and operating margins were very strong at 21.7%, up 120 basis points from last year's third quarter.","Now, turning to our Four Growth Strategies of: Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion; New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on New Product Development. We continue to see great results from our New Product Development efforts. Our businesses are doing a tremendous job developing new highly-differentiated products to serve both their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets. We are consistently growing our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are effectively and efficiently developing the right products to serve our customers.","One example of this investment is within our Indian R&D Center of Excellence which we developed a number of years ago to help our businesses globalize their R&D efforts and capitalize on the strong engineering talent within India. The success and growth of this effort has been tremendous. We now have over 120 talented engineers in India with more than half of our business units having local R&D talent there. We expect continued expansion of these R&D efforts.","Overall, in 2015, we expect to spend approximately $210 million or about 5% of our sales on RD&E. And some new product introductions, I'll start, our EDAX business unit, a leader in microanalysis and micro-XRF systems has added its state of the art EDS system offering with the introduction of the next generation Octane Elite Series. The next-gen Octane Elite offers new to the world differentiated features that benefit our customers, including thermal, corrosion, and shock resistance, increased sensitivity to X-rays, and high speed X-ray data processing capabilities in a much smaller footprint.","Our Programmable Power business, the global leader in programmable AC and DC power test solutions, expanded its line of stand-alone photovoltaic simulators with their newest product, the Embedded TerraSAS. The TerraSAS was specifically developed to test solar energy microgrids by mimicking the behavior of ground-based solar energy arrays. The new simulator allows for a 50% increase in output power over our existing offering and now spans a range from 5 kilowatts to 15 kilowatts of power and you can put multiple simulators together paralleled up to support solar array installations up to 500 kilowatts of power. So very high power capability.","And lastly, our Reichert technology business, a pioneer and leader in the development of vision diagnostic devices, launched its most advanced Ocular Response Analyzer, the G3, during the quarter. The new analyzer is the only tonometer capable of measuring cornea hysteresis which is a strong predictor of glaucoma progression and also provides a better indication of true eye pressure than other methods of tonometry. The analyzer was designed to provide a more streamlined product and better user experience.","From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was very strong at 24% of sales in the quarter, up from 23% in last year's third quarter.","Now turning to Global & Market Expansion, we will continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channel, service infrastructure and manufacturing footprint in emerging markets to capitalize on the attractive long-term growth opportunities. In the third quarter of 2015, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. We saw very strong growth in our Aerospace businesses in both Europe and Asia during the quarter. Combined, our Aerospace businesses grew double-digits organically in international markets as a result of strong shipments to support the production ramp-up of the A320neo and A350 commercial aircraft as well as the Joint Strike Fighter military aircraft.","Now, turning to acquisitions. We continue to see great success with our acquisition strategy. Thus far in 2015, we've completed two deals deploying approximately $360 million in capital. And we acquired nearly $180 million in revenue. Over the last 24 months, we've completed nine acquisitions, deployed approximately $1.2 billion in capital, and acquired approximately $600 million in revenue. Our most recent acquisition, Surface Vision, was completed in the third quarter. Surface Vision develops and manufactures software-enabled vision systems to inspect the surfaces of continuously-processed materials for flaws and defects.","The business' proprietary high-speed defect-recognition technology detects, classifies and accurately maps specific defects over the entire area of the surface. The business is an excellent strategic acquisition for AMETEK as it expands our presence in the non-destructive process inspection market. And in addition, Surface Vision will be able to leverage a number of AMETEK's complementary technologies and products within its Visions systems. Surface Vision is headquartered in Hayward, California, and has annual sales of approximately $60 million. And the integration of this particular deal is going well and we're very excited to have the Surface Vision team now as part of AMETEK.","Our business unit and M&A teams continue to manage a very active pipeline of attractive opportunities and acquisitions will continue to be a focus for AMETEK and the primary use of our strong cash flow.","I'll touch on our last strategy, Operational Excellence. Our team continues to deliver excellent operating performance through the use of our various Operational Excellence tools. In low-growth environments, the success of our Operational Excellence initiatives takes on even greater importance so we are able to continue to drive meaningful margin expansion while allowing us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall in 2015, we now anticipate approximately $150 million of Operational Excellence savings, with the largest contributor to this savings, being our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, which we expect approximately $75 million in savings in 2015.","Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. As noted, the global environment remains challenging. We're seeing sluggish conditions across many of our markets and geographies. And we expect the sluggishness to continue for the remainder of the year. Therefore, for all of 2015, we expect both overall and organic sales to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be approximately $2.55, up 5% over 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 sales are expected to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from last year's fourth quarter, with organic growth down low single digits. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.63 per diluted share in the fourth quarter.","So in summary, I'm pleased with our results this quarter given the difficult market conditions. We delivered excellent operating performance and record earnings while continuing to make long term investments across each of our growth strategies.","I'd like to take this time to acknowledge the great work by all AMETEK employees in helping drive these strong results and for their commitment to driving each of AMETEK's growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy.","Bob will now cover some of the financial details and then we'll be glad to take your questions.","Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a solid third quarter with good operating results. I will provide some further details.","In the quarter, total selling expenses were down more than total sales on a percentage basis, due to good cost containment. General and administrative expenses were 1.1% of sales in the quarter, down from last year's third quarter level of 1.2% of sales. Other expense in the quarter was lower in comparison to last year's third quarter as a result of higher expense due to a one-time insurance write-off in last year's third quarter.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.1%, up from 25.1% in last year's quarter. For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 27.5% as a result of our ongoing international and state tax planning. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.","On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.2% of sales in the third quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $19 million for the quarter. Full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $38 million for the quarter and 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million.","Operating cash flow was $188 million in the third quarter. And free cash flow was $168 million, or 108% of net income in the quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow, excluding the $50 million pension contribution made in the first quarter, to be approximately 110% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In the third quarter, we deployed approximately $160 million for the acquisition of Surface Vision. Year-to-date, we've deployed approximately $360 million on acquisitions. And over the last 24 months, we have deployed $1.2 billion in capital. In addition, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of stock for approximately $250 million.","Total debt was $1.92 billion at September 30, up $200 million from the 2014 year-end. This amount reflects the third funding from the Private Placement Agreement we entered into last September. This funding was $150 million, was received on August 14 and was used to pay down term debt which matured in the quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $328 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 32.4%. At September 30, we had approximately $950 million of cash in existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives.","In summary, we had a strong third quarter. We are well positioned for future growth with a strong balance sheet and cash flow.","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Bob. Operator, we'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. And our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Allison.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Could you talk, Frank, a little bit about the deceleration, what was different from even last quarter that drove this Q4 a little bit weaker than you maybe anticipated?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure, Allison. In essence, when you look across the company, EIG performed in line with our expectations. We saw in EMG that the combination of Aerospace which was very strong was offset to a larger degree than we had anticipated in our Engineered Materials Interconnects & Packaging business. And the net of that ended up with in the third quarter a minus 2% organic growth for EMG. And we believe that that is going to continue in the fourth quarter. So we are seeing the result of the, I'll call it, industrial recession that's being talked about substantially now. And we decided as a result that the fourth quarter, which also was very strong from the viewpoint of expectation, needed to be lowered a bit.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then just obviously acquisitions, you've been very active over the last 24 months. Can you give us somewhat of an update, how they're progressing? Obviously, the macro environment is certainly a large headwind here, but in terms of your expectations going into them, both on a revenue and maybe a profit side as well?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, we're pretty bullish on the acquisition environment. We're working on a number of deals. Without giving specifics, I can tell you that in the third quarter, we worked on a very large deal actually. It would have been the largest deal that AMETEK has ever done. But unfortunately or I guess fortunately, depending on how you look at it, we did find a contingent liability in that deal that caused us to basically not continue with that deal.","Putting that aside, we are in due diligence right now on other deals. We feel good about it. As we mentioned, it's the primary use of our cash flow. It's difficult to predict when deals will close. But you're going to be hearing from us either this quarter or surely in the first quarter of next year with additional deals.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Matt.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just a quick clarification. There was no M&A contribution in EIG. And I thought the Surface Vision deal closed within the first few weeks of the quarter. So, could you clarify when that will be hitting your results?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No. Actually, what occurred there is that Surface Vision was in the quarter. If you go back a year to when we did the Zygo acquisition in the third quarter of 2014, we actually had a stub period for that business because we acquired it right at the end of Q2 of last year. So that when you do the comparison between acquisitions this year in Q3 versus last year, you get an abnormality. In reality, in the quarter, we saw approximately $15 million of sales from Surface Vision, which was countered by basically that stub period. So, that's a good pickup, Matt.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. Okay, great. That helps. So, just to kind of follow up on the end market question. Did you say Oil & Gas was kind of expected through the quarter? And it seems like just based on the magnitude of the deceleration, maybe it was more than just EMIP. So, anything besides that in the Process side that's coming in weaker than expected or just this industrial malaise is touching most of your businesses, it seems? Any change in Oil & Gas specifically?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. We had given an estimate in Oil & Gas back in the first quarter. We said that our total exposure was around $400 million. And we expected about a 10% reduction in that due to the upstream portion which was around $40 million and, in fact, that's what we're seeing. We called it right. Our people did a really good job of estimating what the impact would be. And therefore, on the EIG side, we have not changed our outlook based on Oil & Gas, and it really performed, as I said in my opening remarks, in line with expectation.","The difference was there's obviously a global macro condition here that is having impact on a number of businesses, but when you really isolate the change in EMG, it did come down to our Aerospace businesses, which did very well, being offset by weakness in our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. And when we look at that Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business, it is really a global macro that is driving that. It's not a specific item, et cetera. It's just the global macro condition. So, that is the area of the company that we've seen an impact due to the industrial recession, for lack of a better set of words. Does that help?","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, it does. Thanks very much.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Matt.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Joe Radigan with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Joe.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Frank, coming into the year, I think you were expecting or at least you guided to about 30 basis points to 40 basis points of margin improvement, which was consistent with what you've seen in the last few years. You're trending, I think, basically 100 basis points up year-over-year through three quarters. It sounds like that's going to continue into the fourth quarter. So, I guess my question is, obviously, you guys know what you're doing in terms of cost management, but as we look at this sort of slow growth going forward, can you continue to get margin expansion, or does the shift focus to more just sustaining where you're at in this industrial recession type environment?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great question, Joe. No, we're pretty bullish on margins. And you're absolutely right that we started the year with a lower number. But you may recall in the first quarter, we took some specific actions when we realized that the year was going to be weak, as most industrial companies were seeing. So, as a result, our guidance has been in the 100-basis-point arena, and that's what we're expecting for the entire year, that we're going to be up about 100 basis points.","As we go into next year, which, really, was the key part of your question, we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business. And one advantage of our MIP (26:30) strategy is that there are a lot of actions that we can take to basically improve the operating performance by putting various manufacturing facilities together, being more aggressive in the materials side of the business which, as you know, we've put tremendous infrastructure in place that we can continue to drive good earnings growth there. We've got value analysis and value engineering which is picking up steam in the company. So, we are in the process right now of putting our budgets together for next year.","I'm not prepared to give you an exact number. We will do that in the January or, I guess, maybe early February call, whenever we're going to have it in the beginning of the year, and we'll give you guidance. But I can tell you, margins will be up. No questions asked.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, can you give us a rundown by region, kind of what you saw by region?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure. If you look at our performance in the main geographic areas, the U.S. was flat. This is all organic. Asia was down 7% and Europe was down about 1%. So Asia, if you look at the change when you go back in time, we were growing our Asia business in the double-digit positive arena. And now, we're seeing obviously the effects of what's going on, principally in China. And the organic growth in China in Q3 was actually a negative 12%, and that compared with last year's third quarter when we were up 17%. So, very significant change in China. And then, just sort of a slower growth in the other parts of the world, Europe is hanging in there. Probably a little bit better than we had expected.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Frank.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Joe.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Yes. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Just a question on growth. With the latest guidance, EPS growth is now likely to come in at sort of mid-single digits, and this is \u2013 even if we exclude 2009, this is the lowest level in a decade. And from your perspective, what can get EPS growth to reaccelerate in the near-term?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. First of all, I mean, if you go back \u2013 you said a decade. If you go back to 2008 and 2009, when we were in the recession, we surely had \u2013 our earnings growth was negative. The key part of how we're going to get the numbers up is it's basically going to come down doing more deals, using that strong cash flow to acquire companies.","And, obviously, we look at that on a return-on-invested-capital viewpoint, but that will also drive EPS growth. And then, we've been very careful as we've made the cost reductions in the company to focus on the operations side of the business, not on our engineering and sales and distribution side of the business. And that's \u2013 you heard me in my opening remarks talk substantially to that.","So, we're going to continue. And with those engineering efforts, we're hoping that we'll be able to offset some of the effects of the global macro. So, the basic answer to your question is to get better organic growth and do deals. That's the key. And we'll continue, as we always have. It's sort of the hallmark of AMETEK to continue to do cost improvements across the business. So, those are the drivers, and that's why, as I mentioned to Joe's question, that I think we're going to see margin improvement. And you're not seeing many industrial companies right now showing double-digit EPS growth.","Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","No. And are you guys seeing \u2013 just a follow-up question. So, A, if I understood you correctly, so high R&D and investment, just ability to take share in the stuff environment. Is that what I've heard?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. That's what you heard.","Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","And just a follow-up question, are you guys seeing any headwinds or changes in demand in aerospace, and particularly in bizjets?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. We have a very good story in bizjets. And it is not because of the market. The market is kind of bouncing along bottom. Maybe you're hearing a little bit of uptick in the market, but we've been very successful in putting new content on a number of the new airplanes. We're on the HondaJet for example. We do a lot in helicopters which we put in this business jet arena. And actually, orders for our business jets in the third quarter were up 30%.","Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Wow.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, But again, it's not because of the market. The commercial side of the business, it's a different story where there we are seeing a market, I guess, tailwind to use a pun, where those market conditions are definitely better than business and regional jet. And at some point, we think the business in regional jet market will turn; it always does. People have been predicting that upturn for a number of years and it hasn't happened. So, we decided just to get very aggressive in terms of new products on the newer aircraft. And our team has done a great job and that's why we're growing so well.","Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Andrew.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors","Hey, Frank. A couple questions. First, just to put this into context, can you talk about, first, what your organic order number looked like in the quarter and what the organic book-to-bill would have been? And then talk about the linearity you experienced. I guess, I'm trying to all put this into context. I've obviously been familiar with AMETEK for a while now. Typically, the fourth quarter is your best EPS quarter of the year. Are you really just trying to derisk that going to $0.63? It's been quite a while since you've had a Q4 less than what you've earned really throughout the prior part of the year. I'm just trying to put all of this together.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Matt. Well, you asked a number of questions there. Let me see if I can answer each of those. Yes, I'll say we definitely derisked the fourth quarter. We just felt with the global macro that we're seeing and the changes that I've already talked about that we just decided to essentially derisk it. And we're going to obviously concentrate in Q4 on getting good results for the following year. So, as you say, you've known us for many, many years and we definitely did derisk it.","The order numbers, overall orders were down about 2% in the quarter. Organically, they were actually down 5%, but that number is not a fair representation of the business. And the reason is that last year in that quarter, we had some very large one-off orders. So, I think if you normalize that out, the organic growth was in line with, or lack thereof, was in line with the sales growth. So, I think you put that whole picture together, you see a slowing macro. We just decided that we were going to derisk Q4.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors","And then just to revisit the China question. I think you said you were up 17% last year, down 12% this year. While I get the comp could give you those (35:26) that's actually a pretty surprising number to me. Can you talk about from an end-market standpoint more of what you're seeing there? And I realize it's not a gigantic part of your sales, just more of trying to get a bigger picture of what's going on there. That's a big decline.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. You were breaking up there. I think I got your question. So actually, this is not a change. Last quarter, I don't remember the exact number, but it was in that \u2013 it was negative 5%, one of the guys is telling me. So, there really hasn't been a major change in our outlook there. I mean, basically, you're looking at a situation in China that is a basic change. You look at the PMI in China. I was just reading a report actually last night. The latest PMI came out at 47% for China when it was running at close to 60%. So, there just has been a change in the industrial environment in China.","So, I don't think it's a major change sort of sequentially in Asia, but clearly it is a major driver in our organic growth. The other thing, I said minus 7% and minus 5%, those numbers were for all of Asia, okay? The minus 12% in China was offset by strong performance in Japan actually last quarter and this quarter. And also, some of the other parts of Asia are doing much better. But the drag is definitely China.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors","Thank you.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You bet, Matt.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Frank, you had mentioned the EIG business with core growth was down about 2%. You had suggested that that was at plan. Is that...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, that \u2013 not our original plan but at our forecast. If you look \u2013 let's just take EIG and segment this, so you have a flavor as to what is actually going on here.","Our Aerospace businesses in EIG were very good. They were up mid-single digits in the quarter on sales and orders, actually. So that part of EIG performed as we had anticipated. You look at the Power & Industrial piece of EIG, that was up low-single digits which was our expectation. The drag was in Process where that was down low-single digits and because Process is a larger part of EIG, that drove that negative 2% overall organic growth.","And yes, that's basically what we said last quarter when we provided the outlook. We said that the organic growth for EIG for the entire year was going to be basically flat, and that's what we're predicting now. So there hasn't been what I would call a major change in EIG. It's been pretty much as we anticipated. And the issue is very simple there, it's Oil & Gas. That's what's driving it and it's the upstream piece.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then so...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Does that help?","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And so fourth quarter then, core growth could be flattish or so?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're saying low single digits negative.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","For EIG as well. Okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then can I also \u2013 I guess \u2013 maybe I just \u2013 I don't understand the comment that you made about Zygo stub period impacting the revenue contribution from SISD. I mean, if you closed SISD in early July, the acquisition contribution in revenue should be reflected there. I don't understand the Zygo offset comment. I mean, was there \u2013 was it just \u2013 was there a deferred revenue issue with SISD?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, no, no.","Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, no.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, no. Bob, why don't you explain?","Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, the issue was that we closed Zygo at the very end of the second quarter of last year. And therefore, some of the sales were reflected in the third quarter of 2014. So, the first period of reporting for Zygo really was the third quarter of last year. And it had the last, say, 10 days or so of the second quarter sales after acquisition that showed up in the third quarter.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, when you do the comparison, Rick, what basically happens is we got, as you indicated, $12 million to $15 million of revenue from Surface Vision. But what we're talking about is when you compare it to Q3 of last year, we had the same amount from that stub period, so you end up with, quarter over quarter, no acquisition growth. But if you just look at it on an absolute basis, you're absolutely right that we saw the roughly $15 million of volume from Surface Vision in Q3 of this year. Does that all make sense now?","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","No, it doesn't.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No?","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I'll follow up with Kevin, but I -","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, why don't you follow up with Kevin.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","If there's revenue coming in, there's revenue coming in. And then the other question that I had was just, Frank, in the past week, we've looked at the EMIP business as somewhat of a leading indicator for global macro and for your overall businesses. And I think, if I'm not mistaken, EMIP has some exposure to the Aerospace markets as well. So, how do you reconcile the drastic slowdown in EMIP with your forecast going forward?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think \u2013 first, let me comment on what's the early indicator. The early indicator is actually our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business. We have always used that as an indicator of the global macro. And in fact, that did slow as well. But EMIP, because it's a larger part of the organization, it had a more significant impact. And, yes, there is some Aerospace in there, which actually did quite well, but it's a small part of that overall operation. So that when you see the reduction and put that across the entire EMG, basically all of Aerospace, not just in EMIP, but all of Aerospace in that differentiated part of EMG was basically more than compensated for by the shortfall in EMIP. And, therefore, the total organic growth was down this 1% or 2%. So yeah, okay?","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Frank, got a question about how things trended from earlier in the quarter through September and into October. And, I guess, there's a quantitative aspect to the question. But on a qualitative side, do you feel like the reset on the macro is in or is that a question for another day?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Say that again? Is the...","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Just wondering how things tailed up during the quarter if you compare the early part of the quarter to September and into October. And do you feel like the reset in the macro is in place or is that a question for another day?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Yeah. No. No. I feel it's in place and, actually, if you'll look at the order trend in the quarter, it was actually up from the beginning of Q3 to the end of Q3. But the absolute levels were lower than we had anticipated. And, yes, I think we have taken the global macro now into account and we dealt with through the costs and we're looking at now what next year is going to look like. I'm not looking at further deterioration. I don't feel that. But I do feel like, as I said before, the target for the fourth quarter was a very high one. And you look at numbers that were up in the $0.68, $0.69 region. And with this global macro, you couldn't make that ramp. It's just too big a ramp.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.

(Broker)","You feel like there's a good read on the macro from where you sit right now?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I feel there's a good read on the macro now. Yes. Absolutely.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Frank, no more questions on Zygo. I think I get it.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. We're good.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just I thought your 4Q comments were interesting in terms of you derisked the 4Q guidance. So, just want to clarify that. So, based on prior years, there should be, what, $0.02 or $0.03 of contingency based on your plan?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There's contingency. There's definitely contingency. So, I'm not going to speak to the amount. But if things go well, we'll beat that number.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And clearly, Oil & Gas took a toll on the Process performance. You've said in the past, upstream very weak but midstream, downstream \u2013 I wouldn't say good but holding the line. What is your current commentary on midstream and downstream and how do you think that looks in 2016 (46:04)?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Great question, Nigel. There has been no change. What we said at the beginning of the year is the upstream piece was going to be down about 25%, and the mid and downstream piece would be down slightly, low-single digits. And that's in fact what we're seeing. The mid and downstream is holding in there and we have not seen a deceleration in that piece of the business. I know there was some concern a quarter or two ago, of whether we were going to see that. And in fact, we have not seen it. So the impact on us is largely the upstream part of the business and it's down about what we had expected.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just finally, Frank, pricing has been pretty strong year-to-date. Have you seen any deterioration in pricing given the weakening macro?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just a little bit. We have been talking numbers on pricing, I think the first few quarters of the year at about 1.5%. And when we rolled up Q3, it came in about 1.3%. But that's sort of a normal variation. So, I don't think there's been a deceleration. But it's not the 2% that we were seeing a number of years ago. And very few industrial companies are seeing a 2% number. So, we're actually fairly happy with staying around that 1.5% level.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much, Frank.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Nigel.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I know Nigel might get it, I'm actually still pretty confused about the M&A, but I'll take it offline. It almost seems to me like maybe organic is being overstated the way it's being discussed, but...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, no, not at all. Not at all, yeah. I think this stuff here is what confuses you. If you're just looking at absolute numbers, there was $15 million of acquisition growth. If you look at it that way. It's only when you compare it to the third quarter of last year does it cause the confusion, and that's the way we typically talk about acquisition growth is on a comparison basis. So, it really just depends how you look at it. There's nothing strange going on here. It's just the way you look at it.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. I'll follow up with Kevin after. Just separately, most of my questions have been answered. But maybe just talk to free cash flow conversation. So, you took it down a little bit and I think you were previously 115%, now you're 110%, CapEx has taken down a little bit. Maybe just talk about the puts and takes there. Is it maybe a little bit on working capital that you're not getting out is what you thought, or are there items?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. You hit it, Brian. When you see a slowing macro, we did have some working capital buildup. It was not substantial, but it did go up and that was a driver. And we're giving you rough estimates here. I think the 110% is actually conservative. It's going to be better than that. But we did want to be fair in saying that it probably is not going to reach the 115% level.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And do you think the $70 million is \u2013 oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Apologize.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I didn't say anything.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I thought...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think there's some background.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","There's some feedback. Yeah. Just the CapEx at $70 million, so you're confident that it will still be spent, it still assumes do some pickup in the fourth quarter? Flat with last year but obviously you've been trending below?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No. It's definitely possible we'll spend less than that. We dropped it from $75 million to $70 million, and it would not surprise me if we ended up at a $65 million number there.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. All right. Great. Thank you.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey. You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, you mentioned, Frank, that the Engineering Materials and Packaging are the biggest variants from when you last gave guidance. And I was just wondering if there was anything specific on the cost side incremental to what you had already planned or what you typically do as part of your continuous improvement that you've identified over that period that you're going to put through?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No. That's a great question, Joe. What we decided and I think I mentioned this on my last call was that the total cost improvements through the whole company that we talked about last quarter was $145 million. And what we have done is increase that to, I would call it, a conservative number which is $150 million. So definitely, we are active on the cost side of the business and we put additional measures in place, not all in EMIP but obviously that would be a place where some of this would occur. And so yes, the answer to your question is we have taken additional cost actions in the business.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's (51:33)","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And that's why \u2013 if I could just add a comment. That's why when we were asked question about Q3 and derisking it, we really did derisk it given that fact as well.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","So that's a realized $150 million for 2015?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For all \u2013 yes. For all of 2015. A realized number.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then you seem to tee up a question that didn't get asked. You said that the best read was Floorcare & Specialty Motor but, so what's going on there, what are you seeing?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Basically, organic growth down low single digits.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Down low. Okay. And then just last for me, you mentioned the Joint Strike Fighter ramp. Just curious as to any commentary overall on military across the segments.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Military has been a phenomenally good story for us. When you look across the whole company and look at the military part of the business, basically it was up mid single digits. And, yeah, exactly. Some of that is obviously driven by the Joint Strike Fighter but there's also great international military business that we are capitalizing on. So that when you look at the Aerospace segment has been a very positive story for us and a surprise, I would say, in the other direction.","For the full year, we're saying we expect military to be up low single digits because some of the first quarters weren't as strong as this third quarter in military. But it's doing well. It's just doing well. And I guess Congress has come to a budget agreement which could further help this. So we'll see what happens.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great.

I will now turn the meeting over to Frank.","Frank Hermance","","Thanks Kevin, and good morning everyone. AMETEK had a strong third quarter. We established records for sales, operating income, operating margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow.","Sales in the quarter were up 12% to $839.4 million. Internal growth was up 2% and met our expectations, while acquisitions added 12% and currency was a 2% headwind. ","Operating income for the third quarter was superb. It increased 18% to a record $188.2 million, from a $159.6 million last year, reflecting the impact from our operational excellence activities and our longer cycle, higher-margin businesses.","Operating income margin in the quarter was a record 22.4%, a 110 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2011. Net income was up 18% to $115.4 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.47 were up 18% over last year\u2019s third quarter and above the top end of our prior guidance of $0.46. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records.","Operating cash flow in the quarter was superb at $163 million, a 19% increase over the last year\u2019s third quarter. Free cash flow was also very strong at $150 million, or a 130% of net income. Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1 billion. Orders in the third quarter were $800 million, up 10% from the prior year.","Turning our attention to the individual operating groups, the electronic instruments group had a solid third quarter. Sales were up 12% to $457.1 million on strength in our oil and gas, aerospace and power businesses in addition to the contributions from the acquisitions of O\u2019Brien, TMC, EM Test, and Reichert Technologies.","Internal growth was 4%, while acquisitions added 10% to sales and currency reduced sales by 2%. EIG\u2019s operating performance was excellent. Operating income increased 19% to $121.6 million and operating margins were a record 26.6%, up 160 basis points over last year\u2019s third quarter.","The electromechanical group also performed very well in the quarter. Sales were up 12%, to a record $382.3 million on strength in our differentiated businesses and the contributions from the acquisitions of Dunkermotoren. Our cost-driven motors business remained weak in the quarter. For all of EMG internal growth was flat, acquisitions added 14% to sales and foreign currency reduced sales by 2%. EMG\u2019s operating income increased 13% to $77.3 million and operating margins increased 20 basis points to 20.2%.","Focusing now on our four growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development, and acquisitions. Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our continued focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. The results we announced today reflect a tremendous impact of our various operational excellence initiatives as we were able to expand operating margins in the third quarter by 110 basis points to a record 22.4%.","Operational excellence has many facets within AMETEK, including lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factory and back office operations, designed for Six Sigma and our new product development efforts and the movement of product to low-cost locales. We also continued to drive lower costs through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. From these sourcing activities, we recognized approximately $13 (ph) million in savings in the third quarter and expect $48 million in sourcing savings for all of 2012. Overall, we expect $80 million in total cost savings for all of 2012, an increase in the guidance we provided at the end of the second quarter. We are prepared to take further cost actions if necessary.","Moving to our second strategy, global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK\u2019s growth. In the third quarter of 212, international sales represented 52% of our total sales. Growth in Asia and Europe was strong in the quarter. We continue to make investments in global and market expansion initiatives.","The following are some examples of recent successes. AMETEK\u2019s SPECTRO Analytical Instruments business was awarded a number of orders in the BRIC regions in the third quarter. These wins highlight the strength of SPECTRO\u2019s product offering across a variety of market applications as well as SPECTRO\u2019s continuous success in the BRIC regions.","In India, SPECTRO booked an order with the India government for a highly configured SPECTRO lab for the chemical analysis of nine different base metals. The complex analytical requirements could only be fulfilled with our product. In China, a leading oil fuel research institute ordered a SPECTRO XEPOS for trace elemental analysis in crude oil. XEPOS\u2019s excellent sensitivity for the elements of interest was the deciding factor.","AMETEK\u2019s Aerospace and Defense business secured a multimillion dollar order for a thermal management system upgrade for the M1A2 Abrams Tank supplied to the Saudi Arabian armed forces. The environmental control system components we are providing include 5 Hughes-Treitler heat exchangers that will provide crew, vehicle and electronics cooling.","In addition to the initial order, there is a planned option for an additional $1.7 million in products sales in the fourth quarter as well as potential near term sales to other foreign military operations. AMETEK\u2019s Aerospace & Defense business is very well positioned to capture additional foreign military sales.","Moving to our third strategy, new product development is a key to our long term health and growth. We have consistently invested in RD&E. In 2012, we expect to spend $155 million, a 12% increase over 2011. We are excited about some recent new product introductions. AMETEK\u2019s Process & Analytical Instruments business introduced several new products in the third quarter which complement our existing products serving in upstream oil and gas market.","Chandler Engineering introduced two advanced well completion tools. The model 5600 Shear History Simulator, which measures the property of oil and gas well fracturing fluids, and the model 8500 Pressurized Foam Rheometer which measures the properties of oil and gas well drilling foams.","In addition, AMETEK\u2019s Solartron ISA business introduced the Seastream FloCalculator, a subsea flow meter that provides unrivalled accuracy in measuring the output of deep sea oil and gas wells. Also in the third quarter, AMETEK\u2019s Programmable Power Business extended its line of solar array simulators introducing the ETS80, a Photovoltaic Simulator providing industry leading performance to support the fast growing micro PV inverter market.","The simulators are used to validate and test micro and string inverter designs used in commercial, industrial and residential solar energy systems. AMETEK'S proprietary combination of hardware, software and firmware allow the stimulators to emulate a wide range of test protocols in real world operating conditions. The ETS80 complements our existing ETS600 and ETS1000 standalone stimulators for string inverter applications, allowing us to offer a comprehensive family to support Photovoltaic inverter test needs.","From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 21% of sales in the quarter, versus 20% in last year's third quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers.","And finally the fourth strategy of AMETEK is acquisitions. We\u2019ve had a very strong year thus far in 2012. We\u2019ve acquired three highly strategic businesses: O'Brien in the first quarter, Dunkermotoren in the second quarter and Micro-Poise Measurement Systems which we announced this morning.","Micro-Poise is the world's largest and most technologically advanced provider of integrated test and measurement solutions for the tire industry, Micro-Poise products are used by tire manufacturers to test and measure tire quality and to assess potential quality defects. Micro-Poise is the global leader in this niche market with long term relationships with most of the top tire manufacturers. It has a 50% market share, in this niche. ","Micro-Poise was privately held and has annual sales of over approximately 125 million. The price paid was approximately a $170 million. The business is headquartered in Streetsboro, Ohio with additional manufacturing locations in Michigan, Germany and China. Approximately 75% of sales are outside the U.S. and given their sizable installed base of measurement equipment, approximately 35% of total sales are in the aftermarket.","Micro-Poise is an excellent acquisition for us as it further broadens our position in a highly attractive materials test and measurement equipment market. With the acquisition of Micro-Poise, we have acquired $400 million in revenue and deployed approximately $670 million in capital thus far in 2012. Both the acquired revenue and deployed capital are record levels.","Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value, especially given the weakness in the global economy. Our pipeline of deals remain strong with an attractive mix of acquisition candidates with a variety of sizes and markets and geographic concentrations. Our balance sheet is strong, our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity and we have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support the acquisitions focus.","Turning to the outlook for the remainder of the 2012, we anticipate 2012 revenue to be up low double digits on a percentage basis from 2011. Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis for of AMETEK.","Earnings for 2012 are now expected to be in the range of the $1.85 to $1.87 per diluted share, up 17% to 18% over 2011. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $1.83 to $1.85 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2012 sales are expected to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.46 to $0.48 per diluted share, up 10% to 14% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","So in summary our overall business performed well in the third quarter, despite a continued sluggish global environment. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will respond with additional cost containment actions if needed to ensure our cost structure is aligned with the slowing global economic environment.","We have a strong balance sheet that generates significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizable investments in new product development, as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth. Our strong backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2012.","Bob Mandos will now cover some of the financial details and then we will be glad to take your questions.","Bob Mandos","Thank you Frank. As Frank noted, we had a strong third quarter with excellent financial performance and a very high quality of earnings. I will provide some further details. Growth in selling expenses was in line with growth in sales. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales, below last year\u2019s third quarter level of 1.5% of sales. ","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.4%, up from last year\u2019s third quarter rate of 29.5%. We anticipate a tax rate of between 30% and 31% for the full year of 2012. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 18.2% of sales in the third quarter, up slightly from last year\u2019s third quarter level.","Capital spending was $13 million for the quarter. Full year 2012 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $60 million. Depreciation and amortization was $27 million for the quarter. For all of 2012 we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $107 million.","Our cash flow was excellent in the third quarter. Operating cash flow was $163 million, up 19% over the cash flow from last year\u2019s third quarter and at a record level. Free cash flow was $150 million in the quarter, representing 130% of net income. Operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $419 million, up 18% from the same period in 2011, and free cash flow was $386 million for the nine months ended September 2012, representing 140% of net income. For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income. ","Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy, where we extended approximately $500 million through September 30. Total debt was $1.37 billion at September 30, up $180 million from the end of 2011. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $163 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 33%, down from 35% at the end of 2011.","At September 30, we had approximately $800 million of cash in existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Micro-Poise Measurement Systems. Capital deployed was $170 million, which brings our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2012 to approximately $670 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.","In summary we had a very solid third quarter, establishing records for all key operating metrics. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flow.","Kevin Coleman","Great, thanks Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). One moment please for the first question. And our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo","Frank, I think you mentioned, and maybe I'm hearing incorrectly that you said Asia and Europe were strong for you and I guess it's contrary to what we've been sort of hearing. Could you discuss that a little bit.","Frank Hermance","Yes, actually if we look geographically for us, in terms for full sales for Asia we were up about 13%, for Europe about 25% and the U.S. was up 6%. If you look organically it was 5% in Europe, 5% in Asia and actually negative 1% in the U.S. So there definitely was strength in our international businesses, at least as compared to the U.S business and that was driven by a number of factors. In particular our Aerospace and Power businesses were strong outside the United States. We are gaining share in parts of our MRO business outside the United States, in particular in Europe. So that had a positive impact on the results and although Asia at 5% is down from what we were growing substantially, a year up to two ago, it still was relatively good with a number of our instrument businesses. In particular our Oil and Gas and our Med division were very strong in the quarter. So overall international was okay for us.","Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo","Great, and that order, I think you said they were up 10%. What was the core of that and also any noticeable trends in the quarter into October?","Frank Hermance","The trends were good. Basically the trend was up with each month in the quarter sequentially better than the previous month; so that was encouraging. Core was down slightly but that was on a very tough comparison.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Berry with UBS. Please proceed.","Robert Berry - UBS","I was wondering if you could update us on how price rise and cost impacting, and in particular, if you are starting to see any movement in your favor on commodities.","Frank Hermance","Yes, in terms of price for the quarter, we were up about 2% which was what we had anticipated and we have a measure of price minus inflation with inflation is everything like material, wages et cetera, and when we sum that up, the pricing minus net inflation was up about a percent and that\u2019s about what it has been. So I would say, I have seen no real change in that trend. Even though the global economy is obviously a bit weaker, we have been able to get the pricing and that\u2019s predominantly because of the niche focus that we have where price is low on the buy or purchase criteria. So we are able to get the pricing.","In terms of your question on commodities, we have structured the company in a way that commodity prices do not have a major impact on the bottom line and that is done through agreements that we have with our customers, where there are escalators in our contracts, on the customer side and as you know we are very, very good on the input side; so that in essence are bottom line is not dramatically changed in either direction via commodity changes. It does have an impact on overall organic growth and actually in the third quarter, we probably lost about a point of internal growth, maybe a little bit less than that due to the reduction in commodity pricing but again the bottom line was secure as you can see from our results.","Robert Berry - UBS","Yes. Absolutely very solid results, congrats on that. Just maybe finally, I was curious to dig in more on some of these later cycle end markets, oil and gas, aero, power but, maybe it makes sense for you just to walk us through EIG as you often do.","Frank Hermance","","Sure. I\u2019ll go through EIG and I will start with aerospace. Our overall aerospace business really performed extremely well in the quarter. We had high single digit organic growth, on broad based strength in essentially all parts of our aerospace business. In particular, our commercial OEM business was particularly strong.","For all 2012, our anticipation is that the commercial business and our business and regional jet business will be up low double digits organically, and our third party MRO and military businesses, each will be up mid-single digits and our military business also was pleasantly surprising in a sense of being very strong in the third quarter.","So, we are predicting, and as we have predicted that overall aerospace for the full year 2012 should be up mid to high single digits and probably those are leaning now to the higher single digits versus mid, just based on the third quarter results.","Our process businesses performed well in the third quarter. Sales were up about 10%. Upstream oil and gas continued to show sizeable strength while, as I mentioned also our Material Analysis Division was also very strong. Obviously, the growth benefited from the O\u2019Brien, TMC, and Reichert acquisitions in the process part of the business. Organic growth was up low single digits in the quarter and again business was solid internationally.","For all of 2012, we expect this business to grow mid-teens on a percentage basis with low to mid-single digit organic growth and in particular we expect continued strong performance from our later cycle upstream oil and gas businesses, just doing extremely well.","And the last part the EIG is power and industrial and overall for the third quarter sales were up mid-teens on a percentage basis, driven by strong growth in our power business, also the contribution from the EM Test acquisition and our heavy vehicle business also showed particular strength in the quarter. Sales grew mid-single digits organically for all of power and industrial and for 2012 we expect sales for power and industrial to be up high-single digits overall and low-single digits organically.","So if you sum these various parts of EIG, we are expecting 2012 sales to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis with organic growth of low to mid-single digits. And why you didn\u2019t ask about EMG, I\u2019m sure some others will ask, so I\u2019ll just continue on and tell you what happened in EMG.","In the differentiated part of EMG, overall sales were mid-teens on a percentage basis in the quarter while organic sales were up low single digits. We had great growth from our precision motion control and also our military businesses and obviously we also had the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition and for 2012, overall we\u2019re expecting this business to be up approximately mid-teens with organic growth of low single digits. And the last part of the company is our cost driven motors business. Here sales were down organically mid-single digits in the third quarter, due to continued weakness in our international business. So this was an area of weakness outside the United States.","For 2012, we expect sales to be down mid-single digits over 2011. So if you sum these two parts of EMG, we expect all of EMG in 2012 for sales to be up approximately 10%, and organic growth of low single digits and then as I mentioned in my opening remarks, if you know sum what I just said in EIG and EMG, for AMETEK as a whole we\u2019re expecting this low double digit sales growth on a percentage basis with organic growth of low to mid-single digits for the year. I hope that helped you Robert?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies Capital please proceed.","Scott Graham - Jefferies Capital","So, if I\u2019m trying to tease out the fourth quarter sales guidance little bit, it looks like you\u2019re saying organic are about up 2 to 3? Does that sound about right.","Frank Hermance","Maybe that\u2019s a bit high but we basically, with what\u2019s going on in the global economy, when we put our estimates together, we assumed essentially similar performance to the third quarter, which is up in that low single digit arena; and as you know, we\u2019re very good on the cost side of the business. So we added another $5 million in cost savings. So we have extreme confidence I would say in our earnings for the remainder of the year and with this slowing economic environment we are putting a real focus on both cost and acquisitions, because the organic growth for most companies as you\u2019re well aware is in the low single digit kind of arena and that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to drive overall profitability as we go forward here in the short term. So this focus on cost and focus on acquisitions are the two strategies that we\u2019re emphasizing.","Scott Graham - Jefferies Capital","Understood, could you give us an idea of what the EBITDA margin was for Micro-Poise or alternatively the vicinity of the multiple that you paid for that business?","Frank Hermance","Yes, we paid about 7.5 times for the deals and the EBITDA margins are below those of AMETEK and as you are aware, the EBITDA margin of our company is quite high. Actually in the quarter it was about 25%. So most deals that we do now are going to have lower EBITDA margins but that basically speaks to our strength. We see substantial cost and improvement opportunities and synergies with Micro-Poise. We\u2019ve got a management team there that\u2019s excited to be part of our company and when you look this deal from a return-on-invested-capital viewpoint, it\u2019s going to be a home run for us.","Scott Graham - Jefferies Capital","Understood. Last question is on the pipeline. You were pretty confident when I saw you last about being able to do something potentially sizable in the fourth quarter. Was this it or is it possible we could get more, still to come in the fourth quarter.","Frank Hermance","Definitely it\u2019s possible for more. The backlog is very good in terms of deals. We are working on other deals as we speak. When we did talk, I was specifically referencing Micro-Poise, which I knew was going to close, but we have some other deals. We\u2019re looking at one now which is of equal size to Micro-Poise. We have some other smaller deals, more technology oriented deals. So if you look at the next six months, I would be very surprised if you did not hear from us again. We\u2019ve got tremendous cash flow in the company and we feel the best way to utilize that cash flow is to acquire and improve companies.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","So, a couple of questions for you. Maybe we could talk a little bit about Micro-Poise. I know you mentioned that it has a strong base of international sales, about 75%. Can you just flush that out between Europe and Asia?","Frank Hermance","Yes. If you look at Asia, it\u2019s about 44% of sales and Europe is about 25% and the U.S. was about 25% and there is a little in other parts of the world. So this business is heavily focused on the automotive increases in Asia. That\u2019s where we see the growth trend of this business. We did a lot of work on looking at the organics side of this business. The organic growth worldwide is going to be a number in the 7%, 8% kind of region and another very positive attribute to this business is that, it\u2019s got sort of a counter-cyclical effect in that there was very strong portion of the business that\u2019s in the aftermarket. It\u2019s about 35% of the business, so that as the automotive cycle goes down and obviously we\u2019re in an up-cycle right now, but as it goes down there is a balance in this business because people still have to put tires on their cars in essence and that counter-effect of people buying tires for existing automobiles is a counter to the cycle. So we\u2019re pretty excited about this business. It\u2019s a niche business. As you know, everything we do is very niche oriented. It\u2019s got this 50% share, it\u2019s got the international focus. So we think this business is going to be a home run for us.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","And then on the U.S., you guys mentioned that you had a 1% decline. Can you just talk about, have your customers, are they concerned about the fiscal cliff (ph), the election? Is that driving a positive investment that you think picks up again in 2013.","Frank Hermance","Well, that\u2019s a very, very tough question and I think that\u2019s the key question as we look at next year. We are just starting to roll up our budgets and I\u2019m going to be interested to hear what are our businesses say. I can only speculate Nicole. I really don\u2019t know but the weakness was general. It was not in any specific business or specific area. It was in EIG, it was in EMG. I\u2019ve got to believe this fiscal cliff (ph) is part of the issue and just general nervousness with the election et cetera is a factor. Some of our customers are talking about push-outs. They are not saying they are losing share. We have not felt that we are losing share in our businesses. So it\u2019s a very difficult question to answer, but obviously we are being cautious as we go forward and our guidance for the fourth quarter and the fact that we took some additional cost actions is a reflection of that cautiousness.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Okay, I\u2019ll just squeeze in one more before I pass it along. Talking about pricing trends during the quarter, did you see any areas of weakness, and actually the EIG margins were extremely strong. Is there anything special going on there or do you see those as sustainable in the future.","Frank Hermance","Well, I think the EIG margins are sustainable. Our team has done just an incredible job of first selecting businesses that we acquire and also putting new product development and global expansion in these niche markets that have high margin capability and it really comes down to the differentiation of the product. So, it\u2019s just a very, very positive trend.","I think as we go forward, the margins in EMG are going to be the ones that have the higher potential and there is several factors to that. One is continued trust in terms of cost reductions, buying businesses like Dunkermotoren that have good inherent margin capability and also just as this business shifts from the cost driven side to the more differentiated businesses, as a result of our strategy, those margins will expand. So, I do think that the margin capability is going to be higher in EMG than EIG as we go forward. And there was another part to your question?","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley","Oh I was just curious on pricing, if you saws any areas of concern?","Frank Hermance","","The only, I mean I don\u2019t think there is anything that is different. The pricing weakness in the company follows the level of differentiation. So, it\u2019s harder in our cost driven businesses to get pricing and as you go further up the differentiation curve, we are able to get much higher pricing and that basically sums to this 2% that I was talking about. But I don\u2019t think that should change. That\u2019s pretty similar to what is has been historically. So, I don\u2019t see a trend change. I think it\u2019s just the normal dynamics of our business.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Just a follow up to the last line of questioning; Frank, what were your core incremental margins, excluding acquisitions in EIG and EMG during the quarter?","Frank Hermance","They were just off charts, no other way to say it Matt and to a certain degree when you have this low organic growth number, the incremental margins are less important but I can tell you that the contribution margins were well, well above 40%.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, and then similar to a prior question; some of what you sell, particularly in the high-end process business, definitely runs through customers capital budgets. Some of these instruments can sell for tens, hundreds and even, $2 million apiece. Are the discussions you are having with customers indicative of you C level executives going back and re-examining that capital budget? Do they need to buy it this year? Can they push it out? And have you in fact seen any sort of slippage yet, in some of those higher end process businesses?","Frank Hermance","Interesting question, Matt. I would say that we definitely had the impact that you\u2019re talking about in some of our lower priced instruments, or maybe I should say medium priced instruments, where there definitely is this sort of concern and indecision and we definitely heard people saying we\u2019re going wait a quarter, this is going to be pushed out and I\u2019m sure internally in those companies that\u2019s being impacted by upper management having a concern over their capital budgets.","Interestingly though, at the very high end of our business, it\u2019s absolutely the opposite, where I think you\u2019re familiar with our CAMECA business and that business tends to go counter-cyclical to the semiconductor cycle and when things are weaker in semiconductor, basically the semiconductor companies put more investment in RD&E. So that business is just doing incredibly well for us. So it\u2019s an interesting dynamic, the thesis of your question. Just stepping back you would think would be accurate but in fact it\u2019s not for the reasons that I indicated.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets","That\u2019s interesting. Thanks for the perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets please proceed.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","First question, just a follow on the U.S. commentary. Was it pretty consistent throughout the quarter? We\u2019ve heard from some companies talking about how the quarter kind of weakened as it went on or September didn\u2019t ramp as expected. Just kind of wondering how you felt throughout 3Q?","Frank Hermance","I didn\u2019t feel that. As I mentioned we had a very strong end of the quarter and it was pretty consistent within the framework of the higher growth internationally and subdued growth in the U.S., but I didn\u2019t feel a trend change and I have heard other companies make the comment that you\u2019re marking but I can say we\u2019re an abnormality there.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, and then, just on the cost savings front, you ratcheted that up a bit. Was that due to out-performance of those initiatives versus your expectations or more of a step up due to the sluggish demand environment you\u2019re sort of seeing right now?","Frank Hermance","Yes, it was the latter. We\u2019re just feeling that things are a bit sluggish and we decided early in the third quarter, after our last earning\u2019s release that we were going to take additional actions. We did that and in essence, we added that extra $5 million cost savings, which obviously is going to largely come in to the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter and that\u2019s why we have this very high confidence level in our earnings. We\u2019re not going to rely on organic growth to be the driver. We\u2019re going to rely on cost reductions and our acquired businesses, as I said before.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, and the motor segment or the other, I guess you know how much of them, do you feel you have to continue those initiatives, if the environment stays consistent where it is?","Frank Hermance","Yes, we feel there is a significant additional leverage. It\u2019s an advantage of a niche-oriented acquisition strategy that we have. As we buy these businesses, there are significant improvements and consolidations that are possible. You can see we\u2019re relatively balanced between EIG and EMG in terms of those acquisitions. So we see substantial opportunity there and there is another thrust that we have not talked about a lot externally, but we\u2019re putting a lot of energy now into value engineering.","We have trained our entire engineering teams on value engineering and we\u2019re basically doing things with our existing products, where we can lower the cost and raise their margins and Bob, maybe you can help. I think what I saw was this year about $11 million. Is that the right number?","Bob Mandos","That\u2019s correct.","Frank Hermance","Yes, it was about an $11 million this year that we\u2019re getting to the bottom line as result of value engineering. So it\u2019s just another thrust and it\u2019s in both parts of the business. So we\u2019re just aggressive. We\u2019re relentless in terms of getting cost out of the businesses and it\u2019s the key driver as to why AMETEK performs extremely well in these weak environments and we tend to outperform our peers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baliotti with Janney Montgomery Scott, please proceed.","John Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott","Bob, maybe in honor of my predecessor Jim Lucas, could you give us that payables number?","Bob Mandos","Sure, $288 million.","John Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott","Great. Frank, it\u2019s encouraging to see the benefits you are taking, the cost actions are coming through so quickly and I know all the companies that we follow are pretty different, more different than they are alike, but do you have any sort of expectation as far as the lasting benefits, or sort of the follow on benefits you will get in addition to shoring up some of the lack of visibility this year, but they may feel the build on in 2013 or years beyond.","Frank Hermance","I would say, the majority of the savings we\u2019re talking about will continue on. A good part of this $80 million is material cost savings on the input side. It\u2019s about $48 million. So that will continue. You will see a year-over-year positive impact, because obviously we put these cost reductions in incrementally throughout 2012 so that you will see a year-on-year benefit, just due to that timing impact, and then we will have another program for next year, which Bob actually drives that will give us additional material savings, give us additional value engineering. We will have additional movement of products to low cost manufacturing, which for us will be China, Mexico and Eastern Europe.","So we continually will put cost reductions through the P&L. It\u2019s sort of a hallmark of our company. A little bit of the $80 million in fairness was what I would call belt tightening and our businesses and I\u2019ve seen it in some of their spreadsheets, when they send them in to come to this $80 million, their hope is business will be better so that they could spend some of that belt tightening reductions they\u2019re putting in place this year; and I think what that will really depend on is what we see next year. If things feel a little better, as we get into the first quarter then we will basically probably spend that and it will not be incremental sort of year-to-year but if its weak, we will just keep our belts tighter. But I would say the majority is definitely stuff that will continue.","John Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott","The majority of structural improvement in the operations.","Frank Hermance","That\u2019s exactly right.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Yes, good morning. Frank, just on that last comment, the $48 million of the $80 million is cost savings due to your sourcing initiatives. How was that kind of a variable cost savings? How was it possible to bump up your sourcing cost savings in a weaker market? Is this just basically going back to vendors and asking for concessions on pricing?","Bob Mandos","I would say; this is Bob Mandos. It\u2019s a combination of utilizing our global procurement organization and continuing to drive into low cost regions, our sourcing strategy and we have really a top level strategy there to continually drive year-in and year-out that incremental savings in low cost regions. So we clearly continue to expand in China, but we\u2019re looking at other parts of the world, whether it\u2019d be other parts of Asia, Eastern Europe et cetera. Additionally we focus on the value-add, value engineering aspect of it throughout the whole company and particularly on the differentiated size of businesses and continually to drive our organization is a key metric for cost improvement.","Frank Hermance","","Then I\u2019ll add, the other piece is just the MRO material that we procure, lights and just the various things to keep our operations. There is tremendous leverage in terms of accumulating our total spend across the whole company of those MRO type items and just continuing to drive cost. We\u2019ve had substantial improvements in things like FedEx cost by amalgamating our part volumes and for some of our plants, we buy chemicals and again if you can amalgamate that volume, you have leverage with your customers. So this is just relentless, continuous and Bob and his organization who drive this have done a really, really great job.","Bob Mandos","And the other point I\u2019d just make on acquisitions. We continue to drive our strategy, our sourcing strategy to our new acquisitions. You\u2019ve heard us talk about operational excellence and how that\u2019s core competency for us, while we drive that into the newly acquired companies and generate synergy through that mechanism.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","So the larger the acquisitions, as they flow in, driving your value engineering, but probably more important the sourcing piece can get you an inflating number of cost savings?","Frank Hermance","Exactly.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Yes, can I also ask on the EIG business in the quarter, did the acquisitions contribute as expected from a revenue perspective? I would have heard the\u2026","Frank Hermance","(inaudible).","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Okay, that\u2019s not a little bit light or anything?","Frank Hermance","No, maybe a hair but not significantly. It was pretty close to what we said. We gave guidance and we were very close to our guidance. We said low double digits and we were at 12%.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Yes, just the mix of between the acquisition. It looked like - okay. And then just one quick question on the margin line. If I look at the EMG margins, did Dunker contribute approximately their penny for the quarter?","Frank Hermance","Yes they did, but they did what we they were going to do but the impact on margins was actually dilutive and it was dilutive about 100 basis points. So that 20 basis point improvement that you saw was really, if you exclude Dunker, it was 120 basis points. So we were able to outperform based on our cost activities et cetera.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Yes, because again, using our estimates if I look at EMG and I pull out the Dunker contribution, and again you made maybe $5 million of core profit on a sales decline. Is that primarily the cost reductions coming through?","Frank Hermance","Absolutely Rick, and that\u2019s why my comment before that almost can\u2019t look at contribution margins because it really comes down to getting the cost out of these businesses and I think we have done a superb job of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","Frank, going back to the margin question, looking at it a different way, gross margins seems to have had just an internal step up the past year then even from the year before. Can you relate how much is due your core operating improvements versus, are you buying business that at the heart of them, once you really get them integrated have higher gross margins and a lot of your legacy business and should they continue to improve over the time as you make more acquisitions?","Frank Hermance","Yes, you hit it right on the head, absolutely. As we look to buy businesses, we look for businesses that inherently have this high level of differentiation that I have talked about for many years and if you look at the dynamics of those businesses, by definition they have higher gross margins. So as we have moved the company from a sort of our cost-driven legacy businesses, which have low gross margins, the overall gross margin of the company has improved. So what you\u2019re seeing is definitely a function of the inherent capability of the businesses but then of course we make improvements in these businesses and you\u2019re seeing that flow through this as well. So you really focused on a point that\u2019s at the heart of our strategy.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","Is it possible to get another point on gross margin improvement in 2013?","Frank Hermance","Yes. Well, 2013, I\u2019m not going to give any guidance for 2013. We will do that in January, but if you asked me is there any possibility to get another point, definitely.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","(inaudible) volumes right?","Frank Hermance","Yes, right, exactly. Well, I think that\u2019s definitely possible, but I don\u2019t want to put a timeframe on it until we roll up our budgets and I\u2019ll some guidance on that in January or February whenever we release earnings.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","Okay. And then finally how big is China these days for you and how did China perform since (ph) December?","Frank Hermance","China did well for us. If you look at our total Asia sales, they were about 19% of our company and China in rough numbers is half of that. And they performed, not as strong as it had a year and half ago when we were seeing organic growth rates out of China that were 20% plus but we are now more in that single digit category. But again if you look at it from a worldwide basis it\u2019s surely stronger than the U.S. and we are going to continue to invest in that part of the world.","Just another statistic, if you look at our BRIC countries and sort of take that slice, they were up about, I remember right about 12% in the quarter and very importantly, the margins in our BRIC countries is about equivalent to our overall company margin. So, we are not going into these areas by essentially competing on lower price and getting lower margins. We\u2019re able to get our margins in those parts of the world and enjoy the growth. So even though China, I guess they just came out with this 7.4% GDP growth in the second quarter, it\u2019s not what it was, but it\u2019s still pretty good and we\u2019re going to continue to invest there.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Matt McConnell - Citigroup","I\u2019d like to just come back to Aero real quick, which has been really strong especially, relative to what some of your peers have been reporting, and especially on the military side. So is there anything that you can point to in either new products or platforms or share gains and maybe talk about sustainability of that growth into 2013 for Aero?","Frank Hermance","Yes, the second part of your question is a difficult one but let me take the first part and we have decided and have made investments in areas where the basic growth of the DOD budget is larger in those niche areas than the base budget itself and those areas are basically helicopters. We started literally 10 or 12 years ago to invest in helicopters and that\u2019s a very strong area. Again, that niche is outpacing the base DOD budget, that\u2019s predominately on the EIG side.","On the EMG side, we\u2019ve made substantial investments in cooling where we are basically the company to do cooling of electronics on military aircraft or military ground-based vehicles or even military operations where we go into certain bases and we\u2019ll basically upgrade the electronics that they use for radar and things of that nature. And as a result again, that area is outgrowing the base DOD budget. So we\u2019re enjoying some of that growth.","The second part of your question is much more difficult and that comes to the question of sequestration and what is going to happen. Your prediction is probably better than mine but I\u2019ll tell you what my best guess is on sequestration, which actually the President last night had some comments that would support what I\u2019m going to say. The way sequestration is put in to effect makes absolutely no sense, because basically you have to go down every line item of the budget and reduce that line item. It essentially gives no degree of flexibility to the people who are making those decisions. So if we are going to in and make substantial changes, whether it\u2019s on the military side or the nonmilitary side, you want to give the people that are in power the ability to make the decisions, versus this sort of line item approach.","So if you step back and say that\u2019s just unrealistic, I think the more logical thing is it\u2019s going to be very difficult. I think they get in agreement between the election and January. So my best call would be that what will happen is Congress will pass something that will delay this six months or nine months and they will try to battle out an agreement that make sense and give our people basically some discretion and I think wherever it ends up, we will outperform it.","So if you look at these numbers, even take the worst case on sequestration, you\u2019re talking about 6% - 7% kind of decline a year. Obviously this isn\u2019t going to be a high growth part of our business, but we also don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be some major problem. If you look at our total military spending it\u2019s on the order of 10% or 11% of AMETEK and a good part of that is outside the U.S. and it wouldn\u2019t be even impacted by sequestration. So that\u2019s a long answer to your question but it\u2019s obviously a difficult question with what\u2019s going on.","Operator","Our next question is a follow up question from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies Capital. Please proceed.","Scott Graham - Jefferies Capital","My question has been answered. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird, please proceed.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Yes, Frank, can I just ask you, on Aerospace; the commercial and regional pieces of your Aerospace business typically, I believe are in EIG and the question I had, can you just repeat how those did in the quarter? I know you said they were particularly strong but is that plus mid-single digits or mid-double digits, excuse me.","Frank Hermance","Yes, it was more in the 10% kind of area for those two parts and so they were very, very strong.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","I know when we travelled a while back and I think your comment, you did a nice job of kind of laying out some meaningful content gains on both; primarily on the regional side but I think on the commercial side and would you attribute a portion, say half of that growth to content gains on various aircraft or how would you characterize the content benefit?","Frank Hermance","Yes, it\u2019s a great question and in reality on the commercial side, it is right now more driven my market dynamics, where if you look at the number of planes that are being produced by Boeing and Airbus, this year they are going to be up about 17%. Each are producing around 600 aircraft in the year and that trend is going to continue and actually increase.","As you mentioned, on the business and regional jet, the market dynamics there are not the greatest right now. Actually they are kind of bouncing a long bottom but there we have definitely won some major content on, in particular Gulfstream aircraft which is driving our growth. So that in the short term is content wins.","Now let me come back to the commercial side because the way we view it is the long term future of our commercial business is dependent on the new aircraft and so we have made substantial investments in those new aircraft and I\u2019ll just give you a few numbers Rick to put some flavor on it. If we look at 350, actually I just read this morning that they opened a new plant in Toulouse, France for the 350. That is going to be our largest content airplane. It\u2019s going to have a ship set value of about $150,000 and over a 10 year period we are going to get about $380 million of revenue from that. So that\u2019s going to be a very strong aircraft for us.","The 380, obviously not as many aircraft, but that\u2019s going to have about $66 million of content over that same period. The 787 is going to be about $220 million. The content value there will be lower per aircraft, about 85 and just to jump for a moment, another very large content aircraft for us, which speaks of the future of the military business is the Joint Strike Fighter, where we have about 140,000 of content and that will be about $600 million, but that\u2019s over the life of that program, not 10 years. So the point I\u2019m trying to make and just put the military aside for a minute is that for commercial the short term is more market driven, but the long term is content driven and for business and regional jet the short term is more content driven, but in the longer term will be more market driven.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Got it, okay. That one was a tongue twister.","Operator","","And there appear to be no further questions. At this time I\u2019ll turn the call back to you.

We'll begin today with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then open it up for questions.","I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK's results in the second quarter were superb. We reported record sales with very strong organic growth and excellent contributions from recent acquisitions. We ended the quarter with a record level of backlog following another quarter of strong orders growth. We delivered excellent operating performance, resulting in record level EBITDA, record operating income, significant margin expansion, and sizable growth in diluted earnings per share. We also completed another acquisition in the quarter, continuing to deploy a robust free cash flow on strategic acquisitions.","Given these outstanding results, we have again raised our guidance for 2018. So overall, just a fantastic quarter with very high quality results.","Now on to the financial highlights. Total sales in the second quarter were a record $1.21 billion, up 14% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Organic sales were up 7%, acquisitions added 5%, and foreign currency was a two-point tailwind.","We are very pleased with the organic growth as it remains broad based across our businesses and geographies. Orders growth was also very solid in the quarter. Overall orders were up 8% with organic orders up 5% even with a difficult comparison from the second quarter of 2017. As a result, we finished the second quarter with a record backlog of $1.6 billion. EBITDA in the second quarter was a record $317.6 million, up 17% over the second quarter of 2017 with EBITDA margins are very strong 26.3%.","Operating income in the second quarter was a record $270.1 million, up 18% over the prior year. Reported operating income margins were up 70 basis points to 22.3%. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, operating margins were up an impressive 110 basis points over the second quarter last year. This level of margin expansion speaks to the excellent operating leverage our businesses generate. Second quarter earnings were $0.83 per diluted share, up an outstanding 28% compared to the same period last year, and above our guidance of $0.76 to $0.78 per share.","Now, turning to the individual operating groups, first, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG had an excellent second quarter with strong sales growth and tremendous operating performance. Sales for EIG in the second quarter were a record $744.5 million, up 13% over the same quarter of 2017. Organic sales were up 6% and recent acquisitions also contributed 6%. Foreign currency was a 1% benefit to EIG sales in the quarter. While growth was broad based across our EIG businesses, we saw a particularly strong organic growth across our Ultra Precision Technologies division.","Second quarter operating income for EIG was $193.8 million, up 18% over the prior year. Reported operating income margins were excellent at 26%, up 110 basis points over the second quarter of 2017. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG margins were up an exceptional 180 basis points over the prior year.","The Electromechanical Group also had a fantastic quarter with record sales and operating results. EMG sales in the quarter were a record $464.5 million, up 14% over the same period last year. Organic sales growth was excellent at 9% with solid demand across our engineered materials and thermal management systems businesses. The acquisition of FMH Aerospace contributed an additional 3% and foreign currency provided a 2% benefit in the quarter.","Operating income in the second quarter was a record $94.3 million, an 11% increase compared to the second quarter of 2017. Operating margins were strong at 20.3% for the quarter.","In summary, AMETEK delivered another outstanding quarter. Our teams are performing at a very high level and remain focused on delivering high quality results. We remain committed to investing in our businesses and our people to generate sustained long-term success for our shareholders. We also remain committed to deploying our strong free cash flow on strategic acquisitions where we can leverage the AMETEK business model to drive meaningful improvements. And we have had a strong first half of the year on the acquisition front, completing three deals and deploying approximately $370 million in capital.","As a quick recap, in January, we expanded the capabilities of our aerospace and defense businesses through the acquisition of FMH Aerospace, a leading provider of highly engineered and differentiated components for use in the aerospace, defense and space markets.","In April, we announced the acquisition of SoundCom, which designs, integrates, and services clinical workflow and communication systems for end users in the health care, government, and educational markets. SoundCom was a wonderful addition to our growing health care solutions platform as a value-added reseller for Rauland-Borg, the leading local provider of mission critical clinical communications and workflow solutions to hospitals, health care systems, and educational facilities.","Rauland has experienced a very strong growth since being acquired in the first quarter of 2017, with organic sales up low double digits in the second quarter. Rauland is seeing robust demand for its market leading communication solutions and has done a fantastic job leveraging AMETEK's business system to improve its profitability.","In addition to FMH and SoundCom, we recently completed the acquisition of Motec, a leading provider of vision systems for the high growth mobile machine vision market. Headquartered in Germany, Motec provides integrated vision systems that combine ruggedized mobile cameras with advanced software to improve operational efficiency and enhance safety. These applications are used in a variety of end markets, including automation, agriculture, transportation, defense, and logistics.","Motec's differentiated solutions nicely complement our Instrumentation and Specialty Controls business, and provide AMETEK with a leadership position in this very high growth adjacent market segment. Motec has annual sales of approximately $35 million and we deployed approximately $95 million on the acquisition.","Our acquisition teams are managing a very active acquisition pipeline and we remain focused on deploying our strong free cash flow on strategic acquisitions. Given our balance sheet strength, plus the additional flexibility resulting from tax reform, we are in a strong position to pursue additional acquisition opportunities and are very excited about the opportunities in our pipeline.","We are also very excited about the success of our organic growth initiatives as our businesses are seeing very positive results from these efforts. While our end markets remain strong, our excellent organic sales growth indicates our efforts to enhance our sales and marketing processes and a continued focus on new product development are having a positive impact.","One example of the success of our efforts can be seen across our Ultra Precision Technologies division. This division includes a tremendous set of highly differentiated businesses, with leading edge technologies and solutions, providing ultra precise metrology solutions and precision optical products for an attractive set of markets and applications.","As noted earlier, these businesses have delivered tremendous results recently with robust growth in both sales and orders. This growth reflects the strength of their technology in niche leadership positions across the markets they serve. These businesses are capturing incremental market share as a result of their global and market expansion initiatives, and success with their new product development efforts.","As an example, Creaform, a pioneer in 3D scanning measurement technology, recently unveiled their latest coordinate measuring machine, known as the CUBE-R. The CUBE-R is a complete turnkey solution that provides fast, precise, and automated 3D measurement capability for a shop floor environment. Utilizing Creaform's MetraSCAN 3D metrology scanner, along with the efficiency and reliability of robotic automated industrial measuring cell, the CUBE-R can measure and inspect parts and components up to three meters in length with metrology grade accuracy.","This solution is allowing our customers to enhance their quality control in a reliable, safe, and efficient manner. New products and solutions like the CUBE-R continue to be a key driver for sustained organic growth and AMETEK's long-term success.","Our vitality index, which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions introduced within the last three years, is one way to measure the success of our research, development, and engineering efforts. Through the first half of the year, our vitality index was excellent at 23%, reflecting the tremendous work of our teams to design and implement these new products and solutions. In 2018, we expect to increase our RD&E investment by 6% year-over-year to approximately $235 million.","Before providing our updated outlook for 2018, I wanted to provide a few comments on the global trade situation. While tariffs have had a minimal effect on our business thus far, we do expect that incremental headwinds will need to be managed as tariffs are implemented and supply chains adjust.","We are confident in our ability to largely mitigate these headwinds, given our ability to capture incremental pricing due to the highly differentiated nature of our businesses, plus the strength and flexibility of our global supply chain. The situation remains fluid and uncertain, but what we know now at this point, we expect the net impact of tariffs to be only a modest headwind for the balance of 2018, and this headwind is reflected in our guidance.","Now, on to the outlook. Given our outstanding performance in the first half of the year and our positive outlook for the back half of 2018, we now expect earnings to be in the range of $3.16 to $3.20 per diluted share, up 21% to 23% from 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.61. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $3.06 to $3.12.","We continue to expect AMETEK overall sales to be up low double digits with organic sales up mid-single digits for all of 2018, with EIG organic sales also up mid-single digits, and EMG organic sales up high single digits. For the third quarter, overall sales are projected to be up high single digits with organic sales up mid-single digits compared to the same quarter of 2017. Third quarter diluted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $0.76 to $0.78, up 15% to 18% over the prior year period.","To summarize, AMETEK's performance through the first six months of the year was outstanding. We are firmly positioned to deliver record results in 2018 and continued success in the long-term, backed by our world class teams and focus on executing our four growth strategies.","I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an excellent second quarter with record results and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial details.","In the second quarter, core selling expenses were up in line with core sales growth. Our second quarter general and administrative expenses were down modestly compared to 2017 and as a percentage of sales were 1.5%, down from last year's level of 1.8% of sales.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 21.9% versus last year's rate of 26%. The year-over-year reduction in our effective tax rate was due to the benefits of tax reform. We expect our 2018 tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 23%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.","Working capital was very solid at 17.2% of sale from the second quarter, down from 17.9% of sales a year ago. Capital expenditures were $16 million for the quarter, and for the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $85 million or 1.8% of sales.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $49 million. And for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $200 million.","Second quarter operating cash flow was $203 million and free cash flow was $187 million. For the first six months of 2018, free cash flow was up 12% over the prior year period. And for the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 110% of net income.","As Dave mentioned, we've been very active on the acquisition front, deploying approximately $370 million on the acquisitions of FMH Aerospace, SoundCom, and Motec thus far in 2018. Total debt at June 30 was $2.15 billion, down slightly from the end of 2017.","Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $558 million, resulting in a net debt to EBITDA ratio as of June 30 of approximately 1.3 times. Following the three acquisitions we completed this year, we have more than $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.","In summary, the performance from our businesses during the second quarter was outstanding. We delivered record level results with a high quality of earnings, and we remain well-positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Bill. Glenda, could we please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, Scott, you're coming in clear.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Very good. Well done on the quarter.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I have two questions for you. I know you position the organic orders of up 5% as facing a tough comp, and certainly we know that orders tend to be lumpy. You've had double-digit in the past and all this. Is there anything at all, Dave, that we should be reading into the plus 5%, the slower?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","No. I think Q2 orders were strong, Scott. We had a positive book-to-bill in the quarter of 1.02, up mid-single digits, some tough comps. You remember that in Q2 2017, we had 12% organic growth. And the mid-single-digit growth was broad based. Both our EIG and our EMG businesses were both balanced and up in orders.","And if you recall in our EMG business in Q1, there was a little bit of a seasonality factor. But the nature of that business being OEM customers, will replace the order for the balance of the year. So, that was really \u2013 that strongly happened in Q1. And we also saw some military orders in Q1 related to our TMS business. And as you know, those can be very lumpy. So, there's nothing at all to worry about. There's a very strong orders growth, broad based, positive book-to-bill, and is balanced across the business.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thank you. My follow-up is essentially on the tariffs. So, we have a strategy of moving production to low-cost facilities, low-cost areas. So, I guess I was a little bit surprised to hear you say nominal impact and all of that, when you do a fair amount of manufacturing in China for markets that are not in China. Could you kind of maybe go through how you get to only a small or nominal impact in the second half?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. It's a great question, and our executive office has been actively involved in managing the situation with our business teams. So, we start from a great position because of our business model and the capabilities we have. As you know, we have niche differentiated businesses with low CapEx requirements by design. So, our model provides pricing power, combined with a flexible operating structure. And capability-wise, we have one of the best supply chain organizations in the business.","So, we're really well-positioned from capability, and we've currently been working on several work streams. There's resourcing activities ongoing, obviously, supplier negotiations. There's a few relocation of production locations. If you export from the U.S., which you know we do, and you import components that have a tariff, you can go through the duty drawback process and recollect just about the entire tariff.","We've also built a bit of inventory ahead of the tariffs to avoid paying the tariffs that were implemented in July. And based on everything we know, we have less than $0.01 impact in both Q3 and Q4, and that includes not only the tariffs on steel and aluminum, but the Section 301, and that even includes the proposed $200 billion that was proposed at 10% on a bunch of different items. Now, that can change, but we've also factored that into.","So, with our capability and our capability of price, and our capability in our supply chain, I feel very comfortable we're ideally situated to manage the tariff situation and it's a process, and we now have a great process in place.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And the productivity savings, I think last quarter, you said about $85 million. Is that intact?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","No. We're still going to get $85 million. We're having a strong year and we'll still get $85 million. Our supply chain teams have this additional load, but we're still going to get the $85 million.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Hey. Question on Motec. I'm just reading the description of it, wondering if that is somewhat of a direct play on the electrical vehicle market. And also given the high growth profile of it, just wondering if you measure the trend line in terms of expanding pipeline of opportunities, given probably some longer spec cycles there?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, Motec's a great business, Chris. And it's not so much on electric vehicles, but it is on the embedded mobile machine market. It's a leading provider of vision systems. So, their products improve operational efficiency and enhance safety. They have integrated vision systems combined with ruggedized cameras for harsh environments, electronic hardware and software for high speed video processing, and unique proprietary algorithms for applications that automate and make mobile machines safer.","So, when you put those three factors together, the ruggedized cameras, the video processing, and the software and the algorithms, they're really in a unique position in a burgeoning market that has good long-term growth drivers. And the business has been growing at 20%-plus a year for the last three years. Their end markets are balanced across transportation, ag, logistics, construction, military vehicles. They're very unique applications, where they're helping their customers improve the quality and safety of their operations, very strong capability in engineering.","The company's headquartered in Germany. The majority of their sales are in Europe. And it fits very well with our ISC business. So, the sales channel opportunities for both businesses are really good. So, we're really optimistic. We bought it from two private founders. The competitors are relatively small. They're well-positioned, and we're really optimistic what we're going to be able to do with the business.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Sounds cool. And my next one is, have you seen any platforms that are starting to feel toppy or tapering off in terms of business units, markets, or geographies as you look around, just given you have pretty widespread breadth?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, it's a great question, Chris. I mean when you look at our business, both our EIG and EMG business are up mid-single digits or better. If you look at all of our market areas, and Scott didn't ask that question, but if you look at all of our market areas in the process, aerospace, power and industrial, and automated and engineering, all those businesses are up mid-single digits or better. If you go around the world, all the geographies are up mid-single digits or better. So, we're feeling very optimistic and we're not seeing any sign of slowdown.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","That sounds good. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Just like to circle back on the price\/cost and tariffs, and it sounds like that's all being well managed. Just a couple real specifics is because you have such leadership in these niche differentiated markets, we typically associate that with good pricing power. Can you share with us any pricing actions that you've taken? What kind of schedule, feedback, or acceptance from customers? But color on that would be really helpful.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure, Deane. In Q2, we achieved price of 1.9%. So, that was up from 1.4% in Q2. So, we had mentioned that we would get ahead of this and our business teams did a great job of getting price in the quarter. Total inflation was about 1.2%. So, we had a positive spread there.","And we were able to more than offset the increasing inflationary costs with increased pricing. And the results speak to the differentiated nature of our portfolio.","So, in terms of the environment, I think with the tariffs and a little bit of inflation, it's becoming a bit easier to pass on pricing right now. And I think for the full year, we expect inflation to pick up a bit. We can see that in the channel building. So, we had 1.2% inflation in Q2 and Q1. We can see that picking up a bit in the balance of the year. But we think our pricing is going to remain strong and we'll maintain a positive spread for the full year.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got that. That's real helpful. And how serious are you looking at potential relocation of production? We've heard companies like Danaher call that out explicitly that that's part of their potential game plan. Is that stuff that you'll move forward on or is it just in terms of if things escalate?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","We have a very flexible manufacturing setup where we have in low-cost regions. So, there are certain product lines and by no means our entire portfolio, but certain product lines we're looking at relocating because we already have capability to manufacture in the region. So, we have manufacturing capability in a couple of regions, and we'll move it to a place that's not impacted by tariffs. But there are really a couple of select areas where we're looking at that and that will likely happen.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And if I just squeeze one more in please on oil and gas. How was that in the quarter? And then there was some news this week about additional pipeline investments coming, and would you be in a position to participate in that?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, great question, Deane. Our oil and gas business performed well in Q2. It was up mid-single digits. And we saw good strength in our upstream business that was up mid-teens. And our mid and downstream business that would be more tied to your pipelines and the downstream refinery, it was up low single digits. That was for the quarter.","For the full year, we expect sales to be up mid to high single digits, where the upstream stays strong, but the mid and downstream get a little bit better as we progress through the year. And with $70 oil, we're seeing solid business activity. Our capital spending budgets are increasing. We are seeing a global pickup in activity. And there's been a lack of investments over the past few years. So, we're viewing the outlook on the oil and gas business over the next few years as very positive.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good to hear. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Couple of questions. First, if you look at just your incremental margins, ex-currency and acquisitions, what would they have been for the whole company, and then at the segment level, if you don't mind please?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Okay. For EIG, we had 26% operating margins. We were up 110 basis points, and excluding acquisitions, were 180 basis points, and the incrementals were about 50%. For EMG, the incrementals were around 20%. So, that includes the FX and M&A effect.","Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Got it. And then...","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Up 35%.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, and overall for the total business, it was about 35%. Good point, Bill.","Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Got it. Thank you. And then just into your prepared remarks, Dave, maybe if you could dig in a little bit more into what you're seeing in your UPT business, what end markets are driving that strength, how much backlog visibility you have there? Maybe some more color on that. And then might as well go ahead and just do the runaround the various end markets as well please.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right, right. Sure. I mean UPT businesses is just a fantastic story. Bruce Wilson is the Vice President and General Manager of the division, and he was acquired in the first acquisition I did as the Group President. And we've acquired other niche technology businesses on the nanotechnology space. We're measuring very small things and we do it very well. And we acquired Zygo, we acquired Creaform, and their broad end markets where precision manufacturing and you want to measure things that are very small with nanometric measurements.","So, it's in the optics market. There's a little bit of consumer market. There's precision manufacturing. So, it's a broad based. Military is broad based. They're firing on all cylinders with good new products. Creaform in particular is benefiting from a secular growth driver with their laser scanning 3D measurement. And this is just a well managed business and it's growing very nicely for us.","I'll go around the horn, start with our process businesses, go around the businesses. Our process business had a great quarter with overall sales up mid-teens. This growth was driven by high single-digit organic sales growth and the contributions from the recent MOCON and SoundCom acquisitions.","Organic growth remains broad based across our process businesses and reflects the strength of the niche leadership positions. We mentioned our UPT business. It did really well, growing low double digits in the quarter. Another business that grew low double digits was our Rauland business. Our Rauland-Borg business is doing really well. And for all of 2018, we continue to expect organic sales for process to be up mid-single digits.","Overall, aerospace sales were up mid-teens, driven by contributions from recently acquired FMH and mid-single-digit organic growth. We continue to see excellent commercial OEM and aftermarket growth as we have solid demand across our military business also. Our overall aerospace and defense businesses are well-positioned. They're balanced. Exposure across key market segments, commercial, business jets, military, aftermarket, and also diverse exposure across a wide range of legacy and next-generation platforms.","So, we're feeling great about that business for all of 2018 and we continue to expect organic sales for our aerospace businesses to be up mid-single digits with growth across each market segment.","Our overall sales for our power and industrial businesses were up 10% in the second quarter with mid-single-digit organic growth and the contributions from recent acquisitions. We saw broad-based growth across each of our power and industrial businesses, continued strong growth across our programmable power and VTI test and measurement businesses.","For all of 2018, we continue to expect organic sales for power and industrial to be up mid-single digits. And finally, our automation and engineered solutions had another excellent quarter, solid organic growth, up 10% organically. The excellent orders growth that we experienced across these businesses in recent quarters is translating into a very strong organic growth. And demand remains solid in both our automation and engineered solutions businesses, and for all of 2018, we now expect high single-digit organic growth for our automated and engineered solutions businesses. So, we increased that to high single digits for organic growth for the year. That's around the company. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, guys. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hi.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities","Can we touch on the execution? Very strong in EIG. Is there anything to be mindful of in terms of mix? It sounds like UPT is still going very strong, and that would sort of diminish that at this point you seem to be thinking about?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","I think EIG is just powering forward. I mean, it's a strong business. It's executing well. The orders ticked up a little bit sequentially. So, it's a positive outlook for the balance of the year. And our EMG business is executing well also. So, on the execution side, I'm feeling really good and our management teams are executing very well.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities","Perfect. And then just trying to reconcile the revenue outlook, it sounds like everything is going strong. You kept in the quarter somewhat of a range that you provide. Any reason sort of keeping that in? Is it just sort of conservatism as we enter the back half of the year and a lot of the uncertainty here?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, I think the mid-single-digit growth we had for the whole company organically in Q1, we got it mid-single, and we got it Q2 in mid-single. So, it doesn't pick up the fact that we move to the very high end of mid-single-digit. So, there was an increase in the guidance and that was driven largely by what happened in our automation and engineered solutions business and also what happened in the process side of our EIG business.","So, it was guided toward the high end of mid-single-digit, but you don't see that. We're feeling really good at how the year is playing out. We have terrific momentum. Our margins are expanding. Pricing is running well ahead of inflation. We have solid plan to minimize the impact of our tariffs. And all that said, it's a bit prudent for the second half to be cautious with some of the trade-related matter. But to be clear, Allison, we're seeing strong underlying demand and we're confident in our outlook.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities","Great. Thanks so much.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hi, Brett.","Operator","Brett Linzey, your line is now open.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, can you guys hear me okay?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, we can hear you, Brett.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah, okay. Yeah, so just back to the aerospace and defense. So, if we were to include FMH, how large from a revenue standpoint is that total business today? And then I guess separately if you just go platform-by-platform, what's in backlog, how much visibility do you have on those deliverables, whether it be months or years here in the coming quarters or so?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. Our total aerospace business is between $600 million and $700 million of revenue, and it has the best visibility in terms of backlog. That's the business we can look out. We have a lot of military business there and has firm backlog.","Then you get into the process business, where there's a mix of \u2013 it's really mid-cycle. Our automated and engineered solutions is mid-cycle. So, it's a combination of mid-cycle and long cycle. And our aerospace and power businesses really give us the best visibility looking into the future.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then I guess just back to just M&A and some of the accretion from deals announced this year, I guess as you look at synergies and projections into next year, what sort of a net accretion rollover we should be thinking about in 2019 from some of these step deals you closed in 2018?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, well, in entering 2018, it was a net of about $0.06. And we haven't finished our planning for 2019, but it's going to be a similar kind of number for 2019 is the best estimate at this time. But we'll firm that up as we get closer to the end of the year and when we put out our guidance for 2019.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. And then just one last one on Motec. Any color you can give in terms of profitability price paid multiple? Any detail there?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, sure, sure. The profitability of the business is pretty profitable business, low 20%s EBITDA margins. It was about 2.5 times sales. It was about 11 times year one EBITDA.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. I'll pass it along. Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hello, Bhupender.","Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Yeah, sitting in for Nigel here at Wolfe, and just had a question. I think it was asked earlier basically in the second half of your organic sales guidance. But, Dave, you did say there's some conservatism built in the second half with orders up like mid-single digits here. I don't know how going into July, you're kind of entering all this now, if you can talk about the trends you've seen, any slowdown from the traffic, tariff stuff, or anything on that sort?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","No, it's a good question, Nigel (sic) [Bhupender] (40:11). We have not seen any demand impact from the \u2013 no demand impact [ph] that end (40:18). And we're almost through July, and July looks really strong in terms of orders. So, right in line with our plan and no slowdown at all. So, we're feeling really good about the orders and the outlook, and we haven't seen a demand impact at this point.","Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And looks like with the Motec, you have a new platform here. If you can just give us some sense of where do you want to grow in this particular machine vision robotics space here again (40:53)?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. We have a business in the U.S. called ISC, and it's a natural fit with ISC, and it's complementary and adjacent market. So, ISC has customers in the U.S. that Motec doesn't have and Motec has customers in Europe that ISC doesn't have. And the demand ramp that Motec's going through is very, very extreme, and AMETEK is well-positioned to help them do that.","So, it's really a great business in a secular growth market, and as I said, the combination of the cameras for harsh environments, the video processing, and moving the video around a vehicle, or a transportation platform, and also the specific algorithms that let them improve processes and increase safety is really unique, and we're really optimistic about it.","Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, yeah. Again, Dave, I remember like when you acquired Rauland last year, you gave some market snapshot, the market growth in the health care business. Is there something kind of on a separate platform basis or is there a market size which you are looking at for Motec?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, right now, it is small enough that it will be with one of our existing businesses. But I could see this expanding into something bigger, and there's certainly more acquisitions that we're looking at in this space because we think it's a high growth space.","Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, got it. Cool. Thanks a lot.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Bhupender.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hey, guys, good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe. Just a quick question on military spending. I don't know if you're seeing any acceleration there as it pertains to the platforms, and I don't know if you can highlight anything on F-35 specifically? Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, with military spending, as we had mentioned on some prior calls, Tristan, it's really picked up and we're on a lot of legacy platforms and we're on a lot of new platforms. And in fact the F-35 is the largest single platform that AMETEK has won to-date. So, we're very bullish on the F-35. So, we're seeing continuing spending there and looking forward to satisfying the customer demands. And it's also not just the U.S. Military, but we have a business in the UK that serves the international markets. So, we're seeing a strong growth there also.","So, we're bullish on the military market. We have an outlook for mid-single-digit growth through this year. And it's still the largest part...","Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you, guys.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","It's the largest part of our Aerospace business. It's about 35% of it. So, it's substantial for us.","Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks. I'll join back the queue.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Danielle Lefland from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hi. It's actually Andrew Obin for Dani. Hi, guys. How are you?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hello, Andrew. Good.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Hi.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question, a broader question. As you guys think about CapEx trends, we've had the tax reform, we've had the tariffs. When you talk to the customers, do you think people are more likely to spend on CapEx going into 2019, less likely? Do you think your customers would be thinking how they're going to spend CapEx in the U.S.? Just what are you seeing?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","We're seeing good global growth. I mean the U.S. market for us was the strongest of our geographies. It was up 9% in Q2. And clearly tax reform has an impact, but customers aren't talking to us about tax reform. They're just talking about meeting demand. And we also saw strong growth in China. China was up 14% for us in the quarter, and high single digits and great in all of Asia, and we had mid-single digits in Europe.","So, we're not seeing any impact on the demand side, and most of the customers in the U.S. are benefiting from tax reform. And I think there are \u2013 with all the tariff discussions, I think most people are monitoring those, but it's not stopping them from going forward with business activity because the demand environment is so strong.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. So, if you were to guess what inning we are in terms of, sort of, CapEx cycle, once again talking to your customers, what would you guys guess?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, I would guess \u2013 my feeling is we went through an industrial recession in 2015 and 2016, and we're coming out of that and I think we're in the fourth inning.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. Yeah, sorry. Just a follow-up question. I think Fortive announced a series of deals, sort of, shifting their model sounds like on the margin more toward Roper has been doing. How do you guys think about sort of adding software longer-term to your portfolio? And I apologize if the question has been asked. I've been a little bit late.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Could you repeat the question, Andrew, the last part.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just the question, Fortive has announced software as a service acquisition, following another software as a service acquisition. It seems more industrial as sort of doing software deals. How do you guys think about software acquisitions going forward?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, I mean software is an important part of AMETEK's portfolio. A lot of our EIG businesses are niche leaders and softwares are critical components. So, we're certainly exploring opportunities and the business that we announced today, Motec, the software is critical to that business.","Our Rauland-Borg business that we purchased in Q1 of 2017, that business has a burgeoning enterprise software business. So, software is important to us and we are looking at the businesses that could help our existing businesses in that area.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific.

With that, I will turn the meeting over to Frank.","Frank S. Hermance","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, we established records for orders, operating income, operating margins, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Orders in the second quarter were a record at $916 million, up 15% from the prior year. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.11.","Sales in the second quarter were up 9% to $825.9 million. Internal growth was flat due to a weak international environment, while acquisitions added 10% and currency was a 1% headwind. Excluding the cost-driven motor business, which was impacted by weakness in Europe and the impact of a very difficult comparison in Asia, our internal growth was 3% in the quarter.","Operating income for the second quarter was superb. It increased 18% to a record $185 million from $157 million last year, reflecting the impact from our operational excellence activities and our longer cycle, higher-margin businesses.","Operating income margin in the quarter was a record at 22.4%, a 170 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2011. Net income was up 21% to $113.7 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.47 were up 21% over last year\u2019s second quarter and above the top end of our prior guidance of $0.45. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. ","Backlog at the end of the second quarter was over $1 billion, an all-time record high. Working capital management was excellent, operating working capital was 17.7% of sales.","Turning our attention to the individual operating groups, the electronic instruments group had a solid second quarter. Sales were up 11% to $452.1 million on strength in our aerospace, oil and gas, and power instruments businesses in addition to the contributions from the acquisitions of O\u2019Brien, TMC, EM Test, and Reichert Technologies. Internal growth was 1% while acquisitions added 12% and currency reduced sales by 2%. EIG\u2019s operating income increased 16% to $117.7 million and operating margins were very strong at 26%, up 110 basis points over last year\u2019s second quarter.","The electromechanical group also had a good quarter. Sales were up 6% to a record $373.8 million on strength in our differentiated businesses and the contributions from the acquisitions of Avicenna, Coining, and Dunkermotoren. Internal growth was down 1%. Acquisitions added 8%, and foreign currency reduced sales by 1%. ENG\u2019s operating income increased 14% to $78.8 million, a record level, and operating margins increased 140 basis points to a record 21.1%.","I\u2019d like to provide some perspective on the broader macroeconomic environment and what impact we are seeing on our business. We did see weakening in our business during the second quarter, in particular in Europe and Asia. Sales trends softened as customers turned cautious and delayed or pushed out shipments. Our process businesses, with approximately 70% of sales outside the U.S., had been impacted by the slowing as well as our cost-driven motors business, given its sizable European exposure. We now expect 2012 organic sales growth to be up low to mid-single digits versus our previous guidance of mid-single digits.","As we have demonstrated in the past, we will tighten our belts and aggressively manage our costs through this period of softness, while continuing to make investments in strategic acquisitions, market expansion, and new product development initiatives. In particular, our deal pipeline is strong and we will remain active in acquiring businesses.","We have put in place a number of cost containment actions across our businesses, which will benefit the second half of 2012. These actions, the contributions from acquired businesses, and the continued strength in our aerospace and oil and gas businesses have allowed us to increase our guidance for the year.","Focusing now on our four growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development, and acquisitions. Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our continual focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. The results we announced today reflect the impact of our various operational excellence initiatives as we were able to expand operating margins by 170 basis points to a record 22.4%.","At the beginning of the year, we targeted $60 million in cost savings from our various operational excellence initiatives, which include Lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back office operations, design for Six Sigma and our new product development efforts, movement of our production to low-cost locales, and global sourcing and strategic procurement. Approximately $40 million of these cost savings were targeted from global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. Given the softening we are seeing, we have increased our cost savings for 2012 from $60 million to $75 million. We are prepared to take further actions if necessary. ","Global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK\u2019s growth. In the second quarter of 2012 international sales represented 50% of our total sales. We continue to make investments in global and market expansion initiatives. The following are some examples of recent successes.","AMETEK Power Instruments was awarded an order for the supply of pressure transmitters for compressor surge applications in Russia. In compressor surge applications, the speed of response from the transmitter is critical, and therefore highly valued by the customer. Our pressure transmitter solution was ideally suited for this differentiated power application. This order represents Power Instruments\u2019 initial win in the local Russian marketplace.","Our Singapore MRO Aerospace business had a number of positive developments in the second quarter, including formally obtaining their Chinese CAAC repair station certification. This repair station certification allows us to provide repair services in support of Chinese aircraft operators, repair stations, and logistics suppliers. It also provides us broader access to the Asian aerospace repair market and further broadens the footprint of our global MRO operation.","In addition, our Singapore MRO business added a number of new repair capabilities, including helicopter, hydraulic servos, oxygen components, and aircraft brakes. This expanded set of repair capabilities allows us to provide our customers a wider range of MRO services. Lastly, it\u2019s worth noting that sales from our Singapore MRO business were up 42% in the second quarter of 2012, reflecting the tremendous work our global MRO team has done in establishing and growing their presence in this region. ","New product development is a key to our long term health and growth. We\u2019ve consistently invested in RD&E. In 2012 we expect to spend $155 million, a 13% increase over 2011. We\u2019re excited about some recent new product introductions. Our CAMECA business launched the IMS 7f-Auto, the latest evolution of their highly successful secondary ion mass spectrometer. This product measures the elemental composition of materials. ","The IMS 7f-Auto provides improved throughput for fully automated microanalysis, significantly increased the productivity of the lab environment and accelerating results. Product features ensure a high precision measurement, long term stability, and ease of use, thus enhancing the overall tool productivity. Performance of the IMS 7f-Auto is optimized for challenging applications such as glass, metal, ceramics, silicon-based devices, and both bulk materials and thin films.","Also in the second quarter, AMETEK Solid State Controls launched a new global uninterruptible power supply system called Digital Process Power 2. This system provides clean, regulated power for critical AC loads, and was designed for global process control and industrial applications. This new product opens up additional global market opportunities for our solid state controls business as it meets all global operating compliance standards. It complements the vast UPS product family of solid state controls and represents over $10 million in annual sales opportunity.","From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 23% of sales in the second quarter versus 21% in last year\u2019s second quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers.","Turning our attention to acquisitions, we had a very successful first half of 2012, with the acquisitions of O\u2019Brien in the first quarter and Dunkermotoren in the second quarter. We deployed nearly $500 million on these two acquisitions and acquired approximately $280 million in revenue. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2012 and beyond, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value, especially given the weakness in the global economy.","Our pipeline of deals remains robust, with an attractive mix of acquisition candidates, with a variety of sizes and markets and geographic concentrations. Our balance sheet is strong, our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity, and we have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisitions focus.","Turning now to the outlook for 2012, we expect our longer cycle aerospace, oil and gas, and power businesses to show continued strength throughout the balance of the year. We anticipate 2012 revenue to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis from 2011. Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups.","Earnings for 2012 are now expected to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.85 per diluted share, up 16-17% over 2011. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $1.80 to $1.83 per diluted share.","Third quarter 2012 sales are expected to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis from last year\u2019s third quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.45 to $0.46 per diluted share, up 13-15% over last year\u2019s third quarter. Our record backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2012.","So in summary, our overall businesses performed well in the second quarter. We are taking the necessary actions to ensure our cost structure is aligned with the slowing global economic environment. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth.","Before turning the call over to our new chief financial officer, Bob Mandos, to cover the financial details, I wanted to take a moment and acknowledge and thank our long term chief financial officer, John Molinelli, who retired on July 1. John had a highly successful 43-year career at AMETEK, the last 18 of which were as our chief financial officer. On behalf of everyone at AMETEK, I want to thank John for his outstanding contributions to the company over a long and distinguished career, and for the integral role he had in our company\u2019s success. We wish John all the best in his retirement.  ","It is now my pleasure to introduce Bob Mandos as our new chief financial officer. Bob has been with AMETEK for 31 years. Prior to being named CFO, Bob served as corporate comptroller since 1996. In this role, Bob was a key member of the senior management team and worked very closely with me, John Molinelli, and our group presidents in developing and executing our growth strategies and ensuring the veracity and quality of our financial information and financial reporting systems. ","In addition, Bob led the successful expansion of our corporate shared service operation and led the financial due diligence process for our acquisition strategy. Bob has done an outstanding job for AMETEK over a long period of time, and is uniquely qualified to take on the chief financial officer role. We wish Bob all the best in his new role. ","And with that introduction, let me turn it over to Bob to cover some of the financial details.","Bob Mandos","Thanks, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a strong second quarter, with excellent financial performance and a high quality of earnings. I will provide some further details. Growth in selling expenses was in line with growth in sales. General and administrative expenses were 1.4% of sales, below last year\u2019s second quarter level of 1.8% of sales, driven by the accelerated stock vesting in last year\u2019s second quarter and lower consulting spend this quarter.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.8%, down from last year\u2019s second quarter rate of 31.4%. We anticipate a tax rate of between 30% and 31% for the full year of 2012. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.","On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 17.7% of sales in the second quarter, essentially in line with last year\u2019s second quarter, reflecting the continued efforts of our teams to reduce our investment here. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. ","Capital spending was $12 million for the quarter. Full year 2012 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $60 million. Depreciation and amortization was $26 million for the quarter. 2012 depreciation and amortization is estimated to be approximately $108 million. In the quarter, operating cash flow was $116 million, and free cash flow was $104 million. Operating cash flow in the first half of 2012 was $257 million, up 17% from the first half of 2011, and free cash flow was $236 million for the first half of 2012, representing 105% of net income. For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income.  ","Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy, where we expended approximately $500 million in the first half of 2012. Total debt was $1.51 billion at June 30, up $248 million from year end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $164 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at June 30 of 37%, up from 35% at the end of 2011. At June 30, we had approximately $655 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. ","In summary, we had a solid second quarter, establishing records for essentially all the key operating metrics. We are well-positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows. ","Frank S. Hermance","Great, thank you Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll now open it up for questions.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. ","Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo","Frank, you talked about aerospace being strong for you, but we\u2019re certainly hearing concerns about the aftermarket on the commercial side. Could you give any color around that, and what you\u2019re seeing there specifically? ","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, actually our aftermarket business is doing quite well. We had very strong performance in the second quarter, and we actually are expecting that to continue. I know that some other companies have been talking about, in particular in Europe, their aftermarket business being weak. So I took an extra special look at that, and in fact our business is good. We are gaining share in that part of the world, and as a result even though the economy is a little bit weaker, it looks pretty good. So we\u2019re forecasting for this entire year it\u2019s going to be up high single-digits organically for the year or so. We feel pretty good about it. ","Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo","Great. And then obviously margins have been spectacular, and you\u2019ve been outpacing what you sort of guided to at the beginning of the year. In addition, more cost savings coming out. How should we be thinking about margins as we head to the back of the year here for you guys? ","Frank S. Hermance","In the last conference call we had raised guidance up to 40 basis points for the full year and we\u2019re conservatively now saying up 60 basis points. So the margins have just been spectacular in the company and our operating people are doing just a first class job in terms of managing their P&L. So we\u2019re very pleased with that, and we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re able to raise that guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of R. Scott Graham with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question. ","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company ","The question I just had for you, Frank, is the typical synopsis across both segments, really, just kind of by market, how you typically do that. ","Frank S. Hermance","Let\u2019s start with aerospace. Our overall aerospace continued to performance very well in the second quarter. We had double digit organic sales growth, essentially on broad-based strength across all parts of our aerospace business. We expect to see continued solid growth for aerospace in 2012 as trend in order rates, OEM build rates, revenue passenger miles, and our program wins really support strong commercial third-party MRO and also business and regional jet sales. Surprisingly, our military business also performed well in the second quarter and that\u2019s two quarters now in a row where it essentially has outperformed. ","So if we look for all of 2012, we are expecting our commercial and third-party MRO businesses to be up high single-digits. We expect our business in regional jets to be up low double-digits. And our military business is now expected to be up low single digits. So for overall aerospace, we should be up organically in that mid to high single-digits, and we\u2019re obviously trending more toward the higher single digits now. ","Moving on to our process businesses, our process businesses performed well in the second quarter, with sales up low double-digits. Our oil and gas business continued to show sizable strength while our advanced measurement technology division was also very strong. Overall growth benefited from the Reichert Technologies, TMC, and O\u2019Brien acquisitions while organic growth was flat in the quarter due to weak international performance. Business remains solid in the U.S. for our process businesses. And for all of 2012, we expect this business to grow low double-digits on a percentage basis overall with low to mid single digit organic growth. In particular we expect continued strong performance from our later cycle oil and gas business.","Moving to the power and industrial part of EIG, overall second quarter sales were up high single-digits, driven by the contribution from the EM Test acquisition. Our power instruments and industrial businesses showed particular strength with core growth of high single-digits for power instruments and mid-teens for industrial. Core growth of our programmable power division was negative due to large sales last year to a major semiconductor company. For all of 2012, we expect sales for power and industrial to be up low double-digits overall and mid-single digits organically, driven by the balanced growth that I mentioned across power and industrial. So if you sum up all of EIG, we expect 2012 sales to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis with organic growth of low to mid single digits. ","For EMG, I\u2019ll start with the differentiated part of EMG. This part of the company performed well. Overall sales were up low double-digits in Q2 while organic sales were up low single digits. Strong growth from our third-party MRO and military businesses, along with the contributions from Avicenna technology, Coining, and Dunkermotoren. Those acquisitions really drove the overall growth. For 2012, we expect this business to be up approximately high teens overall, with organic growth of mid-single digits. ","And the last part of the company, our legacy business, cost-driven motors, sales were down organically mid teens in the second quarter due to weakness in Europe. About 50% of our cost-driven motors business is in Europe. We believe the organic growth will improve in the second half, of the cost-driven motor business, and therefore for 2012 we expect sales to be down about mid-single digits over 2011.","So if you sum these two parts of EMG, for all of EMG we expect overall sales to be up low double-digits and organic growth to be up low to mid single digits. And for the company, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we expect low double-digit sales growth on a percentage basis with organic growth of low to mid single digits, which is down a bit from our guidance of mid-single digits previously in terms of organic growth for the company, reflecting obviously the weaker international marketplace. And in essence, the first half organic growth rate will about equal the second half organic growth rate that\u2019s in our forecast.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. ","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","I had a question about the organic growth. It looks like you\u2019re looking for a pickup versus the Q2 rates. I\u2019m just wondering how the comps play there. It sounded like you had a little bit of a lumpy comp in the second quarter. And maybe by segment, same question. ","Frank S. Hermance","Definitely we had a somewhat difficult comp in the second quarter. It was predominantly in Asia on the comp. We had very strong sales last year to multiple semiconductor customers and also the Fukushima situation last year caused us to have high sales in the particular quarter. Some of that will spill over into the third quarter, but we expect the third quarter to be essentially low single digits in terms of organic growth and we expect the fourth quarter to be mid-single digits. And there is an easier comparison in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s why we feel the second half organics will be about the same as the first half organics.  ","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","And then nice to see the pickup in the vitality index to 23%. Some companies, lower specification than you, cite a little bit higher rate there. Maybe they define it differently, obviously, but just wondering if maybe you think you use a stricter budgeting process for returns on new products? ","Frank S. Hermance","Right. It\u2019s a great question, and when we first instituted this vitality index, we tried to come up with a common definition of what a new product is across the company. And it was extremely difficult to do, because we have such a variety of different businesses, some very short cycle, some very long cycle. So what we ended up doing is saying to each of our operating entities, you decide on the definition, but you can\u2019t change it. So therefore, I would rely more on the relevance change in our vitality index versus the absolute level of it.","And I can tell you, we\u2019ve kept this definition over the last 10 years, and when we started measuring it, it was at a 10% level. This 23% level, I believe, is a record high. Bob is shaking his head yes. I don\u2019t recall one this high. And the key point is it was up from 21% in last year\u2019s second quarter. So we\u2019re definitely getting a lot more productivity out of the engineering dollar that we\u2019re spending. We feel we\u2019re spending the right amount in terms of percent of sales, and so we\u2019re really focused on the productivity of that dollar, which this vitality index is an indicator of. ","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","So it sounds like, given the margin upside, you\u2019re not intent on liberalizing the budget? ","Frank S. Hermance","You mean going with more in terms of new product development expense? Is that what you mean? ","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Yes. ","Frank S. Hermance","My guess is we will see that inch up as the year goes on. And we\u2019ll see how the third quarter feels, and we probably will inch that up some. ","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","And just lastly, with the softer environment, seeing any impact on the pace of individual deal negotiations? ","Frank S. Hermance","This is the first time I can say - or maybe I said it in the last conference call - for a number of quarters prior to this, I had not been feeling that pricing was showing a downward trend. And I\u2019m starting to feel that now. I\u2019m feeling deals are more reasonable. We did close the Dunkermotoren deal at 8x trailing in the second quarter. The O\u2019Brien deal in the first quarter was 9x trailing. So I think there is some reaction to the slowing. I probably don\u2019t have enough data points to fully quantify it, but it just feels a bit better now than what it has.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets ","Frank, maybe you can just kind of walk us through the geographies - U.S., Europe, Asia, BRIC countries - and sort of what you observed in organic growth this quarter? ","Frank S. Hermance","It\u2019s an interesting picture. The U.S. was fine. It was up in the 2-3% kind of region. The European organic growth was actually flat, but there\u2019s a difference between the various parts of the business, where on the EMG side of the business, Europe was - the floor care motor business, as I mentioned in some of my opening remarks - very, very weak. And that drove the organic growth of EMG down. ","For the company, in Asia it was actually our weakest performance. That was down 5%. But that was due to the factors that I mentioned in terms of the very tough comparisons to last year. So as I said, I think those organic growths will show an improving trend through the second half. But actually Asia was the worst, which is I think the first time I can remember Asia having the worst organic growth rate in the company in a long, long time. So there\u2019s definitely some softening going on there, but more so than that, it was a tough comparison. ","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets ","And then how about the rest of the BRIC regions? How did those perform? ","Frank S. Hermance","They performed okay. China, obviously, is the largest part of our BRIC region. Russia was strong. Brazil was okay. They were fine. China is the driver here. ","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets ","And I think you mentioned some international process softness as well. Is that speaking to the Asian observation there that you mentioned? ","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, that is correct. ","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets ","And then maybe you can just talk a little bit in more detail on kind of what the initiatives are on the cost containment side that are getting you that extra $15 million this year? ","Frank S. Hermance","Basically, we have increased substantially the amount of savings we\u2019re going to get in the procurement activities that we have. So we\u2019re going to go up another, say, half of that $15 million is the result of sourcing activities. The remaining half is a combination of some targeted reduction in forces, and some belt-tightening across the company. ","We\u2019re reacting in a manner that\u2019s consistent with a sort of slowing of the top line. We\u2019re not feeling that we\u2019re going to have some major issue on the top line, but we just decided - and I think you know our culture quite well here - that we tend to react as soon as we see softening, so we decided to react and put these in place. And we\u2019re going to watch the business. If things soften more, then we will take some more significant actions to ensure the profitability of the company. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of D. Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please proceed. ","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research ","What is the payables number? ","Bob Mandos","$300 million. ","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research ","Frank, you were talking about the M&A environment and prices coming down, but with that, are you also taking down what you\u2019re willing to pay for deals as well? Is there still kind of a disconnect, or not? ","Frank S. Hermance","No, I\u2019m feeling relatively comfortable with the multiples, where they are now. And what we were doing when I felt some of the deals were a bit higher than we wanted to pay is we were parsing the deals to acquire those companies where we had more than the norm of cost synergies in those businesses. So we always keep the same return type of metrics, irrespective of what the pricing is. So the fact that they\u2019re lower now, a little bit, in terms of the sales price, we\u2019ll probably get better returns on those deals. ","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research ","And then you said the book-to-bill was 1.11? ","Frank S. Hermance","Yes.","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research ","That\u2019s pretty strong. How were those orders splitting, say, between Q3 and Q4? Is a lot of that baked into Q4? Some longer cycle businesses? ","Frank S. Hermance","Yeah. I mean, a good part of that increase was due to backlog that we acquired from Dunkermotoren. Because that was a fairly large deal. And obviously when you acquire the backlog, it goes into the order number. So there was a sizable piece due to that deal. And that will ship in Q3 and in Q4, with stronger sales in Q4 than in Q3. ","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research ","So can you back out what was the organic book to bill? ","Frank S. Hermance","It was roughly the same as sales. It was roughly flat for the same reasons we talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Please proceed. ","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Frank, I was wondering if you could spend a couple additional moments talking about some of the other end markets outside of oil and gas and semiconductor in the process group of businesses, what you\u2019re seeing domestic, internationally. You typically parse it into maybe four or five buckets. Can you do that? ","Frank S. Hermance","Are you talking about the process businesses in particular? ","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Yes, the process piece only, really.  ","Frank S. Hermance","Well, if you look at the breakdown of that business, about a third is in oil and gas, about 25% is in instrumentation related to metals, about 20% is in research and sort of development kinds of applications, and then the remaining whatever it is, 22%, is just in a varied number of industries. And obviously the third that was oil and gas remained very, very strong in the quarter. If you look at the number of worldwide rigs it\u2019s around 3,500, which is near an all-time high. We\u2019re impervious to whether it\u2019s oil or gas rigs, as long as people are drilling. So we think that segment is going to continue to do fine. ","The part of the business that\u2019s linked to metals has a very large portion of their business in international and as a result it was weaker. And it went in the opposite direction from an organic viewpoint to the oil and gas business. And the research environment was mixed. We had some parts that were very, very strong, some parts that weren\u2019t. But the key driver to the process business is the fact that 70% of those businesses are outside the U.S., and that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the weakness, and that\u2019s also where we have the tough comparison.  ","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets","As you progressed through the quarter, did your organic book-to-bill change much from month to month? I guess I\u2019m trying to get a feel for where your rate entering the quarter would have been versus exiting. ","Frank S. Hermance","Actually, it\u2019s going to be a little contrary to what you\u2019re probably expecting the answer to this question to be, in that it actually increased during the quarter. It was the lowest in the first month and it went up for the second two months, and was about the same in the second and the third month in the quarter.","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And our next question comes from the line of Richard C. Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. ","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Frank, just to do the quick math on the core orders growth rate, it looks like it was up maybe 3% or 4%. Is that the right math? ","Frank S. Hermance","It was a little weaker than that. It wasn\u2019t up quite 3-4%. ","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird","And when you look at that book-to-bill, just in general, excluding Dunker, does your backlog also favor the fourth quarter? Is that how we get that kind of mid single digit four?","Frank S. Hermance","It definitely favors the fourth quarter. In particular, our fourth quarter in aerospace is always our strongest quarter, and as you know the backlog in aerospace has the longest cycle to it. So there\u2019s definitely a preponderance, or a larger percentage, of that backlog that will ship in the fourth quarter. And as I said before, in fairness on the organic side, the fourth quarter also has some lower comps on, in particular, the floor care motor business. ","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird","And then also, is price, just generally speaking, holding up? I know when we entered this year, we felt that we could be fairly aggressive on price given our growth assumptions or our outlook at that time. Is price at least holding up? Or are there any of the businesses starting to require you to price a little more aggressively for the volumes? ","Frank S. Hermance","Pricing is okay. It was up in that 1-2 point region. So price is still okay. We\u2019re not seeing any substantial change in the pricing environment. That could change over the next couple quarters, but right now it looks okay.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.

I'll now turn the meeting over to Frank.","Frank Hermance","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. AMETEK had an excellent second quarter with very strong execution of our four growth strategies. In the quarter, we established records for all key financial metrics including orders, sales, operating income, operating margins, net income and diluted EPS.","Additionally, we ended the second quarter with a record backlog of $1.25 billion. We remained very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of Zygo Corporation and acquired Luphos, a technology acquisition which is highly synergistic with Zygo and our Taylor Hobson and metrology businesses.","Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired Amptek, a provider of instrumentation used to identify composition of materials used in x-ray fluorescence. I will provide more details on our continued strong acquisition activity in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter.","Sales in the quarter were up 13% to $990.7 million, organic sales increased 4%, while acquisitions added 8% and currency added 1%. Operating income for the second quarter was very strong. It increased 14% to $231.7 million from $202.6 million last year.","Operating income margin in the quarter was a record 23.4%, a 30 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2013. Net income and diluted earnings per share were both up 17% over last year\u2019s second quarter to 150.1 cents and $0.61 respectively.","Our diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. Orders in the second quarter were very strong at $1.1 billion, up 21% overall from the prior year driven by solid organic growth and the contributions from recent acquisitions. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.09.","Operating cash flow was $155 million for the second quarter up 21% from last years\u2019 first quarter \u2013 second quarter, excuse me and operating working capital was excellent at 17.7% of sales.","Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The electronic instruments had an excellent quarter. Sales were up 19% to $573.3 million on strength and our ultra precision technologies and material analysis businesses plus the contributions from the acquisitions of Controls Southeast, Creaform, Powervar, Teseq, and VTI. Organic sales were up 4%, acquisition s added 14% and foreign currency was a 1% tailwind.","EIG's operating income increased 17% to $151.5 million, and operating margins were 26.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact on operating margins of recent acquisitions, EIG's operating margins were 27.6%, up 80 basis points from last year's second quarter.","The Electromechanical Group had a great quarter as well with strong operating performance. Sales were up 6% to $417.4 million. Organic sales were up 4%, and foreign currency added 2%. Growth was broad-based with particular strength in our precision motion control and engineered materials interconnect and packaging businesses.","EMG's operating income increased 10% to $92.1 million, and operating margins were superb at 22.1% up 100 basis from last year\u2019s second quarter at a record level.","Now turning to our four growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development, and strategic acquisitions.","First, I will touch on acquisitions. We continue to remain very active as evidenced by our record M&A activity over the past 12 months. With the Zygo, Luphos and Amptek acquisitions, we have now acquired eight businesses over the last 12 months, deployed nearly $1 billion in capital, and acquired approximately $460 million in revenue.","Thus far in 2014, we have deployed approximately $570 million in capital and acquired over $285 million in sales on five acquisitions. Importantly, our acquisition pipeline remains very strong.","Now let me provide some highlights on the three recent acquisitions. We completed the acquisition of Zygo on June 20th. Total capital deployed on the acquisition was approximately $280 million net of cash acquired. Zygo has annual sales of approximately $165 million.","Zygo is truly a great strategic fit with AMETEK. We are very excited about this acquisition and are pleased to welcome the Zygo team to AMETEK. Zygo is a leading provider of non-contact metrology solutions, high precision optics and optical assemblies for use in semiconductor, medical, life sciences, industrial, and aerospace and defense end-markets.","They have a high value, differentiated technology capability, along with a strong brand within the optical and metrology markets. Zygo\u2019s leading position in non-contract optical metrology directly complements our strength in contract metrology, expanding our capabilities in this very attractive market.","As previously indicated, we expect sizable synergy through elimination of public company, costs, sourcing savings, and through leveraging our global infrastructure. Also in the second quarter, we acquired Luphos, a small, yet highly strategic technology acquisition. Luphos provides us with exciting technology which is highly complementary to our existing metrology technology.","Luphos\u2019s core technology is used in the measure of complex aspheric optical surfaces through non-contract methods. Our Taylor Hobson metrology business provides similar measurement capabilities through contact metrology technology. So this way, we really have both technology capabilities either non-contact or contact metrology capabilities.","The addition of Luphos expands our metrology capabilities across a broader range of surface finishes and profiles, thereby providing our customers a broader product portfolios to serve their various applications and they are headquartered outside of Frankfurt, Germany.","Lastly, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Amptek. Amptek is a privately held manufacturer of instrumentation and detectors used to identify the composition of materials using x-ray fluorescence. Amptek\u2019s products are sold to OEMs that manufacture non-destructive testing devices to measure element of composition in metal production, pharmaceutical products, electronics and environmental samples.","Amptek is another excellent strategic acquisition for us as it provides us with attractive sensor and detector technology as well as strong R&D developments capabilities which will help to accelerate future technology developments for our served markets.","In addition, Amptek Detector Technology opens up new market and application opportunities in bench top and life sciences applications. They are headquartered in Bedford Mass and have annual sales of approximately $30 million and they are a very, very profitable company.","Now, turning to global and market expansion. Global and market expansion continues to be a key driver for our growth as we are increasingly expanding our presence in attractive higher growth market segments and geographic regions. In the second quarter of 2014, international sales represented 56% of our total sales, and this was up from 54% of sales in the second quarter of 2013.","The increase in international sales percentage was driven by strong organic growth in Asia and the benefit from recent acquisitions. Organic sales in Asia were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the second quarter, with broad-based strength across our businesses.","This strong growth reflects the benefits of our continued focus on expanding our sales, service and distribution capabilities in this region. We will continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities, and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities.","Now, turning to new product developments. New product development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long-term health in growth. We have consistently grown our investment in RD&E to ensure we are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets.","In 2014, we expect to spend approximately $210 million, a 17% increase over 2013. And we are excited about some recent new product introductions.","Creaform, which we acquired in 2013, is a leader in portable 3D scanning technology. During the second quarter, Creaform introduced two new portable 3D scanners. The Go!SCAN 3D and the HandySCAN 3D, that represents breakthroughs in terms of speed accuracy and versatility.","The Go!SCAN 3D is a white light scanner that offers accurate, high speed scanning of practically any object and it\u2019s suitable for engineering and CAD projects that require full color 3D models or direct scan to print capabilities.","The HandySCAN 3D is a metrology grade laser scanner that achieves ground-breaking accuracy resolution in measurement rates, operating 25 times faster than previous versions. This truly a breakthrough kind of product. The HandySCAN 3D is suitable for all stages in the product developments life cycle from design, prototyping, testing, assembly, production and quality control.","Both the Go!SCAN 3D and the HandySCAN 3D rely on Creaform\u2019s new VX application software to quickly and seamlessly integrate digital scans into 3D printing or CAD process applications.","Creaform is seeing extremely strong growth in 2014 through the success of their new product introductions and their market expansion efforts. AMETEK\u2019s ORTEC product group introduced a number of new products including a new series of high purity germanium detectors, the profile S and C series.","These new radiation detector products provide exceptional resolution across the entire energy range while also improving efficiency at the lower energies. Further cementing ORTEC\u2019s leading position and nuclear radiation detection and identification systems.","ORTEC also launched their PINS3 Portable Chemical Identification System leveraging our experience with radiation detection, this new product safely and quickly identifies hazardous chemicals inside munitions or chemical storage containers by conducting non-destructive gamma ray analysis.","The system is completely portable for liquid nitrogen or shielded radioactive sources. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 22% of sales in the second quarter up from 21% in the last year\u2019s quarter.","Lastly, I\u2019ll touch on OpEx, we continue to see tremendous results from our various operational excellence initiatives. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving operational improvements through their businesses, leveraging the numerous operational excellence tools we have in place throughout the company.","Key tenets of our operational excellence activities include Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, Design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, moving our production to low-cost locales and value engineering.","Through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, we recognized $18 million in savings in the second quarter and as a result of the continued strong efforts of our team.","We now expect approximately $95 million in total cost savings in 2014 through our operational excellence initiatives including $65 million in savings through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. This is up from $90 million in total cost that we targeted at the end of the first quarter.","Turning to the outlook, for the remainder of 2014, we continue to expect our businesses to show solid growth during 2014 with balanced organic growth across both operating groups. We now anticipate 2014 revenue to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis from 2013 reflecting continued solid core growth and the contribution from recent acquisitions.","Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid-single-digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2014 and 2013 excluding one-time Zygo integration costs are expected to be incurred in the third and fourth quarter. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $2.32 to $2.37 and reflects stronger operating performance, plus the benefits from the Zygo acquisition.","Third quarter 2014 sales are expected to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis from last year's second quarter with organic growth up low to mid single-digits. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.59 to $0.61 per diluted share, up 13% to 17% over last year's third quarter excluding one-time Zygo integration costs.","So in summary, we delivered exceptional performance in the quarter. Our results and increased guidance for 2014 reflect the continued strong execution of our growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy.","Our excellent backlog, strong portfolios of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions, should enable us to perform extremely well for the remainder of 2014.","Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bob?","Robert Mandos","Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had an excellent second quarter with strong overall results. I will provide some further details.","Core growth in selling expenses was in line with core growth in sales in the quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales, in line with last year's second quarter.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%, versus last year's second quarter rate of 29.4% and in line with our guidance. The lower tax rate in the quarter was a result of our ongoing international tax planning activities. For 2014, we expect our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.","On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 17.7% of sales in the second quarter versus 17.9% in last year\u2019s second quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority.","Capital expenditures were $15 million for the quarter, for the full year of 2014, capital expenditures are expected to be $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $33 million for the quarter, full year 2014 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $142 million.","Operating cash flow was $155 million in the second quarter, up 21% over last year\u2019s second quarter. Free cash flow was $140 million in the quarter, up 19 over last year\u2019s second quarter.. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 110% of net income.","Total debt was $1.6 billion at June 30, up $188 million from the 2013 year end largely the result of the Zygo acquisition. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $283 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at June 30 of 27.8%.","At June 30, we had approximately $700 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Zygo Corporation and acquired Luphos bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2014 to approximately $570 million.","Also in the second quarter, we announced a 50% increase in it from $0.06 per share. This dividend increase will raise the annualize dividend payout to $0.36 per share.","In summary, we had a very strong second quarter, establishing records for essentially all key financial metrics, strong balance sheet and cash flows.","Frank Hermance","Great. Thank you, Bob. Susie, we'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of John Baliotti with Janney Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Baliotti \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning. Frank, I was wondering, I was kind of looking at, maybe focusing on M&A a little bit. I was just, you continue, cash continues to go up in your balance sheet and you continue to do deals and your working capital as a percent of sales continues to go down or certainly stay in line despite the deals.","I was wondering, is there a way to quantify how much of deals that you are doing right now or funded by improvements \u2013 and now that the businesses that you have bought, but the businesses that have been core to AMETEK over the years?","Frank Hermance","Yes, I think the best way look at this, John, is that the majority of the savings that we get and the improvements we get are in the existing businesses, but the existing businesses would include what we acquired in the previous year, not what we acquired this year.","And we obviously look at both the acquired companies as well as the existing businesses, but because the existing businesses are so much larger in totality, the majority of the improvements come from the existing business \u2013 but we are able to offset that with the existing business improvements and sort of the year that we acquire the company.","But then in succeeding years we will work very aggressively to improve the working capital of those acquired companies. So, I think the focus and sort of the real answer to your question is that as the existing business is where the majority of this is coming from including the acquisitions from the previous year.","John Baliotti \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Right, and just a follow-on to that, it seems like \u2013 and I think in the past you\u2019ve said that, even though you have a rigorous M&A team and a due diligence process, you tend to sort of scatter your deals for lack of a better term in different areas.","But it seems like, of the last seven deals, if I have it right about five of them have been more in the metrology, whether it\u2019s contact or non-contact, if you throw to include Creaform in there as complementary to that, I was just wondering, is there \u2013 is it greater confidence or interest in that area or is just randomness?","Frank Hermance","It\u2019s more randomness in terms of where the deals come from, John and when you look at where those deals went, although your macro view is absolutely correct that are in these sort of metrology areas. Where they end up in AMETEK is different. For instance, the Amptek acquisition is going to end up in our materials analysis division, where Zygo is ending up in our ultra precision technology division.","So, it may seem like, they are all going in the same place, but they are not. We have an internal thought process that we don\u2019t like to do two acquisitions in the same business unit. We might do it in the same division but it would be in different business units just to reduce the risk and only on a few occasions have we not adhered to that.","John Baliotti \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Great, thanks, Frank, and congratulations.","Frank Hermance","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, good morning guys.","Frank Hermance","Hello, Allison.","Robert Mandos","Hi, Allison.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","I am just sort of riding on that product portfolio question and sort of the ultra precision technology, you\u2019ve done a lot of acquisitions there. Is, outside of sort of organic ideas, is that product portfolio filled out or do you certainly need more immediate end-markets or a different technology there?","Frank Hermance","Yes, we have now done a really superb job of putting key technology into this particular business. So four of the markets that we are focusing on \u2013 we now have an excellent portfolio of technologies and we really don\u2019t need additional technologies for that market.","However, we can expand the market penetration of UPT and go into other markets and that\u2019s pretty much the strategy that we have used across the company that we get into an area, we fill out the technologies and capabilities for grid access to specific niche markets and then we were on adjacencies that are around that that are really new market segments and we can do that either through acquisition or we can do it through basically internal developments.","And I think you may have heard me talk previously about sort of the finger approach which is the way we think about how we bring the deals into AMETEK and every time we do a sizable acquisition it opens up another set of fingers that we can basically add on either additional acquisitions or additional markets through \u2013 or internal R&D activities.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Frank Hermance","You bet.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","And then just a lot of moving parts obviously on the EBIT line with the acquisition, so how should be we thinking about that, maybe EIG versus AMG in the back half of the year?","Frank Hermance","Well, as we\u2019ve talked about these \u2013 if you look at the margins, the margins in EIG are very, very good. They were at 26.4% in the quarter and EMG is where the margin opportunity is and we continue to do really well on those margins. EMG was a 22.1% if my recollection is correct which was up 100 basis points.","So, as we go forward, you are going to see more margin improvement coming out of EMG than EIG and again, through sort of randomness of the acquisitions, a large number of the acquisitions we\u2019ve done in the last say couple of years have ended up in EMG or excuse me, EIG and therefore there tends to be a bit of a dilutive impact on the margins in EIG.","We actually consider that positive because what we want to do with those acquired companies is actually buy businesses that have lower margins and make them better. And therefore the return on invested capital turns out to be superb. But we\u2019ve always been able to outgrow that as a company.","In other words, our margins are \u2013 the 30 basis points we are talking about includes, all of the dilution of the acquisitions and if we extract it out the 30 basis would be up in the 70, 80 basis points area, just to sort of put some numbers on it. So, that\u2019s probably the best way I can answer your question, Allison.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Great. Thank you so much.","Frank Hermance","You bet.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is coming from line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Morning.","Frank Hermance","Hi, Matt.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","With respect to the core business, Frank, I think you talked about orders been up total 21%. Can you talk about what that looks like organically give the actual number is well if what your sort of core backlog looks like on a year-over-year basis?","Frank Hermance","Yes, I think, I\u2019ll try to do that off the top of my head and Bob, you can correct me if I don\u2019t have exactly the right numbers here. But the organic growth in orders was in the 2%, 3% kind of area. If we look at the backlogs, the backlog was $1.25 billion and the most significant contributor to that was Zygo and Zygo was $83 million. Did I get those numbers right?","Robert Mandos","","You got it.","Frank Hermance","I got them right. Okay.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","And then, with respect to \u2013 you\u2019ve obviously done a lot of M&A in the last 12 months and it sounds you are going to exclude the integration costs related to Zygo, but can you quantify the inventory step-up cost, the other acquisition expenses transaction costs that are still flowing through the P&L in aggregate for 2014?","Frank Hermance","Yes, we have not yet finalized exactly what the integration cost of Zygo are going to be going forward and we are in the process of working with the Zygo team to refine that and by the next conference call, I\u2019ll be able to quantify those for you.","But they won\u2019t be minor and the reason is, you may recall, Matt, that we are looking for synergy in this deal that is extremely large. And we think there is tremendous synergy between, in particular the Zygo operation or Zygo business and AMETEK.","And that\u2019s the reason why we did exclude those costs in our forward-looking guidance and we will get it quantified \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s not sort of a material number, it will probably be on the order of $0.04 something like that in that kind of region but it has not been finalized.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","And then, just a follow-up Frank, with respect to all the other deals you\u2019ve done, there is inventory step-up costs, there is transaction costs, what is indeed flowing through the P&L that you are not calling out as one-time?","Frank Hermance","Okay, well, I can give you some numbers for the second quarter. For instance, in the second quarter we had $1.6 million of costs that were used in terms of acquiring Zygo. Okay, and we are sort of separating those costs from going forward integration costs and that $1.6 million was in the P&L and we are just absorbing that.","So our earnings would have been \u2013 if we excluded that, it would have been $1.6 million higher and it was a very similar number in the first quarter for Zygo. So, just in that six months for one acquisition, we are talking $3.2 million which is basically a penny a share which we have absorbed. And then there are other costs associated with the other deals but they are relatively small in comparison.","Matt Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great. Thank you, Frank.","","Frank Hermance","You bet, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Hey, good morning, Frank, Bob, Kevin.","Frank Hermance","Hi, Scott.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Just somebody has to ask it, so Frank, hopefully you can go through your by business unit analysis for us, particularly, give us maybe a little bit more color than normal if possible on EMET which is the kind of first time we\u2019ve kind of mentioned that possibly in some time?","Frank Hermance","Yes, now I\u2019d be glad to do that, Scott. Just put a star there. So I\u2019ve got some notes, so I normally do regarding the business sort of sub-segments and I\u2019ll start with EIG. EIG aerospace business really had an excellent quarter, high single-digit organic sales growth and the growth was driven by our business and regional jet business along with continued strength in commercial aerospace.","We really expect continued strong performance in this EIG aerospace business throughout 2014 and the trends in OEM build rates for excellent commercial sales, while the continued ramp up that we\u2019ve talked about before Scott, in key business and regional jet platforms, will drive significant demand for us, even though the business and regional jet market has not yet rebounded in a similar or in the way that commercial market has rebounded.","So what we are estimating for all of 2014 is that EIG aerospace should be up at least mid single-digits. But process businesses also had a great quarter. Overall sales were up mid-teens on a percentage basis and organic sales were up mid single-digits. Overall growth was driven by very good core growth in ultra precision technologies.","And material analysis divisions, the two we just talked about a few moments ago, combined with obviously the strong acquisitions we did in this segment which were Control Southeast, Creaform and VTI. For the full year, we expect our process businesses grow mid-teens overall with organic growth up low to mid-single digits.","And again, I think it\u2019s going to be pressing more towards the mid than the low. And the last part of EIG is power and industrial sales for that part of the business was up more than 30% in the second quarter and that growth was driven by the contributions from the acquisitions of Powervar and Teseq as well as mid single-digit organic growth.","And we expect overall sales for power and industrial to be up approximately 30% in 2014 and organic growth up low to mid single-digits. So, this business is definitely turning upwards now for us which is very, very good. Obviously the aerospace and process businesses have been up and moving higher for a sustained basis, but the power business is now starting to show some strength.","So if you sum those three parts of EIG, for all of EIG, we expect 2014 sales to be up high teens on a percentage basis with organic growth up that low to mid single-digits. And moving to the second part of the company, EMG, our differentiated businesses had a very solid quarter with overall sales up mid single-digits organically on a percentage basis.","And that strong growth came from our precision motion control and engineered materials interconnect and packaging business. And Scott, you asked me to spend a little bit of time on the engineered material interconnect and packaging businesses, we have been talking about that business turning around, it didn\u2019t turn around quite as quickly as we thought it was going to, but definitely now it has turned the corner.","You may remember that part of this business is involved with alloys that are used in titanium production that go into air craft and there was a situation where there was a lot of inventory in the supply chain and we thought this was going to clear but it is now cleared and we are basically seeing the results of that.","The other really good thing here is that this team has really embraced our international strategy and have done a lot of work in selling their products now outside the United States. This was a largely US business and it\u2019s rapidly now moving more in line with the rest of the company where a significant part of their business is outside the United States.","So you sum it up. We just had that team in here and you can see a smile on their faces which is great. And to finish then with the differentiated businesses, if you sum this up, we are expecting low to mid single-digit organic growth for all of 2014 obviously with a stronger growth in the second part of the year.","And, the last part of the company is floor care and specialty motors. Sales in floor care and specialty motors were up low single-digits in the quarter. So continued good performance there and that team expects sales for their business to be up low single digits organically for all of 2014.","So, if you look at all of EMG then, and take what I just said for the differentiated businesses as well as the floor care and specialty motors businesses, we expect overall sales growth of low to mid single-digits in 2014.","And finally then, if you look at AMETEK as a whole, combining the two segments, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we now expect low double-digit sales growth overall with organic growth up low to mid-single digits and obviously in the second half of the year we are expecting a good organic growth.","We had a really fine July on order intake which I think just continues this trend and we are seeing the global autonomy just generally improve, it\u2019s not a dramatic change, but, it sure feels better now than it did six months ago, let\u2019s say. So, Scott, that was a lot, I hope that gives answer to your question.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Well, it totally does, Frank. Thank you. The answers on that one is always much larger than the question. And I think all of us thank you for always doing that for us. If I could just ask one follow-up just on the M&A very quickly?","Frank Hermance","Sure.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","I think you \u2013 something you expressed a quarter or so ago was the desire to really kind of build out your power business and we really haven\u2019t seen other than Powervar the acquisitions there in 2014. How does the pipeline look for that area that I think you are still far getting?","Frank Hermance","No, it looks very good and just to add on, in addition to Powervar, which we did at the end of last year, in the first quarter we acquired Teseq and that\u2019s a power business. So, I am pretty pleased now if you take that whole power business, it has grown to about a $0.5 billion and it also has some diversification within it.","There is a roughly $220 million is in power, test and measurement equipment. There is another $200 million that is in battery back-up systems, that\u2019s where Powervar went and there is about $80 million that\u2019s in instrumentation that\u2019s used in generation, transmission and distribution applications. So, for a while, we were not growing the power business.","We\u2019ve now done to \u2013 we are out of $0.5 billion and that team has there on a $1 billion and that\u2019s the way we are thinking about it. And in terms of the pipeline, yes, there are deals that we are actively looking at in power. So, this is a good to buy because the market is just turning up and hopefully we can close some deals in this space and start to get towards that $1 billion level.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Frank, you again, thank you.","","Frank Hermance","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Douglas with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research","","Hi, good morning gentlemen.","Frank Hermance","Good morning.","Robert Mandos","","Hi, Mark.","Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research","Bob, the payables?","Robert Mandos","$383 million.","Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research","$383 million. Thank you. Frank, can you discuss the organic growth by region, maybe expand on the strong growth in Asia, but it sounds like a lot of that is you are just outgrowing the markets there with a lot of new initiatives in sales and marketing I would assume maybe some new products too. But could you just walk through what happened in the different areas?","Frank Hermance","Sure, I am glad to do that. Let\u2019s look organically, organically, in the US, we were up low single-digits and similarly in Europe, we were up low single-digits and as you stated in your question, a significant part of our growth came out of Asia where that growth was up in the mid-teens organically.","If you look at the BRIC countries, just another cut, the BRIC countries were up 21% overall and about 13% organically. China, just is superb. China was up organically, almost 25% and total I think it was a number like 35%. You got that with that am I right? 35%.","Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research","Yes.","","Frank Hermance","So, all the efforts and you\u2019ve heard me talking about the expansion in the BRIC countries, the expansion in Asia, they are really coming to fruition now and it\u2019s just an exciting time and even though, many of our peer companies are talking about issues in China and issues in Asia.","We are simply outgrowing the market from both a product point of view and also we got very strong distribution capability there now. In Asia, we have approximately 300 people who are engaged in selling our products and that doesn\u2019t include people in some cases were using distributors were not direct sales.","So it doesn\u2019t include the number of sales people that will be on the street in essence thought those distributors. These are about 300 people that are our AMETEK employees and it\u2019s just paying off in super dividends.","And you look at the lower organic growth in Europe and the US, we actually had a pretty difficult comparison that those numbers would probably be up closer to the mid single-digit area if you took out some of the large shipments that were done last year.","So, just in general, Mark, we are feeling better, we are feeling better. I can tell you that it\u2019s easier than it was six months ago to put up the results that we are putting up and that\u2019s because these economies are starting to move in a direction that\u2019s helping. So, it\u2019s a tailwind instead of a headwind.","And then you couple that with all of the operational things that we are doing and that\u2019s what has given us these really superb results.","Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research","Well, thanks for that. And then looking at your process business, can you discuss what\u2019s happening in process, in particular what you are seeing in oil and gas?","Frank Hermance","Yes, it\u2019s a great question Mark and as you are aware, over the last few years, oil and gas has been the driver to process and what is happening now which actually I view quite favorably is that there is balance now across all of those process businesses. So, in essence, we saw very strong growth in the non-oil and gas business.","But oil and gas results are also good. It just wasn\u2019t at the level that it was in terms of growth a year or two ago. So we are feeling pretty good about the process businesses, because, we\u2019ve got that broad-based strength. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about the ultra precision technology business.","That is doing even exclusive of the acquisitions is doing extremely well organically. Our med division had a really good quarter which is in the process area and also our measurement calibration technology division was fine. So, there is a broader base now and we are not as dependent just on oil and gas.","Although just to expand a bit. We see true opportunities in the fracking area. There is a lot going on in fracking. We think it\u2019s going to expand in China and other places outside the US. So there are definite opportunities for us to continue to grow in oil and gas even as the market dynamics come down a bit from where they were a year or two ago.","Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, thank you.","Frank Hermance","Sure, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Thanks. Good morning.","Frank Hermance","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","So what\u2019s been asked, but just going back to the Asia mid-teens organic, obviously it sounds like a lot of internal execution there. But just wondered if you could kind of add some commentary on to the extent that you are you\u2019ve really just lifted these to higher run rates versus now you have tough comps for next year with Asia?","Frank Hermance","Well, no, we think that \u2013 Chris, that we are going to continue to grow. So sure, we have improved our penetration in Asia. But we don\u2019t consider it that it\u2019s a new plateau that is going to be flat. We are going to continue to put investments in that region. We are putting in the BRIC countries which is a little bit broader obviously than just Asia.","We are putting in about 50 people this year. We are adding additional manufacturing capability in Asia and that is key to access to the markets there as you have products that are locally built. So we are just going to continue to add to those regions and if you take China for instance, even though the GDP in China has come down from the 9% to 10% region to the 7%, 7.5% region.","That GDP is still heck of a lot better than the US and Europe. So, we are going to continue to put investments in those regions and if you look at what has transpired in the company and just step back, the area that we were underpenetrated in was Asia.","And if you look at the mix now of that 56% that is outside the United States, the mix has gone, it\u2019s about 30% in Europe, it\u2019s now 20% in Asia and I can remember that number when it was 10%. So, it\u2019s now 20% and then you got 5% or 6% in sort of the other areas of the world.","So, we are getting a better balance, but we are still not there. It\u2019s still the part of the world, where I don\u2019t feel we have our fair share. And we are just going to continue to go after it and hopefully, although the comps will be a little bit more difficult next year. We are going to be able to show you increased performance over the levels of this year.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks. Very helpful.","Frank Hermance","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey good morning guys. It\u2019s Drew on for Nigel.","Frank Hermance","Hi Drew.","Unidentified Analyst","Frank, just a question on M&A going \u2013 or M&A accretion going forward. I\u2019m not sure how quantitative you can be here but maybe just qualitative given how much \u2013 how much synergy do you expect from the Zygo acquisition and then the other acquisitions to-date? Just what you are thinking about as far as accretion into 2015?","Frank Hermance","Yes, I haven\u2019t actually quantified what that is going to be in 2015. It\u2019s not significant in 2014. We will pick up a few pennies in 2014, but obviously as we start to put our synergies in place, and as I mentioned before, we are working through that. On Zygo, we will be able to quantify that, but I really don\u2019t have a number right now for that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Frank Hermance","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rob Mason \u2013 Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Mason \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Yes good morning.","Frank Hermance","Hi, Robert.","Robert Mason \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Frank, I wanted to know, if you could give us a feel for what pricing may have contributed to the 4% core growth in the quarter? And maybe how that compares to what you were getting earlier in the year?","Frank Hermance","Yes, it\u2019s about the same and it was 1.5% in the second quarter, another measure of that, sometimes we talk about is pricing minus inflation, where inflation is essentially everything in the business. Salaries, materials, et cetera, et cetera and that number of pricing minus inflation was about 0.6%. So we focus on that.","So that we do in fact, get some of the pricing to the bottom-line. So, that\u2019s the best quantification I can give you and these are also not what I would call exact numbers, they are not the easiest thing to establish. But we have a practice in place that we are very consistent and so the numbers are comparable, but they are not what I would call a GAAP precise.","Robert Mason \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Sure, that\u2019s helpful. And perhaps I missed it when you gave the run down on the aerospace business, but how did the military portion do in the quarter and the outlook there for the balance of the year? And if you have any insight in 2015 on military, that would be helpful?","Frank Hermance","It\u2019s a great question and that was probably and has been for the first half of the year and for our forecast for the rest of the year, surprisingly good. It\u2019s basically been in the low single-digit arena. And we are just not seeing a really major impact of sequestration in the US, US is down some, but it\u2019s being compensated by our international military business which is about half of the overall military business.","So, we actually thought it was going to be worst than what it is and I would say the outlook with everything I know in 2015 is going to be very similar. It\u2019s not going to be a high growth segment, but it\u2019s not going to be a major drain on the growth of the company.","Robert Mason \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And lastly, we spent a fair amount of time today, just discussing your ultra precision portfolio. Do you have a ballpark number on the size of the market that you are now addressing there? And give us a feel for what your share is?","Frank Hermance","Yes, I think if you think about all of those businesses in UPT and you think about probably a 35% market share, and I am going to use rough numbers here, so, this is a $500 million business in very rough numbers. So, you are talking about $1.5 billion kind of market opportunity, but as you know, this business, like most AMETEK businesses is very niche-oriented.","So, you can define the market in ways that either make it a very small market share or a very high market share. What I\u2019ve given you is sort of an average of the way we think about it. But probably more importantly, it\u2019s not only the share in that addressable market but as I said before, we have this internal process that we actually look at adjacencies around that.","So we feel, we can continue to grow into other market segments. So, I mean, a great example of this, I\u2019ll switch to a different part of the company, but when you look at the genesis of our power business, that actually came out of our aerospace business.","We decided to take land gas turbines or excuse me \u2013 take aircraft engines and simply convert them to land gas turbines and that\u2019s what got us started in the power business and now we have a $0.5 billion business.","So, you can sort of expand your market by taking technologies and putting them in other market areas or just doing \u2013 take in existing products and putting them in new markets. So there is, many different ways you can do this, but I think, that one-third or 33% market share is the most best way I can answer your question.","Robert Mason \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks, Frank.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Graham from Jefferies, please proceed with your question.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Hi, I didn\u2019t want to take up too much air time before, if you don\u2019t mind just answering one more question from me, Frank.","Frank Hermance","Sure Scott.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","The strength in the July orders, could you give us some little bit of color on that was it broad, was it a couple of businesses in particular and any type of number around that? Was that, you mean, that it was up more than the third quarter, whatever you can give us?","Frank Hermance","I didn\u2019t catch the last part of your question, Scott. What was that?","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","What was \u2013 when you say it was strong, did you mean to say that that\u2019s because it was up more than in the third quarter or if you can give us a number or attach a number to it, that would even be better, but whatever you can do.","Frank Hermance","Okay, well, the trend is positive. It\u2019s moving in an upward direction. The growth in orders was across the businesses it was not that we had one or two businesses that blew it out, it was \u2013 and I think that reflects the improvement in the overall global environment and when we look at July, it continued that trend.","I really was focused on July. I wanted to see, how strong the orders came in and it was very good. So now, we\u2019ll have to look at what occurs obviously in August which \u2013 this tend to be a little bit slower month and then hopefully, very, very good in September. But, I can\u2019t really quantify it for you except to say it was broad-based. It was strong and I think it reflects the global environment from an organic viewpoint.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks very much.","Frank Hermance","You bet, Scott.","Operator","Thank you.

We'll begin with some prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions.","I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. AMETEK delivered a second quarter results that were in line with our expectations, reflecting the strong efforts of our businesses in managing in a challenging global environment. Also, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired two businesses, Nu Instruments, a leading provider of magnetic sector mass spectrometers and HS Foils, a provider of radiation detector components. Both are excellent strategic fits with existing AMETEK businesses. I'll talk further about these acquisitions in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter.","Sales were in line with expectations in the second quarter at $977.7 million, down 3%, organic sales were down 7%, while acquisitions added 4%. The impact from currency in the quarter was negligible. Operating income was $219 million and operating income margin was 22.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.59, down 8% over last year's second quarter and at the high end of our guidance range.","Operating cash flow was very solid in the second quarter at $189 million, up 16% from the last year's second quarter, free cash flow conversions and net income was a strong 126%.","Now, turning to the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales of $596 million were in line with last year's second quarter, organic sales were down 6%, acquisitions contributed 6% and foreign currency was flat.","The contributions from recent acquisitions of Brookfield and ESP\/SurgeX were offset in large part by the weakness across our oil and gas business. As noted, we continue to face challenging conditions across our oil and gas business. Despite the modest rebound in the price of oil from it's February lows, customers remain cautious. They continued to defer maintenance work, and capital projects are being delayed. However, it appears as if conditions are stabilizing at lower levels than we previously anticipated. EIG's operating income in the second quarter was a $152.1 million, and operating margins were a strong 25.5%.","The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $381.7 million, down 6% versus the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 8%, acquisitions contributed 2% and foreign currency was flat.","EMG sales remained pressured by weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses, driven largely by the continued headwinds from our Specialty Metals business. This business has stabilized. However, we do not anticipate improvements in the second half as we previously expected. EMG's operating income was $80.3 million in the quarter and operating margins were a solid 21%.","Now let me provide background on the two acquisitions we announced this morning. First, Nu Instruments. Nu Instruments manufactures magnetic sector mass spectrometer used for elemental and isotopic analysis. Nu's mass spectrometers utilize a magnetic field to separate the isotopes of elements in order to analyze the material characterization of the sample. Their products are used in advanced laboratory analysis within earth and environmental sciences, material characterization and nuclear applications. Nu is an excellent strategic fit with our CAMECA advanced elemental analysis business. Nu's strong R&D capabilities and highly complementary product offerings will allow us to expand our presence in existing markets, we're opening up opportunities to expand to new attractive market segments. In addition, Nu will be able to leverage to meet the strong global sales and service channels to help accelerate growth.Nu Instruments is headquartered in Wrexham in the UK with additional offices in Beijing and Tokyo. It has annual sales of approximately $25 million.","The second acquisition is HS Foils. HS Foils develops and produces the key components used in radiation detectors. Each components include ultrathin radiation windows, silicon drift detectors and x-ray filters. HS Foils was an excellent technology acquisition for AMETEK. It provides us with unique patented intellectual property around silicon nitride window technology as well as extensive knowledges in silicon PIN and silicon drift detector manufacturing. HS Foils' technology will enable world class instrument performance across many of our Materials Analysis businesses, including Amptek, EDAX, SPECTRO and CAMECA.","In addition, HS Foils operates out of the state of the art semiconductor lab in Helsinki, Finland, which will help accelerate new product development initiatives. With these two acquisitions we've now deployed approximately $360 million in capital and acquired over $150 million in revenue on four acquisitions, so far in 2016. Our business unit and corporate teams remain active in identifying and pursing acquisition opportunities and we remain encouraged with the acquisition pipeline. The highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.","Let me transition from highlighting our recent acquisitions to highlighting an acquisition we completed in 2013. Creaform, which we acquired in October 2013, is a leading provider of 3D measurement technologies and services. They are the industry leader in standalone portable 3D scanners. Creaform's optically-based devices are used across a number of high growth applications within the aerospace, automotive and general industrial markets. Key applications for their products include reverse engineering, dimensional inspection, precision manufacturing, automated quality control and 3D printing.","Creaform has been a tremendously successful acquisition for AMETEK, with impressive results across all key financial and operational metrics. They have leveraged AMETEK's growth strategies, to help deliver outstanding results. Here are just a few of the highlights of their success. Organic sales have grown at double-digit rates since acquisition, operating margins have more than doubled, working capital as a percentage of sales has improved over 700 basis points to its current level of approximately 13% of sales. And sales from new products have increased from just over 40%, to now nearly 65%.","This new product capability has been an important driver of Creaform's success. They have introduced a number of innovative new products, which help them penetrate new markets, and capture additional share in their existing markets. Most recently, Creaform's new lineup of quality control solutions were awarded the prestigious Red Dot: Best of the Best Award for their quality and breakthrough designs. For over 60 year, Red Dot has been one of the largest and most influential independent product competitions in the world. So, this is a great honor. Specifically, Creaform's products were recognized for their unmatched accuracy and reliability of the 3D measurements in harsh and unstable production environments. The new Creaform products recognized were the HandyPROBE Next, the MetraSCAN 3D and the C-Track.","Within global end-market expansion, the Creaform team has done an outstanding job actively expanding and growing their strong market presence, and quality control, and reverse engineered into new markets such as non-destructive testing and healthcare.","Creaform has also expanded their aftermarket calibration and repair capabilities globally to help further improve their value to the customer, to also leveraging AMETEK's global footprint to expand their direct sales activities in the US, Brazil, and Southeast Asia. I would like to congratulate the Creaform team for their tremendous efforts and outstanding success. They have created a truly dynamic business for the execution of our growth strategies.","Now, let me take a moment to comment on current market conditions and their impact on our outlook for 2016. We fully understand and acknowledge the headwinds we face in this environment, given our mix of end-market exposures. These headwinds, especially within the oil and gas, and metals market have been deeper and more sustained than we initially expected when we started the year.","Visibility has remained limited as customers are cautious and are aggressively managing their inventory levels and capital spending plans. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we believe the business has stabilized. We do not anticipate a modest second half improvement as we had expected, but rather believe demand in the second half to be largely consistent with the first half. As a result, we now forecast 2016 revenue to be down low single-digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic sales down mid-single digits. We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.32 per diluted share, down 9% to 11% from 2015's adjusted diluted earnings per share. Third quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down mid-single digits versus the third quarter of 2015. And we estimate our earnings to be $0.54 to $0.55 per diluted share.","In summary, we remain focused on executing our four growth strategies despite economic uncertainty in many of our markets. We'll continue to aggressively manage our business in the short-term, while assuring we continue to make appropriate investments in our businesses to properly position us for 2017 and beyond.","While we have short-term market headwinds, I am very bullish on the opportunity for AMETEK to drive meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns moving forward. Our balance sheet remains strong. We generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our businesses are highly differentiated with strong market positions and excellent profitability. We have right-sized the cost structure and we'll realize meaningful incremental margins as the current market headwinds subside.","Bill Burke will now cover some of the financial details, and then we will be glad to take your question. Bill?","William J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, our businesses performed well in the quarter, meeting our earnings expectations and generating strong cash flows despite that difficult end-market conditions. I'll provide some of the financial highlights.","In the quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the recent acquisitions. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.5% down slightly from last year's second quarter rate of 27.7%. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to be between 26% and 27% as a result of the success of our ongoing tax planning initiatives.","As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital defined as receivables plus inventories less payables was 19.8% of sales in the second quarter, down from 20.8% in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million in the quarter and full year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be $70 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $41 million for the quarter, and we expect full year depreciation and amortization to be $165 million. Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $189 million, up 16% over the last year's second quarter. Free cash flow was also strong at $175 million in the quarter, up 15% over last year's second quarter.","And as a percent of net income free cash flow was a 126% for the second quarter and we expect the full year free cash flow to be 125% of net income. Total debt was $2.14 billion at June 30, up approximately $200 million from the 2015 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $456 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at June 30 of 33.4%.","At June 30, we had approximately $1 billion of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. We remain active on deploying our strong free cash flow with our highest priority for capital deployment being acquisitions. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we closed two acquisitions, HS Foils and Nu Instruments bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2016 to approximately $360 million.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 417,000 shares of stock for $19 million and as well in the first several days of July, we repurchased just under 1 million shares of stock for approximately $45 million.","In summary, we had a solid second quarter. We're well-positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and cash flows. Kevin?","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay, great. Thanks, Bill. Hey, Brandi, we are now happy to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Yeah. So, I guess obviously tough end market conditions. But if I compare \u2013 the last time we had big end market declines back in 2009 to today, you held the line on margins much better then. I'm just wondering maybe, David, if you could just maybe compare and contrast 2009 to here, what led you to keep margins pretty flat to slightly up during that period. And obviously we're seeing a bit more pressure today.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. That's a great question, Nigel. You'll recall, 2009 was much different than it is in the current environment. All of the markets were down and we took action to deal with all the markets then it returned very quickly. But in the current environment, a couple of our markets are down, but some of our markets are hanging in there fine. So, the difference really is, it's a much slower market and the market has drug on for some time. And we have a much higher margin company right now. Remember that we were a mid-teens operating income margin company. Now we're much higher.","And the two markets that are down, about 20% of our company, oil and gas and metals are down 30%. So, that's a difficult tailwind to offset, but we've done a good job to do it. We still have 22.4% operating margins and we had a good operating quarter.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. No, I understand that. And then, just maybe a related question, just thinking about your exports from the US. You've got a relatively high U.S. export exposure and I'm wondering the impact of the stronger US dollar particularly on your Process business what impact that's having on pricing within Process and maybe on top of that, any hedge impacts on margins would be helpful.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. Yeah. The question of price, across our whole business, we were up about 1 point and we had total inflation of a little less than that. So, it was still a positive contribution. We are seeing additional headwinds as you talked about, so, we call that flat for the year, meaning price will offset inflation. So, it's a different environment and our Process businesses, they were very successful in expanding in the emerging markets. Also, very successful in the oil and gas market. So, that is one point that we're seeing issues.","Certainly, with a strong US dollar when we're manufacturing in the US, we see competitive pressure because of the strong dollar. There is no doubt about that. We are dealing with that by relocating to low cost locations and in most situations, we don't have competitors in different market segments that give us an advantage.","But in terms of the translation and transaction effects, now we are in a relatively stable environment. We're not seeing much effect and you know we're naturally hedged in most of our markets. So, I hope those answers your questions.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Is the pricing flat? Or price cost plus the...","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, pricing is up a point across the business. And price, less total inflation, that's all costs in the business, is still slightly positive for the quarter. But our outlook for the year is calling price, less total inflation to be flat.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone. How are you doing today?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Rob.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. A couple of questions. One, I think I it was customary in the past that Frank would kind of go through the state of some of the sub-segments in terms of what we're seeing, in terms of growth and just a little bit of more color. If you could do that kind of State of the Union for AMETEK, right now, that would be helpful?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Rob. I'll start with EIG aerospace. EIG aerospace sales were flat as compared to the last year, as we saw continued strong growth across the commercial business that was offset by weakness in the business and regional jet market. For all 2016, we expect a similar trend to continue as the second quarter, with the commercial market being strong and offsetting weaker business than regional jets.","This business continues to deliver strong new programs wins. These wins are across a wide range of platforms, including commercial OEM, business and regional jets, military. And year-to-date they have already won $230 million in life of program wins. So we're really excited about the new business we're winning in that market. And you know that's important for the future of any aerospace business.","Next sub-segment where we process. Organic sales in process were down mid-single digits in the quarter, driven largely by weakness across our oil and gas business. Our Ultra Precision Technology business performed very well in the quarter. That team has done an excellent job managing the business. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for our Process business to be down to mid-to-high-single digits driven by the weakness in oil and gas.","Going to the EIG, Power & Industrial sub-segment, we have overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up double digits driven by the contributions of recent acquisitions of ESP\/SurgeX and Brookfield, organic sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down mid-single digits versus 2015, which Is unchanged from our prior forecast. So when you step back, in 2016 for all EIG, we expect overall sales to be down low-single digits, with organic sales down mid-single digits.","And if we switch to EMG, first the differentiated parts of our EMG business, organic sales were down mid-single digits, driven largely by continued weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. We did see sequential stabilization in this business. However, the second half improvements that we had anticipated are going to be delayed and delayed out of 2016.","As a result, we expect second half sales across our EMIP businesses to be largely flat with the first half. And for all of our differentiated EMG business we now expect organic sales to be down mid-single digits versus the prior year.","And finally, our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business. Although a small part of the AMETEK, organic sales on our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were down low-teens in the second quarter as a result of softer demand across our key markets. And for all of 2016 we expect this business to be down mid-single digits organically as comparisons ease to the back half of the year.","So, if you look at only EMG, we expect the overall sales to be down low-single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","And all AMETEK...","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","... we expect overall sales to be down low-single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits on a percentage business. Hope that helps.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, it does. Thanks for that run through. I guess, the next question obviously is kind of cadence of M&A, size of M&A. I mean, obviously you have deployed a fair amount of capital here. You are in an environment where \u2013 I hate to typify it \u2013 but you have eroding fundamentals of the margin yet, very high equity valuations which would imply high valuations for deals in both the public and private markets.","So, the bid ask is really kind of nettlesome at this point. I mean, do you think, this causes a challenge to transacting deals or deals of size? And how do you think about public deals because I think that was an area of potential opportunity for you?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right, you have a lot of questions there. I'll try to unpack them. I think, the first point is we have four deals done this year, and we deployed $360 million in free cash flow. And we're about half way through the year, so we're pretty much online for what we're doing. So, we agree that the environment is tough, but we're still getting it done.","The second point is, we're bullish on our pipeline. We talked about expanding our pipeline past a couple of quarters, and we're starting to benefit from the efforts of the pipeline identification efforts. And as you mentioned and recall, our sweet spot is that $50 million to $200 million deal. But we've expanded our horizons now, we're looking for deals up to $500 million in revenue, and we're looking at both private and public companies and we're really optimistic, because our pipeline is starting to reflect the efforts of the last couple of quarters as those businesses are working their way through the pipeline.","So, in terms of the acquisitions, it is a tougher environment, we're getting deals done. We have a solid pipeline, we end up parsing those deals and selecting the deals to do that we can add the most value to and we're still very selective. And it is a key driver of our future value enhancement, so I'm really optimistic, we have plenty of fire power, $1 billion of capacity within our existing credit lines and cash on hand. More importantly, our operating cash flow is $750 million, free cash flow of about $670 million and I think this can be a significant driver for the balance of 2016 and 2017 performance.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Last question if you indulge me. In terms of the guidance for the full-year, you have visibility in kind of your end markets to the back half and some of the inventory challenges you've had in the stabilization. But, suffice it to say, you feel good about this guidance, is it conservative, is it unlikely we'll get another cut in the back half?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No. There is not going to be another cut in the back half. We feel the business has stabilized, key markets, headwinds have stabilized, and our second half looks very much like our first half.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'll leave it there. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Great.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning. And welcome to chair your first call, Dave.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Bill, as well Kevin. Unfortunately, it comes under not terrific auspices, but I certainly did like the answer to, or how you finished Rob's question just now. I guess maybe more surgically, I was wondering if you could tell us what were the pressure points on the second half effective guidance reduction here? What changed? You seem to have pretty good line of sight, you gave us some really good numbers in the first quarter as to why the guidance needed to come down. Could you maybe do something similar to that for the second half to perhaps make us feel as good as you feel about the full-year guidance at this point?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So there is kind of two questions there. One, really what's driving the takedown and why do we feel good about the stabilization. So I'll take the first point. Really, if you look at it, it can be explained really easily economically. Our organic growth is dropping 2.5 points versus the prior forecast or approximately $100 million. And it's really driven by oil and gas, and metals. That results in a 50% decremental. Oil and gas is one of our most profitable businesses.","So if you take that $50 million and you look at the number of shares we have, it turns out to $0.16. So that puts you right in the mid-point of the guidance range. So that's what happens economically. When we look out for the balance of the year, really our EMIP business we thought that was going to pick up and now it's not. And we can talk about that a little more in a bit, but fundamentally we got comfortable with it because it's flat. We saw the same demand patterns in Q1 as we saw Q2 and we're forecasting that for the rest of the year.","In terms of our oil and gas business, it dropped lower than we initially anticipated and we had modest improvements in that business and now we're forecasting it flat. And when we look at that business, we really think it's bottomed, based on what our customers are telling us, based on some of the commentary that you have heard from Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger where rig counts bottomed in Q2. So that business is down, but we think it's bottomed.","To your point, how do we get comfortable with the stability in the year, I'll talk a little about the first half being the second half, being similar, and really embedded within our guidance is really our Q4 is really a carbon copy of what we just did in Q2.","So we're not really forecasting a major uptick in the second half. In fact Q3 is down a bit seasonally because of some typical slowness that we've seen in Europe in the summer and we've normal seasonality in Q4, but really Q4 is very similar to Q2. And to your broader point about the forecast and then how we're accurate, why we feel more confident, many of you've followed AMETEK for quite a while and in the past our forecasting process has yielded very consistent results and it hasn't the last few quarters. And it's a difficult environment where we have visibility is weak from our customers and demand is weak in many of our markets, customers are delaying capital projects, customers are managing inventory aggressively, the emerging markets are challenged.","But all that said, we have to do a better job forecasting our environment. And I asked Bill, and the Group Presidents to take a look at our forecasting process with a focus on making it more robust given the environment. So we took a different approach to forecasting, we got our entire executive office involved, we took a deep analytical review of each business to understand their forecast and to better assess potential risk.","We had conversations with the financial community, so we understood what was happening. And although it was a more time-consuming process, we felt it was the right thing to do at this point. It allowed our executive office, which has a broader field of view than those of our P&L leaders running our niche businesses, who by definition are only going to see a more narrower view of the global economy. We took that broader view, we applied a consensus view of risk, it's reflected in our guidance and the final point, this is a rigorous process and I feel confident in the results.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Dave, that was very helpful. I very much appreciate that. But obviously the thing is, is that we \u2013 with the exception of the new rigor and the new sort of construct you have around the guidance, we did hear that in the first quarter, oil prices are now lower again, I know it's a small business but truck is falling apart.","And then you have Brexit potentially affecting Europe. So if your reduction in guidance is only around oil and gas and metals, is there essentially a lift in the cost savings number to make sure you get there, that's kind of where I may be coming up short?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. Yeah, our cost reductions are $130 million for the year. So, it's the same number that we communicated last quarter and really on lower volume, we're purchasing less material, but we're confirming the $130 million number. So, the cost reduction is embedded in it. You mentioned Brexit, there is a situation where we are balanced in revenues and expenses. We have 5% of our sales in UK. We're balanced in revenues and expenses, so we have a natural hedge.","So we're not going to have any transaction or translation surprise, so we have, expect a short-term impact to be minimal. We've been checking with our UK businesses on a weekly basis. So we haven't seen any downturn in orders yet, mainly because we're in a market that's not maybe tied to the consumer there. And you're right, longer-term impact; it will be driven with the economic growth, on the European and the global growth.","And then, this uncertainty is going to go on for some time, but we're feeling pretty good about our exposure. And there are weak global macro conditions. I mean we highlighted oil and gas and metals, but certainly the global economy is not good, and you have the spillover effect from oil and gas into the other markets. So, all the markets are tough. Again, with the first half or the second half they're essentially carbon copies of each other and we are very comfortable with it.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. That's great, Dave. Thanks very much.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys, good morning.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Allison.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Dave, I just want to go back, you said, to sort of that metals commentary, I guess, high-level. I agree we would have thought that we would have seen improvement there, can you kind of walk us through what happened, what changed in that business that's driving sort of a lower expectation for the back half now?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right, sure. First, let me take a moment, in this business, we take metals, metals such as Titanium, Vanadium, Cobalt, Nickel, Molybdenum and process them with very unique processing capabilities into specialty alloys, powders, components and we are very \u2013 we have strong niche positions and we feel very good about this business.","What's happening is two things, visibility and inventory. In this business, we tend to be four to five levels removed from the ultimate end customer or application. So, as a result the visibility is limited and we can get misaligned with the broader end-market demand given the inventory buildup in the channel and we are seeing this play out right now.","To give you a tangible example, we produce specialized master alloys which is a critical component in that the making of titanium parts for aircraft, we're one of the few producers who can make the specialized alloy, but \u2013 we're far down removed on the food chain. So, we sell to a titanium melter, who sells to an ingot maker, who sales to a part manufacturer, who sells to a sub-assembly manufacturer, who eventually gets on the airframe. So, we are quite a way removed in this business, different than most of our businesses.","And we really, we identify some secondary inventory locations who have some inventory. So although the long-term demand for titanium master alloy, in this case an aircraft, is very strong with new aircraft using more titanium, the short-term demand for alloys has been impacted by this excess inventory in the supply chain.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is there any sense of when that excess inventory would be cleared?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's not going to clear in 2016, but we're still bullish that it's going to clear and it will be in 2017.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. That's helpful. And then on the new acquisition, you had talked about expanding it into the new market; can you expand on that, like where would that sort of a new market be for AMETEK?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Right. That's a great acquisition. We're talking about Nu Instruments and they are very analytical high-end magnetic sector mass spectrometers and the markets that we're in currently are similar to the markets that our CAMECA business is in, the research market and environmental, I mean in the environmental sciences, material characterization, nuclear. But the one new market that we're interested is, they have a new product that's in the food and beverage testing market.","And the interesting thing about it, in the news, there is a lot of questions about food contamination and the interesting thing about the new equipment is it is so sensitive, and has a unique processing capability, it can actually tell if there is a contamination, and it's sensitive enough to tell where in the world the food is from. So we're very optimistic for the food testing market, and that business, if you take a step back, the business had basically one sales person. And they have great technology and we're going to plug it into our CAMECA business with a tremendous sales and service network and really optimistic about the potential for Nu.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's great. Thanks so much.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, Dave. You referenced a bit of a 3Q step down clearly on the EPS. Is that all volume related and what exactly drives the step back in 3Q versus the kind of run rates for the year?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. Yeah. Its change from Q2 to Q3 can be explained by lower sales volume. So, our EPS is lower because of volume and typically we have a \u2013 Europe has some slower months and we have seasonality in Q3 that drops back a bit. And in Q4, there is really our normal seasonality. And as I said before, Q4 is really a carbon copy of the quarter, we just completed. So, we feel pretty good about it.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. It make sense. And then on the deals, I think you mentioned, a $150 million total sales acquired to-date, disclose Nu if I look at the first quarter deals. I think it all implies HS Foils is similar in size, do I have that right, to Nu.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think the numbers are wrong, it was a $115 million.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Oh, $115 million. Got it.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","So, what you really have with Nu \u2013 we've paid a price that was a little more than two times sales, close to two times sales. And the, it's nine times the first year EBITDA and HS Foils is smaller. It's significantly smaller. It's a technology acquisition, that's really going to help us drive organic growth and we're optimistic about it, but it's in the low millions of dollars in terms of the technology.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That clears it up. Thanks.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just a follow up on the specialty metals business. So, and I certainly understand that these end-markets are fundamentally pretty healthy, so is this a permanent change in how the supply chain is managing inventory, or are there any competitive shifts going on here that are notable? And just, any permanent change in the level of activity in the specialty metals business?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's not a permanent change, Matt. I mean, it's an issue where the metals market that I talked before, about the complex supply chain, it's kind of in between us and really good end-markets. And that market is in \u2013 it's into stress right now. So the customers are managing their inventories for cash, they're being very aggressive in terms of working capital, but long term, we're very bullish.","I mean, if you look at the titanium used in aircraft, if you look at \u2013 that's all growing with the A315 and 787, if you look at the other end-market applications in medical and specialized industrial, we're very bullish. I mean, certainly, we have a FX that's creating headwinds with that business along with some of our other business, but there really is no competitive dynamic that's major, and the market is going to return and we're going to have good businesses in good positions, and we just have to wait it out. And we \u2013 I talk a lot about the visibility and the inventory, but that's the key factor. It is not an issue where it's not going to come back.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. And so, following up on some of the stabilization comments you made. You gave great insight around your level of conviction to that comment for oil and gas, some customer comments and actions, how about outside oil and gas? Any other \u2013 do you have orders or backlog or any other comments to give you confidence about stabilization ...","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","... in the other parts of your business?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, our backlog is $1.1 billion. I mean, if we look at the run rates and we spend a lot of detail on it, it gives us confidence for the back half of the year. So again, we mentioned that the metals business is already performing from \u2013 and that's flat sequentially from Q1 to Q3. There's not much change in the other parts of our business. And there's not much change in the market. You really have a slow global macro environment and the two things we've been trying to get our hands around are really oil and gas, and metals, but the balance of the business is performing as we expected.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, good morning.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Richard.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Dave, or maybe this is a question for Bill, but could you just explain the decremental EBIT in EIG? And roughly flat core sales, we delivered something like $9 million less of profit. Is that all mix shift with oil and gas being weak?","William J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think in EIG, we had a negative 6% core. So what you're seeing is roughly, I think it's a 50% kind of decremental margin in that business. You've got some of the higher margin businesses going down, and that's really what's driving the decline quarter-over-quarter in terms of the profitability in the business.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Another point I would add to that, Richard is, really as you think about what happened last year, our mid and downstream oil and gas businesses were still running very strong. So, you have that business as very profitable and now it has started down. So, that's a \u2013 one of the...","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","...the profit impacts in Q2 year-over-year.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then I noticed from your comments, Dave, when you kind of laid out some of the sub segment expectations for sales, the cost driven motors business now is going to be down mid-single digits verus flat, but probably more to the point the EIG aerospace commentary suggests, the second half is flat and maybe the full year turns out to be flat versus \u2013 plus low single to plus mid-single. So has there been a down shift on the aerospace side in that regional bizjet market?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The regional bizjet market, if you recall in 2015 we talked about some wins and new product wins and some retrofit opportunities and this year really in that regional business jet were down about 18% and you have some of the wins we talked about, I'll threw a couple of examples out with HondaJet. Well, we were design into the HondaJet. We're making significant shipment commitments, but the HondaJet has been delayed. So there is \u2013 that market is down. We were over performing in 2015 when the market was flat and we're really at the market levels but dropping back. And I point to some programs that are not repeating or delayed.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I see.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","The commercial market is strong and there is really no change in that. We have \u2013 there we have \u2013 if you look historically we're mainly a Boeing airframe company and over the past 10 years we've diversified our market to be even between Boeing and Airbus. So we're kind of don't care who wins, we win with both and we got more content on newer aircrafts. So even though the airframes are relatively flat, we're so growing in commercial and we feel good about that right now.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And then just one, maybe a strategic question for you, Dave. As you kind of step in the role, and I know there is this kind of bullets flying all over the place here in terms of end-market conditions, but historically, AMETEK has targeted this framework where our core businesses and our core business prospects are kind of plus 5%, and then we're going to add 10% through M&A, but given where we are with the acquisitions over the last five years on the metals side, our oil and gas exposure was bigger than we had thought perhaps, but how do you feel about the next three years to five years, targeting a core growth rate for your current mix of businesses? I mean, should we think about that downshifting to more of a GDP number, and then we'll have fits and starts that maybe are plus or minus the GDP, is that a more realistic view, given the set of businesses, and the mix of business that you have kind of inherited and are now moving forward?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I see your point, it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in the first few years. And I did a lot of assessment of AMETEK's performance obviously, before I got into the role. And I'm a bit biased and look at our earnings growth through that \u2013 through the cycle of the last 10 years, we grew earnings 16% compounded annually. And I'd give our self a good grade for that, an A. Margins, same kind of thing, highest margins in the industrial space, cash flow generation has been outstanding, our return on capital well in excess of our cost of capital. And our capital deployment spend has been excellent. We're using our free cash flow to acquire good businesses and make them better. But in my role, dealing with your question, organic growth is important and certainly over the next few years when the environment can be slower, we can deal with flatter markets, and taken the current aftermarket headwinds aside with oil and gas, and metals, but separate from that, when we return to more flattish, stabilized markets, we need to adapt our strategy to the potential new reality in the marketplace.","And really, when I look at it to ensure that we're going to be able to double our earnings over the next five years by low to mid-single digit organic growth and adding on acquisitions of 5% to 10% a year, we need to do a better job of organic growth.","And in our organic growth, we've been average, we've been average compared against some good companies, but we can definitely improve. So we can do this under the construct of our existing growth strategies and expand our operational excellence toolkit and put more tools in that toolkit to focus on our sales and marketing processes. Really, making the front-end of our business as good as our operations. And that's going to be an area of focus for me and my team, and it's going to take some time, it's not going to be something that moves in the short term, but I'm confident they can get better.","So we're focused on making organic growth better. To your exact question, I think in a slow environment, we're going to have to boost it a little bit to get that low to mid-single digit organic growth that will allow us to double the earnings of the company.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. All right. Well, thank you.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Akshay Bhatia - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, and this is Akshay Bhatia on for Andrew. I just wanted to dig into your energy exposure a little bit, could you remind us what your exposure is between upstream, midstream and downstream after a couple of years of downturn, and maybe could you talk about some of the trends you saw over the course of the quarter, how April compared to June across these different business lines?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right, it was difficult to hear you, but I think I have your question. Yeah, the oil and gas business as we talked before was lower than forecasted in Q2, but stabilized. So we saw orders in that second quarter that really matched our Q3 volume level. So we feel good about that.","Coming into the year, it was about a $360 million business for AMETEK, about a third of that is upstream, a third of that is midstream and a third of that is downstream. The business is one-third in the US and two-thirds international. So we have a $120 million take down this year. So the $360 million is going to be down $120 million, that's about a third, and it's about $60 million down in upstream, and $60 million down the combination of midstream and downstream. So if you look at our upstream exposure, that's down about 60%, and our midstream and downstream exposure is about 20%.","Akshay Bhatia - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I know you talked about pricing overall being up 1% but maybe could you discuss pricing that you're seeing specifically in the energy market?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The pricing in the energy market is below the average for the whole company. It's a very difficult environment. They've had to reduce costs to stay in business. We still can maintain pricing because we have very premier positions with niche-differentiated technologies. But it's certainly not at the AMETEK level on average and it's down a bit in the energy market, more in the upstream than the midstream and downstream.","Akshay Bhatia - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Bhupender.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Just on the orders growth here. Could you give us the number and organically what the orders growth were for EIG and EMG in the quarter?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Organic orders were minus 7%, so that was in line with sales. And our EIG organic orders were down 5% and EMG organic orders were down 9%.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And we have been talking about products in the end-markets. I think, I just wanted to focus on the geographic mix here, if you can give us some color how the emerging markets did actually in the quarter, because oil and gas is like two-third is international, just wanted to get a sense of how it did in like a Europe, Asia Pacific and outside the US, too?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure, Bhupender. I'll go around the world. In the US, we were down high single-digits versus last year. There are broader industrial weakness, but the key factors driving the negative growth were oil and gas and metals. In Europe, it's been \u2013 it was down low-single-digit. So we've been at that level for several quarters. Oil and gas impacted the region, but we don't have much metals exposure in Europe.","And in Asia, we were down mid-single-digits and China was down mid-single-digits. So, there is a little bit of an improvement in China, there was a better trend for Asia where we were down double-digits for three quarters in a row and now we are down mid-single-digits and China was a negative for us. So, orders for the region, the entire Asia region were a little bit better than prior years. So, it seems to be that, that Asia is stabilizing, China is stabilizing and the one emerging market that I'd point out is doing better than the others is India, that's about the mid-single-digit growth, and it's a much smaller exposure but our investments there are paying off.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","And how should we think about how these markets would act or what kind of assumptions you have for the second half? Like which of these markets would be kind of remaining stable along the lines you just mentioned or they would deteriorate further?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. If I look at the trends in the US even though we're down high-single digits, it's slightly better from last quarter. Europe, that same trend is continuing and in Asia, we are improving a bit but really it's \u2013 we don't have anything factored in, it's really a down mid-single-digit. So, geographic-wise it's square with our concept of stabilization.","I mean fundamentally our business has stabilized and then \u2013 and we are working on our earnings growth for 2017 now. We're focused on our business. We are getting ready to go into our budgeting process and that budgeting process that we go through in Q3 and spreads into Q4, there is really no area immune from efficiency improvement. We are going to look at things like global sourcing, low-cost region production, value analysis, value engineering, plant consolidations, engineering, all of the tools that we have and we are going to get a healthy cost reduction target. And we're going to pair that with acquisitions and that's how we are going to grow our earnings next year. So the geography is not a big factor in thinking through what we have to do for the balance of the year or what we have to do next year.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And if I go back like a few quarters here when Frank was there, he did mention that AMETEK could actually grow their margins by 30 bps to 40 bps I believe, if I'm right even in a declining organic growth sales. Now, how should we think about the back half of this year, are we \u2013 any assumptions here, where the focus will be more on the cost side as the macro is kind of...","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right, right. For the year, we're saying operating income margins will be down a 130 basis points to 170 basis points. In the longer term \u2013 I mean given our high margin contribution margin businesses and given our operational excellence capabilities as far as the eye can see, when we get out of these market conditions and we return to internal growth we have the same 30 bps of margin expansion for the long-term.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay got it. And lastly, just wanted to tap into your oil and gas, you just gave a number of $360 million, is that company-wide, that's the direct exposure or ...","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. That's direct exposure, it's not indirect exposure, saw some impact in other markets that are not oil and gas related but that's a direct exposure and that will be done about a $120 million this year.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Right, that's what, I just want to get a sense of \u2013 because when we think of AMETEK we think of oil and gas to be about like let's say 9% of total sale, which is about like $360 million which we just gave.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","When we look at indirect exposure within EMRP and some other markets where oil and gas is definitely one of the markets where you're serving. I don't know if you've done some work internally to kind of give us a sense of what the indirect exposure would be.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No \u2013 yeah, the total market exposure for AMETEK, most of it's in process. But, the total market expansion for AMETEK, exposure \u2013 going into the year with $360 million, that's the entire exposure. I was talking about the indirect exposure. For example, when you look at the helicopter market, I mean they're using helicopters to fly to offshore platform. So there's less demand for helicopters and that's in our business jet, regional jet segment. That's what we report it. So when I was talking indirect, I was talking about the total oil and gas exposure is the $360 million.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","David A.

Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another excellent quarter. We delivered results that exceeded our expectations and continue to see very solid growth in both sales and orders. This growth is broad-based across our businesses. Our businesses are executing very well, which is evident in our strong operating performance and cash generation. This strong sales and operating performance is translating into excellent earnings results, with diluted earnings per share in the second quarter up 10% over the prior year. As a result, we have again raised our full year earnings guidance range.","Now, on to the financial and business highlights for the quarter. Sales in the second quarter were a record $1.06 billion, up 9% compared to the same quarter in 2016. Organic sales were up 4%, acquisitions added 6%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind in the quarter. We are very encouraged with the continued strong level of organic sales growth as it again exceeded our expectations. We also saw excellent growth in orders, with overall orders up 20% and organic orders up a very strong 12%. This order performance follows a strong order performance we saw in the first quarter and is driving a record level of backlog at over $1.3 billion.","Operating income in the quarter was $232.4 million, up 6% from the second quarter of 2016. Reported operating income margins were 21.8% in the quarter with core margins at 22.7%, up 30 basis points versus the prior year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.65, an increase of 10% compared to last year's second quarter of $0.59 per share. Our strong operating performance continues to translate into excellent cash flow generation. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was excellent, with free cash flow conversion at 123% of net income.","Now turning to the individual operating groups; first, the Electronic Instruments Group. In the quarter, EIG sales were a record $657.7 million, up 10% versus the second quarter of 2016. Organic sales were up 2%. The acquisitions of Rauland, Nu Instruments, and HS Foils contributed 9% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. EIG's operating income for the second quarter was very strong at $165.2 million, up 9% versus the same period in 2016, with operating income margins an excellent 25.1%.","The Electromechanical Group had another great quarter with robust sales and orders growth. Overall sales were up 7% versus the second quarter of 2016. Organic sales were also up 7%, with 1% acquisition growth, offset by a 1% foreign currency headwind. EMG's second quarter operating income was $85.6 million, up 7% over the prior year, with operating income margins a very strong 21%. Overall, our results for the quarter were outstanding. AMETEK is performing very well and we are poised for a strong second half of the year.","Before I discuss our updated outlook for the year, let me touch on developments and our four growth strategies. First, acquisitions. We are very pleased with our efforts on the acquisition front. We completed the acquisition of MOCON on June 22, following shareholder and regulatory approvals. MOCON is the leading provider of laboratory and field gas analysis instrumentation to research labs, production facilities and QC departments, in food and beverage, pharmaceutical and industrial applications. We are very excited about this acquisition, and I would like to welcome the MOCON team to AMETEK.","With the acquisitions of MOCON and Rauland, two very high-quality businesses, AMETEK has deployed approximately $520 million in capital thus far in 2017. Our M&A and business development teams remain very active in developing our acquisition pipeline. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deploy our free cash flow on value-enhancing acquisitions. And as we've proven, AMETEK has a robust acquisition process in place to integrate and improve acquired businesses.","Next, new product development. We continue to design and develop new products and solutions to solve our customers' most complex and challenging problems. We have outstanding engineering talent, combined with excellent new product development capability. Our vitality index, which measures the portion of total sales coming from new products, was excellent at 25% of sales in the second quarter. This level of vitality speaks to the quality and success of our new product development efforts.","I wanted to highlight one example of a new product introduced in the second quarter, the Creaform MaxSHOT Next. The MaxSHOT Next is a new optical coordinate measuring system designed for large-scale metrology projects mainly in the aerospace, automotive and transportation industries. With this new product, Creaform has achieved a major industry milestone by developing an intelligent measurement solution that autonomously guides users to the right measurements with 40% more accuracy and unparalleled ease of use. This product received the prestigious Red Dot Design Award for Design Excellence in 2017.","Creaform is an excellent example of a business that has generated significant organic growth and excellent market expansion through the development of new products and solutions around this core 3D metrology. Across all of our businesses in 2017, we expect to increase our investment in R&DE to approximately $220 million, which is roughly 5% of our sales. This is an increase of approximately 10% over 2016.","We also continue to expand in new markets around the world. International sales in the second quarter made up 51% of our total sales with very strong organic growth in China, India, the Middle East and other parts of Southeast Asia, due to the investments we have made to expand our presence in these regions.","In addition to these incremental investments, we have also expanded our operational excellence capabilities with new tools started improving our sales, marketing and channel management processes. One of the new tools are Growth Kaizens. Growth Kaizens are specific, continuous improvement projects targeted at expanding our market share in an attractive growth market or geography where a business unit may be underpenetrated. About one year into our rollout, we are very pleased with the success we are seeing and expect expansion of this growth Kaizen process across more of our businesses will drive continued incremental growth opportunities.","We're also pleased with our efforts to improve overall efficiency and drive operational savings. For all of 2017, we continue to expect approximately $100 million in total operational excellence savings. In addition to this level of savings, our teams continue to drive meaningful improvements in working capital, thus driving improved operating performance and cash flow generation. Bill will provide more specific details on our working capital performance, but I wanted to commend our teams for their great work in this area.","Now, let me switch to the updated outlook for the year. For all of 2017, we now expect overall sales to increase high-single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2016. Organic sales are now expected to be up low- to mid-single digits. We have increased our earnings guidance range for 2017 to $2.46 to $2.52 per diluted share, up 7% to 10% over 2016 adjusted earnings.","This is an increase from our prior guidance range of $2.40 to $2.48. For the third quarter of 2017, we are expecting overall sales to be up approximately 10% with organic sales up low-single digits. We anticipate diluted earnings per share for the third quarter will be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62, up 7% to 11% compared to the third quarter of 2016.","To summarize, the second quarter results were outstanding with high-quality earnings growth driven by sales and superb operating performance. The exceptional work that our world-class teams have put in to the first half of the year has positioned the company for a very strong earnings growth in 2017. Through our four growth strategies, we are focused on maximizing the company's potential in our improving markets, and investing in the future to provide both short- and long-term success.","I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter and the year. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. As Dave mentioned, our businesses performed very well in the second quarter, delivering excellent cash flow and operating results that exceeded our expectations. I'll provide some financial highlights. In the second quarter, core selling expenses were up less than core sales growth. Our second quarter general and administrative expenses were up $5 million over the second quarter of 2016, due largely to higher compensation expense, including costs associated with the retirement of our Executive Chairman.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 26%, down from the second quarter of 2016 rate of 27.5% due to ongoing tax planning initiatives and the benefit from stock-based compensation. For 2017, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 27%. Please keep in mind that actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate.","Working capital, defined as receivables, plus inventory, less payables, was an excellent 17.9% of sales in the quarter, down from 19.8% in last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million for the quarter and $28 million for the year to date. For the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be between $75 million and $80 million.","Second quarter depreciation and amortization was $44 million and we expect full year 2017 depreciation and amortization to be approximately $180 million. We continue to generate very strong cash flow.","In the quarter, operating cash flow was $199 million, up 5% from the second quarter of 2016. Free cash flow was $185 million or 123% of net income. For the full year, excluding the $50 million pension contribution we made in the first quarter, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 125% of net income. We've been very active in deploying our free cash flow this year. In the second quarter, we deployed approximately $184 million on the acquisition of MOCON that brings our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2017 to approximately $520 million.","Total debt at June 30 was $2.4 billion, up from $2.34 billion at the end of 2016. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of approximately $515 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at June 30 of 34%. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.","To summarize, the performance from our businesses was outstanding and provided a high-quality of earnings. We remained well-positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Bill. Andrew, we're now ready to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global. Your line is now open.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Thanks. A couple of questions. First, can you talk about the EIG business for a moment and maybe what drove the organic or the deceleration in organic growth in that segment in the second quarter versus what you saw in Q1? And also, kind of what the expectation would be going forward?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure, Matt. Yeah, EIG add 2% organic growth in Q2, but that was really a situation of large job shipping or shifting to the right. The reason that I'm not worried about it because the organic growth of EIG was 8%. So, we're very bullish on the second half of the year of EIG and it really was just a one quarter issue and it really wasn't that bad. And again, with the 8% orders growth organically, it looks good for the second half.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. And then with respect to maybe the linearity, maybe can you comment, the linearity you saw in organic orders in the quarter and whether or not the volatility we've seen in oil prices as of late has resulted in any volatility, I guess, in particular, in the EIG business? And then, if maybe you can just the close the loop on what the issue was in terms of what exactly moved out of Q2 into a later period? Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. The first point is, there's always jobs that move in and out. So, there wasn't one specific job. The orders for the quarter were generally increasing. They started April where we thought they would, and they increased and they were very strong in June. So, typical quarterly pattern, but it ended in a very strong June.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning all.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Hi, Brett.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. So, we've heard a lot from the industrial peers around price\/cost, it's been a little bit of a challenge in the quarter. Could you just talk about separately what price was? And any commodity input costs that are giving you some challenges here in Q2 or the back half?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure, Brett. Our price across the company was a little over 1 point in Q3, so that's a little over 1 point positive price. And total inflation across the company was about 1 point. So, we were a slight benefit to the P&L. And when we look out for the second half of the year, we expect similar environment. Inflation may pick up a bit, but we think we can get some more pricing also. So, because where we're at with our products, very differentiated in most of our businesses, we really don't see inflation moving through the channel yet. And I expect to maintain positive price\/cost ratio throughout the year.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And then you guys have maintained a view for flattish markets for the metal, and oil and gas businesses for the year. Any change to the guidance or expectation here? And I guess, how did orders specifically in these two businesses trend in Q2?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. That's a great question. Our EMIP business, as we went into the year, we called that flat and we mentioned in Q1 that sales were flat, but orders were slightly ahead of sales. And we continue to see improved end-market conditions with orders up sharply, and organic sales up mid-single digits in the quarter. So, if you look at EIG \u2013 EMG, had organic orders of 17%, and the EMIP business, the metals business, exceeded that rate. So, really, you've got a situation where the EMIP orders bounced back sharply.","In terms of oil and gas, it was a similar story. We entered the year \u2013 we were pleased with our first quarter performance of flat sales. Orders were a little bit ahead. Our current forecast now is for oil and gas to be up low-single digits. We now expect upstream to be up high-single digits, and the mid and downstream business to be flat.","So, we feel pretty good about both metals, and oil and gas, they were the two end-markets that caused us some headwinds. So, those headwinds are no longer there and we're performing very well, and we're very optimistic for the second half of the year.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then, specific to the metals business, are you able to parse out what was price versus volume in the quarter?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","I think it was a couple of points of EMIP, which was related to metals inflation, if you will, and then the balance was underlying growth in the business.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. You've actually got Sawyer Rice on here for Nigel. Just wondering if we could \u2013 you guys could help us think about the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar here. Just kind of what's the embedded FX in the top-line guide? And are you guys seeing any changes in the competitive environment globally due to the weaker dollar?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure. It's a great question. We saw roughly 1 point of FX headwind to sales in Q2, which was similar to what we saw in Q1. With the dollar weakening a bit recently, we expect there to be no real FX impact in Q3 and likely a bit of a tailwind in Q4, if it stays as it is. So, for the full year, we expect a modest FX headwind turning around in Q4. And as we talked about the last year, when the dollar was strengthening \u2013 we're a big exporter from the U.S. We export about $1 billion. And with the currency weakening, with the dollar weakening, it's certainly going to improve our competitiveness. So, we're encouraged with that.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then maybe if I can just get a follow-up in here on M&A, wondering what the purchase price accounting impact was for the quarter and any way to kind of help us bridge core versus M&A impact on margins into the back half of the year here? Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. What I can tell you is that, as the \u2013 we already talked about the core operating income margins being up 30 bps, 22.7%. And if we look at the EIG and the EMG segments, the group level, the operating income on a core basis was up 50 bps and \u2013 for EIG, and it was up 60 bps for EMG. So, we had really good performance and we had some below-the-line G&A stuff and that included covering the one-time costs and the acquisition costs that we don't typically carve out. So, the underlying business is strong and what you saw was the reported operating margins of 21.8%, that included all that acquisition-related work.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","You know I'm going to ask my typical question about laying things out within the divisions, but I would also like to tack on to it, if I may, what was the sort of one-time isolated cost of the Executive Chairman charge? It looks like it was in corporate?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah, if you look at our G&A costs, we were up about $5 million over last year and about half of that was from the incentive comp that we talked about in past calls. We really had low incentive payouts in 2016 and now we're obviously performing much better. So, about half of that was the incentive comp and about half of it was related to the retirement of our Executive Chairman.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","And going around the business, I'll start with aerospace. Our overall aerospace sales were up low-single digits in the quarter. We saw a solid growth across each of our segments, including continued strong growth in our commercial OEM business. And we saw higher military sales in the quarter. We saw excellent order growth in the quarter driven by a number of large military projects that booked. They were, if you recall, talking about them in 2016, they were sliding to the right. Well, they actually booked in the first half of this year. As well as continuing solid commercial orders. So, for all of 2016, we continue to expect our aerospace business to be up low- to mid-single digits with growth expected to be across all of our each of our market segments.","Our process businesses had a solid second quarter with overall sales up mid-teens and organic sales up low-single digits. Orders were also strong in the quarter with broad-based strength. Sales for our oil and gas businesses were up low-single digits in the quarter, continuing their positive sequential trends. We now expect low-single-digit growth for oil and gas for all of 2017. As a result of the solid orders, we now expect organic sales for the process businesses to be up low- to mid-single digits for the full year.","Organic sales for our power and industrial businesses were up low-single digits in the quarter with similar levels of growth across both our power and industrial businesses. Given the strong order growth in the first half and improved heavy truck demand, we now expect organic sales for power and industrial to be up low- to mid-single digits for the full year.","Organic sales for our differentiated EMG businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter with solid growth across all of our businesses. Our EMIP business continued to see improved end-market conditions. I mentioned previously, orders were up sharply and organic sales up mid-single digits in the quarter. And for all of 2017, we now expect organic sales for all of differentiated EMG to be up low- to mid-single digits versus 2016.","And finally, organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were up high-single digits in the second quarter as this business continues to perform very well. For 2017, we continue to expect sales for this business to be up low- to mid-single digits organically.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate it. You don't mind my sneaking one more in here.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Your third quarter organic sales guidance, I think you said low single digit?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes. That's correct. Q3 sales will be up about 10% and we have organic sales up low-single digits.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And when we compare that to the organic orders of the first half, which were up double digit, can you kind of connect those dots?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right, I'll connect those dots. The first point is Q4 will be a bit stronger than Q3, the way the backlog is playing out, and the orders were very strong, as your point, with broad-based improvement across all of our end markets. Many of our orders have multi-quarter or multi-year patterns as customers return to their normal ordering pattern. So, as an example of our EMIP business that we talked about, customers place blanket orders that typically ship over the course of the year. So, we're executing very well. We have a high degree of confidence in our outlook. We do feel good about how the year is playing out, but it's just the fact that the orders that are being placed are more in our mid- and long-cycle businesses, like our military business, like our metals, our EMIP business and those are more multi-quarter, multi-year ordering patterns.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks a lot.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Welcome.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Pardon me, Bhupender, please check \u2013 okay.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Hey. Good morning, guys.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hello, Bhupender.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Hey. So, my question is around MOCON, if you can just give us some color on how that acquisition is progressing, just give us some color on the sales and orders? And how much of, if any, accretion from that acquisition is going to contribute towards the guidance here in 2017?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, MOCON will be neutral to EPS in 2017. It's about a $70 million revenue deal. It's an outstanding company. MOCON has a very niche hedge position in gas analysis instrumentation. It's a leading brand, very strong technology intellectual property position, strong growth profile. It's been a mid-single-digit grower in a non-cyclical market. Solid aftermarket mix. So, it checks a lot of our boxes and we're very pleased with the acquisition. But again, it will be neutral to EPS in 2017.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Got it. And I just wanted to get a roundup on a geographical region...","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","...Dave, usual. Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, the U.S. was up 1%, so it continued improving sequential trend. You recall, the Q3 2016, it was a negative double digits, and in Q4, it went to negative 2%. Q1, it was flat; and Q2 was plus 1%. So continue that sequential improvement in orders and sales. But the one thing that we're encouraged with, orders were very strong, in line with the overall company orders. So, we saw a significant change in orders in the U.S. Europe was up 6%, in line with recent trends, and it was broad based. Notable strength in our process businesses. Our Dunkermotoren business continued to perform very strong. The Middle East was very strong for us, and it resulted in a lot of strength in Europe, Asia performed very well, up 10%, driven by strength in our analytical instruments business. China was up 11%, so that's two quarters in a row where China has been very strong. Japan up 9%. India was up 40%. It's a smaller part of AMETEK, but very strong orders growth. So, really when you look across the globe, Bhupender, all regions were \u2013 all major regions were improving, and orders were ahead of sales. So, we feel good about that.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you so much.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hi, Allison.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Could you talk a little bit about incrementals in the back half of 2017. If I remember correctly, the oil and gas and metals business typically carried higher incrementals. I mean should we assume that or is there some mix issues in the back half?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes, we have some mix issues that we talked about earlier in the year. But the EIG core margins up 50 bps and EMG core margins up 60 bps, we feel pretty good about the second half of the year. So, overall, for the business, we had incrementals of 30% in Q2, so about the same as Q1. And we said that we'd be up in incrementals from 20 bps to 60 bps for the year. So, we feel we're performing very well. We're getting the pull through on the incremental volume, and I would expect it to continue at the same level it is.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's great. And then, obviously, oil stabilizing sort of at $45, maybe $55 range. As you look at the sustainability of that business for you, are there any concerns, any sort of pullback that you're seeing in inquiries? Can you just talk about maybe customer dynamics sort of in this range, maybe for the next 12 months here?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, we feel really good about it. What we're seeing \u2013 we make manufactured capital equipment. So, there was some excess capacity in the market that needed to be utilized. But we're seeing increased activity. We're seeing it in the upstream market, as I said before, up high-single digits. We're seeing strong aftermarket MRO business across the globe. The mid and downstream market, we're calling that maybe down this year to flat. We're feeling more confident because we booked some significant project business in the Middle East. We had some businesses that were not penetrated in the Middle East. We made some investments and we booked some substantial project business. So, that project business kind of takes the risk off the table, from my viewpoint, for midstream and downstream for the balance of the year. So, we feel pretty good about it. We didn't get ahead ourself and we're still accelerating.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter and a good start to the year, although not entirely a surprise, I suppose. I guess, the first question I would have is, maybe you could just kind of give us the latest kind of state of your balance sheet, balance sheet capacity, complexion of deals you're looking at, size and scope, so we just have a good sense of kind of what your M&A firepower is over the next 12 to 24 months?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right, right. I think Bill might have mentioned before that when you take the cash and the existing credit facilities, there's about $1.5 billion of firepower there. But more importantly is the operating cash flow of the business. We're going to generate about $800 million of operating cash flow. It's a CapEx light or an asset light business model. So, we'll spend about 1.8% or 1.9% of sales, about $80 million, on CapEx. So, that leaves $720 million of free cash flow to deploy on acquisitions. And we've already deployed about $520 million on MOCON and Rauland. So, really not constrained with our current strategy with our balance sheet \u2013 a lot of optionality and a lot of firepower.","You talked about the M&A pipeline. Our pipeline remains active. We're very excited about the quality and breadth of our deal pipeline. As we said before, we have a dedicated team of about 10 M&A professionals who work closely with our businesses to identify strategic acquisitions. We're in a lot of niche markets and this allows for a broad set of opportunities from which we can identify the best fit. So, it allows us to remain disciplined in our return metrics and we select the deals that we add the most synergy to. So, we have excellent capability in the deal sourcing and the whole M&A team from deal sourcing, deal modeling, diligence, integration, and very bullish on M&A and very bullish on the future for AMETEK.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And just a couple more. On the oil and gas exposure, could you just give us some sense of your business in terms of the sizing now? And then, specifically, just given the oil and gas swoon we've seen, how should we get concerned if we see oil pull back again versus maybe some structural or comp-aided led recovery here? Meaning, basically, could we be in a situation where you expect to see line of sight to low- to mid-single-digit growth well into 2018 despite what we could see in normal variations of the price of oil?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. We haven't talked about 2018 yet. But certainly, we've already booked some orders for 2018, those large projects in the Middle East that I talked about two quarters in a row. And we think the price of oil in that $45 to $50 range is fine. It allows us to \u2013 we have very differentiated products. We have a captive aftermarket. That aftermarket's about one-third of the business. The business is geographically dispersed, about one-third in the U.S., two-thirds international. And during the downturn, we continued to invest in our market position. So, we feel really good about it. We're not expecting it to turn into the gung ho times of the past. At that time, it was about $400 million in revenue for AMETEK, and now it's about $240 million in sales entering 2017.","So, it's about 6% of the company; 20% upstream, 80% mid, downstream. So, 20% upstream, 80% in mid, downstream. And at the current price of oil, we're seeing increased activities. So, customers are talking to us about orders. They have capital spend. The authority to spend is back in the business units, instead of the C-suite. And we had some modest expectations coming into the year, and we feel solid that we're going to achieve them or beat them.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then just the last more of an editorial comment. I mean, have you looked at the potentially \u2013 a lot of your competitors have moved \u2013 or not competitors, but public comparables, I suppose, have moved to looking at kind of cash earnings, just given the nature of their business models and the compounding kind of the M&A business model, which is similar to yours, obviously. Have you looked at that? And just in the context of just your strong operating and free cash flow generation?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right, we do have tremendous free cash flow generation. And if we reported EBITDA, it would add 4 points or so to our earnings. But we haven't made a decision and we're not looking at changing right now. So, at this point, we figure you're smart enough to figure that out. And we have a GAAP quarter, GAAP 2018 \u2013 GAAP 2017 and versus GAAP in 2016. But we have noted that we are getting increased questions, but we really haven't looked at it in detail and we haven't made a decision to move to that, by any means.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Hi, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. I've got question for Bill on the working capital improvement. Just \u2013 well, are you targeting a specific working capital sales? Where are the improvements coming from and how are you getting there?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're pleased with where we were at 17.9%. I think we've been as low in the past as in the mid- to low-17s. I think that'd be a good place for us to get to again and we're certainly working towards that. I think the area for greatest opportunity, and we did see improvement in that this quarter, is around inventories. But we continue to push on all facets, both receivables as well as payables in addition to inventory. But I think when you look at our company, inventories are the greatest area of opportunity, if you will.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then how about pension and you made the contribution last quarter, what's the status?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Plan is performing very well. We're about 110% funded domestically. Internationally, in the UK, we're a little bit underfunded, we're around about 90%. So, from that perspective, our plans are fully, on an overall basis, very, very well funded. Returns of the plan have been very good, this year's year-to-date, as you'd expect, given the state of markets around the world. So, we're very comfortable with our fundings around our pension plans and, at this point, wouldn't expect any further fundings other than the small numbers that need to go in on a regular basis into the UK plans, but nothing of significance.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question about second half. As I look at your change in your organic top-line growth and I just look at the change in EPS, and if I just sort of base the calculation on incrementals for the second half, are there any headwinds in the second half \u2013 sort of I guess, it's the continuation of operating leverage question in the second half. But are there any issues related to M&A or one-time charges in the second half that we should consider thinking about EPS?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","No, no, not really. When you look at the second half of the year, the simple economics are we raised our organic sales growth from low-single digits to low to mid-single digits. So, that's roughly on $60 million increase. And if we get a 30% pull through, that gives you about $18 million, and that's about $0.05 or $0.06. So, that's the economics of it, very simply. So...","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. And then I sort of took into consideration what you guys did this quarter, maybe I'm nit-picking, right.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. Yeah. And we do expect the organic growth for the second half of the year to be a lot like the first half with Q4 a bit stronger than Q3.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got you. So, same math. Just a question on visibility. How much visibility do you have in China? You sort of highlighted strong orders there, but do you think you have visibility into next spring after this big party Congress that they're going to have?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, we haven't done any planning for 2018 yet. And we're still focused on 2017. And for 2017, we have solid visibility for the remainder of the year. China looks like it's going to be strong for us.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just one question on your aerospace business, more longer-term question. So, when you seeing Boeing starting to in-source and creating an avionics department, then how does that make you \u2013 how do you think about your existing business in light of that kind of trend and how does it make you \u2013 does it make you want to think about your positioning longer term differently than you would have a little while ago?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","No. It doesn't. I mean, we're now placed on the value chain in the aerospace industry, where, from my view, it's the place to be. We're not at the system integrator level, selling to Boeing. We're down on the differentiated components. And typically, when we do some type of electronics, it's typically around our unique sensing technology, to put together a subsystem for a person that's a system integrator. So, the types of works that we have is driven by our sensor technology, which is proprietary, and also the projects that we get involved, I don't think that we have any effect with Boeing creating the avionics business unit. That may have a bigger effect upstream from us, at the system integrator level, but it won't affect our business.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just to kind of follow-on Andrew's question earlier on the guide. I know I'm probably beating a dead horse here a bit, but a $0.05 bump at the midpoint off of a $0.04 beat to your 2Q, plus with FX moving in your direction, just what are any like offsets that we needed to think of? Obviously, with the organic raise, and the FX, and the beat here, it sums to more than the magnitude of raise. So, what do you look at as the offsets there?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, the one offset will be the continuing compensation in the quarters that we've dealt with the first half of the year. But we're executing very well and we have a high degree of confidence in our outlook. And as you said, we did raise our guidance for $0.05 at the midpoint, and it was more than our beat for the quarter. So, there may be a bit of conservatism, but we feel very good about how the year's playing out.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And if I can just \u2013 on EMG, specifically, the incrementals there looked a little bit lighter just given the magnitude of the organic growth in quarter. Is there anything specific in the quarter that you'd point to there?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","No, EMG's incrementals are a little bit lower than EIG's. So, there isn't anything that's notable there.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","William J.

I'll now turn the meeting over to Frank.","Frank Hermance","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. AMETEK had a really fine first quarter. We established quarterly records for orders, sales, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share. We also remained very active on the acquisition front, acquiring Teseq and VTI Instruments in the first quarter and on April 11, we announced the definitive merger agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of Zygo Corporation.","I will touch on our continued strong acquisition performance in more detail later, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were up 10% to $975.3 million. Organic sales increased 3% while acquisitions added 7% and currency added less than 1%.","Operating income for the first quarter increased 12% to $221.6 million from $197.2 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our operational excellence activities. Operating income margin in the quarter was 22.7%, a 40-basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2013. Net income was up 12% to $140.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.57 were up 12% over last year\u2019s first quarter and at the top end of our guidance range. ","Orders in the quarter were a record $998 million, up 14% overall from the prior year, driven by solid organic growth and contributions from the recent acquisitions. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.02. Operating working capital was 17.9% of sales. ","Turning our attention to the individual operating groups, the electronic instruments group had a very strong first quarter. Sales were up 18% to a record $572.4 million on strength in our longer-cycle aerospace and process businesses as well as strong growth in our heavy truck business.","Overall, growth was also driven by the contributions from the acquisition of Controls Southeast, Creaform, Powervar, Teseq, and VTI. Organic sales were very solid, up 5%, while currency was flat. EIG\u2019s operating income increased 14% to $150.3 million, and operating margins were 26.3%. Excluding the dilutive impact on operating margins of recent acquisitions, EIG\u2019s operating margins would have been 27.6%, up 40 basis points from last year\u2019s quarter. ","The electromechanical group also had a good quarter, with strong operating performance. Sales were up 1% to a record $409.2 million. Organic sales were flat, and foreign currency was a 1% tailwind. ","Strength in our precision motion control and thermal management systems businesses was offset by softness in our third-party aerospace MRO business as a result of a very difficult prior year comparison. EMG\u2019s operating income increased 8% to a record $83.9 million, and operating margins were superb at 20.8%, up 120 basis points from last year\u2019s first quarter. ","Now, turning our attention to our core growth strategies of operational excellence, global market expansion, new product development, and strategic acquisitions. The solid execution of these growth strategies by our employees is the principal reason for our ongoing success. Each of these strategies will continue to play a key role in driving our growth.","First, I will touch on operational excellence. Operational excellence is our cornerstone strategy. We continue to see tremendous results from our various operational excellence initiatives. Operational excellence activities include Lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back office opportunities, Design for Six Sigma and our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, movement of production to low-cost locales, and value engineering. ","In the first quarter, our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives recognized approximately $17 million in savings, exceeding our target for the quarter. We continue to expect approximately $90 million in total cost savings in 2014 through our operational excellence initiatives, including $60 million in savings through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives.","Now turning to global and market expansion, our seconds strategy, global and market expansion continues to be an important contributor to our growth as we are increasingly expanding our presence in attractive higher-growth market segments and geographic regions. ","In the first quarter of 2014, international sales represented 56% of our total sales. This was up from 55% of sales in the first quarter of 2013. The increase in international sales percentage was driven by very strong organic growth in Asia as well as the contributions from recent acquisitions.","Organic sales in Asia were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the first quarter, with notable strength across our process and differentiated EMG businesses. This strong growth reflects the benefits of our continued focus on expanding our sales, service, and distribution capabilities in this region.","We will continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities, and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities.","Now turning to new product development, new product development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long term health and growth. We have consistently grown our investment in RD&E to ensure we are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets.","In 2014, we expect to spend approximately $205 million, a 15% increase over 2013. And we are excited about some recent new product introductions within our aerospace and defense businesses. ","First, AMETEK Rotron has developed a heat exchanger for pod-mounted optical and electronics systems aboard various aircraft, including helicopters and drones. The Discus thermal management system offers greater cooling capabilities and lower weight than other systems. Its novel design separates external cooling air from compartment air, which is a key advantage for protecting sensitive optical and electronic equipment from possible contaminants. We are seeing very strong interest in this new product. ","Secondly, AMETEK sensors and fluid management systems has introduced the first digital humidity sensor for aircraft environmental control systems. The sensor is the smartest and most attractive humidity sensor available and is intended for air ducting that carries humidified air into aircraft passenger compartments. The sensor utilizes advanced capacitance technology and signal processing to quickly and accurately measure humidity levels. ","And also, AMETEK EDAX has developed an entirely new technique for users of scanning electron microscopes that provides them with unprecedented flexibility in conducting microstructure analysis. ","The technique, which is known as pattern region of interest analysis, or PRIAS, represents a breakthrough in advanced material analysis by combining fast imaging capabilities with powerful image manipulation and analysis tools for use in scanning electron microscopes. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 20% of sales in the first quarter. ","Now, turning our attention to acquisitions, we\u2019ve had a very active start to 2014. In the first quarter, we completed two acquisitions, Teseq, which we acquired in January, and VTI Instruments, which we acquired in February. Combined, we deployed approximately $165 million on these two acquisitions, and acquired approximately $90 million in sales. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we announced that we had signed a merger agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of Zygo Corporation. ","This strong acquisition performance in 2014 follows the strong activity we saw in the second half of 2013, where we acquired three businesses. If the Zygo transaction closes as expected by the end of the second quarter, we will have acquired six businesses, deployed approximately $850 million in capital, and acquired $425 million in annual revenue over the prior 12 months.","Now, let me provide some more detail on the VTI Instruments acquisition and the Zygo announcement. VTI Instruments is a leading producer of highly engineered test and measurement instrumentation. Their products include signal conditioning solutions and data acquisition systems for use in structural, fatigue, temperature, noise, vibration, and harshness testing.","VTI is a leader in the high-end niche for data acquisition systems for use in demanding testing environments requiring high measurement accuracy such as the aerospace and defense markets. The acquisition of VTI Instruments nicely expands our test and measurement capabilities within this attractive market segment. They are headquartered in Irvine, California, and they have annual sales of approximately $40 million.","On April 11, we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Zygo Corporation at a purchase price of $19.25 per share. The aggregate enterprise value of the transaction is approximately $280 million, taking into account Zygo\u2019s outstanding equity awards and net cash, which we will acquire.","Zygo Corporation is a leading provider of non-contract metrology solutions, high precision optics, and optical assemblies for use in semiconductor, medical, life science, industrial, and aerospace and defense end markets. They are really a great fit with AMETEK. They have a high-value, differentiated technology capability and strong brands within the optical and metrology markets.","Also, Zygo\u2019s leading position in non-contact optical metrology nicely complements our strength in contact metrology. Zygo has annual sales of approximately $165 million and they are headquartered in Middlefield, Connecticut. The closing of the transaction is subject to customer closing conditions including the approval of Zygo stockholders and applicable regulatory approvals.","We expect to close the transaction towards the end of the second quarter. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us in the remainder of 2014, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunity remains very strong, and we have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to continue to support this acquisitions focus. ","Turning now to the outlook for the remainder of 2014, we expect our businesses overall to continue to show solid growth during 2014, with balanced organic growth across both operating groups. We anticipate 2014 revenue to be up high single-digits on a percentage basis from 2013. Organic growth is expected to be up 2% to 4% for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups.","Earnings for 2014 are expected to be in the range of $2.32 to $2.37 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% over 2013, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, our operational excellence initiatives, and the benefit of contributions from recent acquisitions. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $2.30 to $2.35 per diluted share, and does not include the impact of the announced Zygo acquisition. ","Second quarter 2014 sales are expected to be up approximately 10% from last year\u2019s second quarter, with organic growth up low single digits. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.57 to $0.59 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% over last year\u2019s second quarter.","So, in summary, we delivered excellent results in the quarter, and are well-positioned for the remainder of 2014. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that will provide us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our excellent backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2014.","Bob will now cover some of the financial details and then we will be glad to take your questions.","Robert Mandos ","Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a great first quarter, with very strong overall results. I will provide some further details.","Core growth in selling expenses was in line with core growth in sales in the quarter. General and administrative expenses were roughly flat versus last year. On a percentage basis, G&A was 1.3% of sales, down slightly from last year\u2019s first quarter level of 1.4% of sales.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.3% versus last year\u2019s first quarter rate of 29.1%. For 2014, we expect our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.","On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 17.9% of sales in the first quarter, up slightly from last year\u2019s first quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. ","Capital expenditures were $14 million for the quarter. Full year 2014 capital expenditures are expected to be $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $33 million for the quarter. 2014 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $137 million.","Operating cash flow was $161 million, up 3% over last year\u2019s first quarter. Free cash flow was $147 million for the quarter, representing 104% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 110% of net income.","Total debt was $1.41 billion at March 31, essentially unchanged from the 2013 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $265 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at March 31 of 25.9%, down slightly from 26.3% at the end of 2013. At March 31, we had approximately $865 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. ","During the quarter, we acquired Teseq and VTI Instruments. Total capital deployed on these acquisitions was approximately $165 million. On April 11, we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of Zygo Corporation. Total capital to be deployed on this acquisition will be approximately $280 million, taking into account net cash to be acquired. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. ","In summary, we had a very strong first quarter, establishing record levels of orders, sales, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share. We are well-positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.","Kevin Coleman","Great. Thank you, Bob. Operator, we\u2019ll now open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. ","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc","Frank, if you could just sort of do the deeper dive that you typically do on the call with respect to the operating groups, what you saw during the quarter and what your expectations are for the year?","Frank Hermance ","We\u2019ll start with EIG. Our EIG aerospace business had a strong quarter on continued strength in commercial aerospace. Sales were up approximately 10% organically in the quarter and orders were also very strong, up high single-digits. ","And as we look to the remainder of 2014, we expect continued strength in our EIG aerospace business. Trends in OEM build rates support really good commercial sales, while the continued ramp up of key business and regional jet platforms also will provide solid growth. ","As a side note, if you look at Boeing and Airbus, their production this year, the sum of the two is expected to be up about 6%, with Boeing actually up about 12% and Airbus up about 1%. So very good, solid performance here in terms of the aerospace market itself.","So for all of 2014, we are estimating EIG aerospace would be up mid-single digits and we may very well be conservative on that outlook.","Moving to our process businesses, the overall performance of our process businesses was superb. Sales were up midteens on a percentage basis, with organic sales up high single-digits. Organic growth was broad-based across our process businesses, with strength in our Micro-Poise, UPT technology, measurement and calibration technology, and our material analysis operations.","So this is a bit of a change, where if you look at the beginning of last year, this business was being driven by oil and gas. Oil and gas is still fine, but now we\u2019re really seeing broad-based recovery in the process businesses.","The overall growth was also driven by the contributions from the Controls Southeast, Creaform, and VTI acquisitions. So for the full year, we expect our process businesses to grow high single-digits overall, with organic growth up low to mid-single digits.","The last part of EIG is power and industrial. Sales for power and industrial were up about 30% in the first quarter, really driven by the contribution from the recent acquisitions of Powervar and Teseq. Organically, sales for power and industrial were flat, and as a result of these recent acquisitions in the power segment, we expect overall sales for power and industrial to be up approximately 30% in 2014 with organic growth up low to mid-single digits.","So, Matt, if you take those three parts of EIG and sum them, for all of EIG we\u2019re expecting overall 2014 sales to be up midteens on a percentage basis, with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. ","Moving to the other half of the company, overall sales for our differentiated businesses were up low single digit on a percentage basis in the quarter. We saw very solid growth in our precision motion control and thermal systems business, but it was offset by weakness in our third-party MRO business and that was driven really as the result of a very difficult last year comparison in that MRO business. ","For 2014, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up low to mid-single digits on an organic basis. And the last part of the company, which is floor care and specialty motors, sales in our floor care and specialty motors businesses were up low single digits in the quarter and for all of 2014, we expect sales for this business to be up low single digits.","So if you sum those pieces of EMG, for all of EMG, for 2014, we are expecting overall growth of low to mid-single digits. And if you take the results I just went over and take EIG and EMG together, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, for AMETEK as a whole we expect this high single-digit sales growth with organic growth up 2% to 4%. So Matt, that\u2019s a summary.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc ","Thank you so much. And then just one quick follow up. Organic bookings in the quarter, and then where your backlog ended?","Frank Hermance ","Backlog ended at $1.2 billion. It was up from $1.1 billion as I mentioned. Orders were up about 14% overall to $998 million, and organically, that was up about in line with sales. It was 2.5% organically.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. ","Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo","On acquisitions, Frank, you touched on managerial capacity. And you\u2019ve done a number of acquisitions here. Are there any management constraints that are causing you to maybe refocus near term what you\u2019re thinking of acquiring? ","Frank Hermance ","No, not at all. One of the advantages of the way we have evolved the company is we have a number of what I would call sublegs in the company, where we can put deals in. And as we look at our deals, I surely don\u2019t want multiple deals being driven by the same management team, but because we have these other legs, we can continue to do this. And one of the really positive things here is a number of our divisions now have risen in their capability, where in essence they can handle the deals, where if you go back in time, they were more handled by us at the corporate level. ","So we can continue to do this, we can continue to roll them up. Obviously, we\u2019re not doing the megadeals, which then this strategy wouldn\u2019t work. But by buying these companies that are in the $50 million to $200 million in sales region, we can continue this, and we really don\u2019t have any significant management constraints. ","Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo ","And just going on to the sourcing area, you\u2019ve talked about you were a bit ahead in your goals, but you kept the total year the same. Did you move programs up? Is it acquisitions? How should we be thinking about that number?","Frank Hermance ","I think what you\u2019re probably going to see is that we will raise that number as we go through the rest of the year. Actually, Bob, I think when we rolled it up, it was really $92 million?","Robert Mandos ","Yes.","Frank Hermance ","It was actually $92 million, but we decided not to sort of put that extra $2 million in. But I would expect, as we go forward, that the team is doing a really superb job here and so I would expect that number to increment up as we go through the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research ","Quickly, payables?","Robert Mandos ","$370 million.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research ","Frank, looking at the slight increase in your EPS guidance for 2014, you\u2019re keeping organic growth expectations the same, so is this, with this slightly improved margin, a little better performance on the cost takeouts or the operational excellence?","Frank Hermance ","Yeah, I think that\u2019s an accurate way of talking about it. And also, if you look at the trend of organic growth in the company, the trend is definitely in a positive direction looking over the last three quarters or four quarters. So we\u2019ve been probably a bit conservative on our sales outlook. And if that organic growth does continue to creep up more towards the higher end of our guidance range, that also is going to obviously provide some more earnings. ","So we\u2019re actually feeling pretty good right now, that although this recovery is a bit slow and painful, we definitely can feel it and see it in the numbers, that there is improvement as you go quarter to quarter. It\u2019s not monumental, but it\u2019s still there, so the trend is in the right direction. So we felt pretty confident in raising the estimates that couple cents. ","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research ","Camping out on the organic growth then, I\u2019m a little surprised, given how Q1 performed, that you\u2019re still expecting 2% to 4% for each segment. Q1 is actually an easier comp, I think, for both. Q4 becomes a pretty tough comp for both. But you had 5% organic in EIG and flat organic in EMG. With the strong start in EIG, I\u2019m surprised you kept that at 2% to 4%, and with the slower start EMG, that it\u2019s still 2% to 4%.","Frank Hermance ","One of the areas of weakness that you heard me talk about was power and industrial, and that\u2019s sort of the one large segment in our business where the organic growth just is not as strong as we had hoped. And even though aerospace is doing great and our processes businesses themselves are doing very, very well, power and industrial is a bit of a drag. But what we\u2019re hoping is we\u2019re going to see incremental improvement in that as we go forward. But we haven\u2019t put that in our forecast, and that\u2019s probably the reason that we\u2019ve held that guidance a bit low on the EMG side. ","On the EMG side, we were flat in the first quarter, but we are predicting that we\u2019re going to be in that low to mid-single digits. So we do expect that to definitely improve, and that\u2019s why hopefully we\u2019re going to end up at the higher end of our overall guidance for the company of a 2% to 4% kind of number. ","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research ","Were the orders in EMG better than the sales?","Frank Hermance ","No. Orders were not as strong in EMG. Organically, they were down a bit and they were up about 6%, if I recall correctly, in EIG. But you have to be careful, when you look at orders for our businesses, because we\u2019ve got many long cycle businesses that basically you can have ups and downs in any quarter, so I wouldn\u2019t focus too much on the order intake in a given quarter. But I do think you\u2019re going to see EMG organic growth improve, and we may be conservative on EIG organic growth. That\u2019s probably the best way I can answer your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with Citi Research. ","Matt McConnell - Citi Research","Could you talk about the EMG margin a little bit? You\u2019ve had a pretty nice increase on virtually no revenue growth, so is that where you saw the upside from the cost savings, or is there something else in there that is worth calling out?","Frank Hermance ","No, it\u2019s exactly what you said, and we have been saying for a long time when we look at overall margin growth for the company, that EMG will be a key driver. Because if you look at the absolute levels of the margin between EIG and EMG, EIG was the 26.3%, I think it was, and EMG at around 20.8%. ","So there\u2019s two drivers for that. There\u2019s definitely the cost reductions and some of the improvements that we have put through the business have definitely been in EMG. There\u2019s also a natural effect that as the portion of EMG moves more to the differentiated businesses versus the floor care and specialty motors or cost driven side of that business, there will be a natural positive movement in those margins. ","And as you know, we\u2019re not buying companies or investing heavily in the floor care or specialty motors business, where we are in the differentiated EMG businesses, so you\u2019ll continue to see that basic change in the portfolio, which will also be a positive for margins.","Matt McConnell - Citi Research ","And then if I could touch on the M&A pipeline, it seems from your prepared remarks that clearly there\u2019s some activity there. So if you could highlight any particular areas where you\u2019re seeing a lot of activity? And maybe deal size. I know Zygo, at $280 million, it\u2019s a little bigger than the range that you mentioned in response to an earlier question. So do you think that is within your sweet spot now? Or maybe give us an update on what you think the sweet spot for deal size is for AMETEK now?","Frank Hermance ","Obviously the deal sizes are going to increase a bit as our overall size increases, but it\u2019s not monumental. And we have really been looking in this $50 million to $200 million in sales arena. Zygo is in the $165 million arena, so I consider that in the sweet spot. But if you look at the two other deals we did this quarter, the first one, Teseq, was I think $50 million. VTI was $40 million, so that\u2019s sort of the range that we\u2019re looking in. ","In terms of the backlog, I\u2019m delighted with the backlog right now. Our team both in corporate and the M&A people that we have put in our businesses have done just an excellent job of getting deals up on the table. And some of these deals are proprietary, where we have gone out and talked to these companies, sometimes for many, many years, and then when they are ready to sell, they will come to us, and in some cases not even go through an investment banking kind of process. ","So we have a really, I would say, solid backlog. I can tell you I\u2019m working on a deal just as we speak. I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re going to get the deal or not, but in terms of capital deployed, that particular deal would be larger than Zygo. But not, again, monumentally larger, but it would be a larger deal. ","So if I said something in my opening remarks that implied a major change, that, I don\u2019t think, is the case. It\u2019s really I would say an incremental sort of change to be looking at a little bit bigger deals, but nothing fundamental in terms of looking, for instance, for a merger of equals. That\u2019s not even in our paradigm. You\u2019re unable to get the synergies and unable to going to the returns that you guys enjoy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jeffries.","Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company ","Just wanted to ask about the progression of orders in the quarter. Were you weather affected in any way? Was March stronger? Could you lay that out a little bit?","Frank Hermance ","I would say incrementally we improved during the quarter. March was very, very good. We can\u2019t assign a major sort of factor to weather. I know a lot of companies have come out and said January and February were weaker because of weather. I really can\u2019t say that there was any substantial change due to that factor. What I\u2019m seeing, and what I\u2019m just feeling in the business, to my comments before, is we\u2019re just seeing a gradual improvement in the business, and we definitely saw that, I would say, through the quarter, with a pretty strong March.","Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company ","So the March reference that you\u2019re making here, that\u2019s on a year over year basis? That\u2019s not seasonal, right?","Frank Hermance ","Well, I was actually talking sequentially through the quarter. I wasn\u2019t talking quarter over quarter when I was making my remarks.","Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company ","That\u2019s actually what I was referring to, because obviously I think we all get stronger as the quarter progresses. I was just wondering on the year over year basis.","Frank Hermance ","Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I misinterpreted your question. On a year over year basis, yeah, it\u2019s better, there\u2019s no question. As I said, we were up just about 3 points organically in the quarter on orders. And if you look at the order progression and the sales progression, any organic growth is getting stronger. It\u2019s not monumental, but you can feel it getting stronger.","Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company "," ","There\u2019s $92 million and potentially heading higher. Obviously EMG is seeing a lot of that, but where are you finding this type of a number? Where are the heaviest concentrations of productivity right now?","Robert Mandos ","","I would say it\u2019s probably more on the global sourcing side, and it\u2019s pretty broad-based across the company. We keep looking for new opportunities. We\u2019re expanding our footprint, not just in China, but we move in other low-cost regions. Our teams work very effectively together, and we see those opportunities and we push pretty hard, as you can imagine. We\u2019re getting leverage on just the pure procurement side, but we\u2019re also getting it in the value add and value engineer. And that\u2019s a key part of how we are growing these savings. As we\u2019ve acquired companies with higher levels of technology, there\u2019s more opportunity there.","Frank Hermance ","If I could just augment what Bob said, we find when we acquire companies there\u2019s significant leverage in just procuring parts from international, so that a good part of the leverage comes from the companies that we\u2019ve recently acquired. If we look at more of our mature businesses, where they are already procuring a large amount of their material from low-cost regions, that\u2019s where the value analysis and value engineering that Bob mentioned comes into play. ","And we have really put, across the company, the training that is necessary to do value analysis and value engineering, and these are very short term projects that basically you can improve the cost of the product, largely through materials, but not solely through materials. That\u2019s more the value analysis piece, and then the value engineering piece is more in the sense of making some changes in the product so that you can get incremental sales. ","And we are now allocating a portion of our engineering talent to this VA\/VE activity, so that we can just keep this number rolling. So it\u2019s just a super strategy, and it\u2019s working extremely well for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baliotti from Janney Capital Markets.","John Baliotti - Janney Capital Markets ","Frank, you talked about the margin impact from acquisitions in EIG, which is obviously typical of new deals. But you also pointed out that EMG had very impressive margins. I think if I went back in my model, I don\u2019t think they were ever this high in the first quarter going back 15 or 20 years.","So I\u2019m wondering, it seems like that bodes very well for the things you\u2019ve been talking about, of global sourcing, just integrating the cost structure of the businesses, not to mention the revenue leverage on future EIG margins.","Frank Hermance ","I think that\u2019s right. I think your analysis is correct, and I think as we do deals, you\u2019re going to continue to see some dilutive impact on our margins, because we purposely want to buy companies where their margins are below ours, so that we can, over time, improve those businesses. ","And if you look historically, we\u2019ve always been able to outgrow that dilutive impact. So even with the dilutive impact that you\u2019ve talked about, even though we talked about it just in EIG, if you look at it at a company level, it was about 50 basis points. So we showed 40 basis points of improvement, and if you add that dilutive impact, our overall company margins would have been up 90 basis points instead of 40 basis points. ","So your discussion and what Scott just talked about and asked a question on are really the core of AMETEK. We\u2019re just really good at basically managing our businesses effectively and if our businesses come in with a budget that doesn\u2019t show sizable cost improvements, we have a long discussion about that, because we feel you\u2019ve got to be continually improving your business and continually improving your margins. And yes, I think you\u2019re going to see more improvement in EIG and EMG just because of the level of absolute margins in the EMG side of the business. ","John Baliotti - Janney Capital Markets ","You talked about obviously that you expect a lot more improvement out of EMG given the delta between the two, but it seems like you\u2019re probably going to keep raising the bar on EIG, given the near term headwinds that it faces as you do more of the M&A on that segment.","Frank Hermance ","That could be, but now remember, the Zygo acquisition, if we close it, is going to come in and it\u2019s going to go in EIG. So it\u2019s public, and therefore there\u2019s going to be a dilutive impact. But we look at that positively, because we\u2019re going to get a super return on invested capital on a deal like that.","John Baliotti - Janney Capital Markets ","I guess the conclusion was that you clearly haven\u2019t peaked on the profitability of EMG on a core basis.","Frank Hermance ","Absolutely. That\u2019s absolutely right. We have not peaked. That\u2019s absolutely right.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan of RBC Capital Markets ","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","On the geographical look, I know you talked about midteens organic growth in Asia. Can you maybe talk about what you\u2019re seeing in other geographies and maybe how you see some of the regional patterns playing out for the year?","Frank Hermance ","If you look at the organic growth by region for the first quarter, the organic growth largely came out of Asia. It was up about 17%, actually, in Asia. The U.S. was flat, but that\u2019s actually an improving trend if you look at this by sequential quarters. The U.S. is continuing to improve and we think that will continue as we go through the year.","Europe was organically up about 1%, and that\u2019s a lower number than what we had been talking about. But there was an abnormality in Europe in that as I mentioned in my remarks, the MRO business basically, which is largely European based, had a very tough comparison. ","And so if you actually extract that from the Europe organic growth, it would be similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the last few quarters, up in that mid-single digit region, and improving. I mean, again, you can feel some improvement in Europe. It\u2019s not monumental, but the improvement is there.","And then Asia, up very, very strong. And this was across Asia that we saw this. And I think I can say it\u2019s a key result of the investments that we have been putting into Asia. A large portion of our incremental growth capital or growth expense has gone into that region, and we saw broad-based performance with very strong performance in Japan, for instance, very strong performance in Singapore. Strong performance in China. Korea, Bob just mentioned, which is absolutely right. We saw strong performance there. ","You know, the markets are not great, but on the other hand, the GDPs in those countries are still higher than they are in other parts of the world. And you couple that with our lower share and investment levels, and it\u2019s doing just find for us. So we were very pleased.","So I think the expectations are, incremental improvement in the U.S., Europe will, I think, pop back a bit, just because of that tough comparison. And Asia is going to be good. Is it going to be 17% growth for the next few quarters on a quarter over quarter basis? Probably not quite that strong, but it\u2019s going to be good.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets ","And then maybe just a quick one on EIG margins. You broke out the 130 basis point impact from acquisitions. Will the impact be a little bit heavier in Q2, given the activity Zygo?","Frank Hermance ","It obviously depends on when Zygo closes, and that\u2019s going to close at the end of the quarter. So if it happens then, it\u2019s not going to have a major impact on Q2. You would see it more in Q3 than Q2. I think probably the soonest would be the second week in June. That probably won\u2019t happen, but that\u2019s the soonest. So as I\u2019m thinking about your question, there probably is not going to be any major impact, even if it closes a bit earlier in the second quarter. But you can expect to see it in the third quarter.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. Please continue with your closing remarks.","Kevin Coleman"," ","Great.

We'll begin today with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then we'll open it up for questions.","I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had an outstanding first quarter. We generated record levels of sales and orders backed by strong broad-based organic growth and significant contributions from recent acquisitions. We delivered tremendous operating performance, resulting in record-level operating income, impressive margin expansion, strong cash flow generation, and robust earnings per share growth.","We announced our second acquisition of 2018 this morning, continuing to successfully deploy capital on strategic acquisitions. And lastly, given our strong first quarter results and the positive backlog and order momentum, we've raised our full year 2018 sales and earning guidance; so overall an excellent high-quality quarter.","Now onto the financial highlights of the quarter. Total sales in the first quarter were a record $1.17 billion, up 16% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Organic sales growth was exceptional, up 8% in the quarter. Recent acquisitions added 5% and foreign currency was a 3% benefit. We continued to see broad-based organic growth across each of our businesses and key geographies. Our businesses are capitalizing on their leading niche positions in attractive markets, while also benefiting from our initiatives to improve organic growth.","We also continue to see sustained and robust orders growth. Overall orders were excellent, up 20% in the quarter, with organic orders up 12%. As a result, we ended the year with a record backlog of $1.6 billion, providing us with excellent visibility. Operating income was a record at $258.2 million in the first quarter, up 19% compared to the first quarter in 2017. Reported operating income margins were 22%, up 40 basis points over last year's first quarter.","On a core basis, operating margins were a very strong 80 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the outstanding operating leverage we generate from strong organic sales growth. Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.78, up an impressive 30% compared to the $0.60 per share reported in the same quarter of 2017.","Now, turning to the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group; our EIG businesses are performing exceptionally well across our key market segments. First quarter sales for EIG were $716.4 million, up 16% versus the prior year. Organic sales were strong, up 6% and the acquisitions of Rauland, MOCON and Arizona Instrument contributed another 6%. Foreign currency was a 3-point tailwind for the quarter.","While organic growth was broad based, we saw particular strength in our Process & Analytical Instruments and Ultra Precision Technologies divisions during the quarter. EIG's first quarter operating income was $183.4 million, up 18% over the first quarter of 2017. And reported operating income margins increased 50 basis points to 25.6%. On a core basis, EIG margins were up 90 basis points over the prior year.","The Electromechanical Group also had a fantastic quarter. EMG sales for the quarter were a record $456.2 million, up 18% over the same quarter in 2017. Organic sales increased an impressive 11% with continued broad-based strength across our automation, engineered materials and thermal management systems businesses. Recently acquired FMH Aerospace contributed an additional 2% and foreign currency provided a 4-point tailwind.","EMG's operating income in the quarter was $91 million, an increase of 16% compared to the same quarter in 2017. Reported operating margins for the quarter were strong at 19.9% with core margins up 30 basis points versus the first quarter of 2017.","To summarize, first quarter results were superb. Our colleagues continued to drive incredible performance for AMETEK's operating model and the execution of our four growth strategies. We remain focused on investing in our businesses and our people to best position us for sustained long-term success.","Before I discuss our updated outlook for 2018, let me highlight some of the achievements we have experienced from our growth strategies. First, acquisitions; we're off to a great start in 2018 with two acquisitions completed so far. In January, we completed the acquisition of FMH Aerospace, a leading provider of highly-engineered and differentiated components for use in the aerospace, defense and space markets. We are very excited about the acquisition of FMH as it expands our solution offerings across a wide range of attractive aerospace and defense platforms.","We are also very excited to announce the acquisition of SoundCom Corporation (sic) [SoundCom Systems] and we welcome the team to AMETEK. SoundCom, which is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, designs, integrates and services clinical workflow and communication systems for end users in the healthcare, government and educational markets. SoundCom also serves as a value-added reseller for our recently acquired Rauland business in Ohio and Michigan, joining existing value-added resellers Rauland currently owns in Florida and California.","Rauland, which we acquired in the first quarter of 2017, is a leading global provider of mission-critical clinical communication systems and workflow solutions to hospitals, healthcare systems and educational facilities. Rauland was the foundation of a new strategic growth platform in the attractive healthcare solutions market. It was an attractive acquisition for AMETEK, given the strong growth dynamics across the healthcare markets it serves as well as the opportunity to expand the Rauland platform through acquisitions.","SoundCom is an excellent addition to this platform as it expands Rauland's value-added reseller footprint into high-density healthcare and educational markets in Ohio and Michigan. Value-added resellers such as SoundCom are key in the delivery and service of complex electronic workflow and communications systems developed by Rauland. SoundCom has annual sales of approximately $40 million. With the acquisition of SoundCom, we have now deployed approximately $275 million on two acquisitions thus far in 2018 and since the beginning of 2017, we had deployed approximately $835 million on five acquisitions.","Acquisitions remain the top priority for deployment of our free cash flow. Our deal pipeline remains very healthy and AMETEK's tremendous cash flow generation and balance sheet strength, plus the additional flexibility provided by tax reform, we are very well positioned to strategically pursue attractive acquisition candidates. We also remain well positioned to invest in organic growth through new products and solutions, front-end sales and service optimization, and production efficiencies.","Our businesses continue to unveil new products and solutions that are solving our customers' greatest challenges. For example, our Zygo business, part of AMETEK's Ultra Precision Technologies division, launched two next-generation 3D optical profilers during the first quarter. The Nexview NX2 and NewView 9000 3D optical profiling instruments provide highly precise non-contact measurement of a surface area across a wide range of markets and applications, including consumer electronics, automotive, semiconductor, medical, nanotechnology and materials science.","These latest offerings provide significant improvements in both performance and functionality, enabling non-destructive and precise 3D measurement, including step heights, roughness, film thickness, and surface form on a broad range of sample types. New products such as these are key drivers to sustained organic growth and the long-term success of AMETEK.","One way we measure the success of our new product development efforts is through our vitality index which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions introduced within the last three years. In the first quarter, our vitality index was excellent at 25%, reflecting the excellent work of our research, development and engineering teams.","In 2018, we expect to increase our RD&E investment by 6% year-over-year to approximately $235 million. Additionally, our businesses continued to drive impressive productivity improvements and cost reduction through our operational excellence initiatives. In 2018, we anticipate OpEx savings of approximately $85 million, with a majority of these savings being generated by global sourcing and strategic procurement activities.","Our global sourcing team also does an excellent job helping us manage potential inflationary impacts across our supply chain and through the identification and qualification of alternative sources of supply and through active management of our supplier base. We are closely monitoring these potential inflationary factors and are comfortable we will be able to more than offset inflation with price increases in 2018.","Finally, we are seeing significant expansion into adjacent markets around the globe. International sales were 52% of AMETEK's total sales, with strong organic growth across all key geographical regions. Specifically, we saw excellent broad-based organic growth in Asia as our businesses continued to expand their presence in attractive growth regions.","With that said, let me touch on our updated outlook for 2018. For the full year, we now anticipate overall sales to be up low-double digits, with organic sales up mid-single digits. Earnings per share for 2018 are now expected to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.12, up 17% to 20% from 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.61. This is an increase from our initial guidance range of $2.95 to $3.05.","For the second quarter, overall sales are projected to be up approximately 10%, with organic sales up mid-single digits compared to the second quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share in the second quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.78, up 17% to 20% compared to the second quarter of 2017.","In summary, AMETEK started off the year with outstanding performance. Our world-class teams and their businesses have positioned the company for another record year. AMETEK's foundation is strong and we are focused on delivering long-term success through the execution of our four growth strategies.","I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK started the year with an outstanding quarter, generating record results and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights. In the first quarter, core selling expenses were up in line with core sales growth. General, administrative expenses in the first quarter were flat compared to 2017 and as a percentage of sales were 1.4% down from last year's first quarter level of 1.6% of sales.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.1% versus last year's rate of 27.4% and in line with our expectations. The year-over-year reduction in our effective tax rate was due to the benefits of tax reform. We continue to estimate our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 23% and as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.","Working capital was excellent at 16.8% of sales in the first quarter, reflecting the outstanding performance of our businesses. Capital expenditures were $12 million for the quarter and we expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $85 million or 1.8% of sales. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $49 million and for the full year, we expect D&A to be approximately $200 million.","First quarter operating cash flow was $177 million, up 25% compared to the first quarter of 2017, and free cash flow in the quarter was $165 million, up 28% over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 91% in the quarter, slightly better than our expectations and we continue to expect excellent full year free cash flow conversion of 120% of net income.","As Dave mentioned, we've been very active on the acquisition front, deploying approximately $275 million on the acquisitions of FMH Aerospace and SoundCom thus far in 2018. Total debt at March 31 was $2.21 billion, up from $2.17 billion at the end of 2017. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $557 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at March 31 of 28.2%. Following the acquisitions of FMH Aerospace and SoundCom, we have more than $1.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.","In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the first quarter, delivering record-level results and a high quality of earnings. We remain well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Great, thank you, Bill. Victor, can we please open the call up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, all.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. I wanted to \u2013 I know you said, Dave, that you expect price\/cost to be positive on a full-year basis. Could you maybe be specific with us for at least the quarter, sort of what price was versus what inflation was?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure, Scott. In Q1, we achieved price of about 1.4% and total inflation was about 1.2%. We were able to more than offset inflationary cost with increased pricing and I think the results speak to the differentiated nature of our product portfolio and our leadership position in our niche markets and our outstanding supply chain capability, and we expect that to continue for the year and we'll be able to offset inflation with price.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got you. However, those numbers should both drift up a little bit after what we saw with commodities inflation in the first quarter?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, I think you could see them both going up through the course of the year.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Also, could you sort of do your typical by division synopsis of what's happening and what you expect? Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure, Scott. I'll start with the process business. Our process businesses had an outstanding start to the year. Overall sales were up 20%. High-single-digit organic growth and contributions from the Rauland and MOCON acquisitions were the key drivers. Continuing the trend from last year, we saw strong broad-based organic growth in the quarter with particularly solid growth across our Zygo, Creaform, TMC, Precitech and Energy & Process Instrumentation businesses. And for all of 2018, we continue to expect broad-based strength with our organic sales up mid-single digits.","Overall aerospace sales were up low-teens in the quarter, driven by contributions from recently acquired FMH and mid-single-digit organic growth. Growth remained strong across our military businesses as we are seeing solid demand both in the U.S. and internationally, and we're also seeing continued solid growth across our commercial aerospace and aftermarket businesses. They had a very good quarter. For all of 2018, we continue to expect organic sales growth for aerospace businesses to be up mid-single digits with solid growth across each market segment.","Our power and industrial businesses saw strong growth in the first quarter with overall sales up 10%, driven by mid-single-digit organic growth and contributions from recently acquired Arizona Instrument. Growth was solid in both our power and industrial segments with notable strength across our power test and measurement business, including programmable power and VTI. And for 2018, we now expect power and industrial organic sales to be up mid-single digits.","And finally, our automated (sic) [automation] and engineered solutions business had an excellent start to the year, with low-double-digit organic sales growth in the first quarter. We continued to see strong sales and order strengths across both our automation businesses and our engineered solutions business. In 2018, we now expect mid to high-single-digit organic sales growth for all of our automated (sic) [automation] and engineered solutions businesses. That's around the horn, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got you. Thank you very much.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","William J.

You may begin.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hey, Dave. So, SoundCom's kind of interesting. It sounds like a little more of a services business than we're used to. So, just curious how much of that is tied to Rauland and maybe a little deeper dive on how you view the bolt-on runway in the communication systems arena.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right, right. SoundCom is a value-added reseller for Rauland and they actually represent about 5% of Rauland's sales, and they're in high-density healthcare markets of Ohio and Michigan. And Rauland \u2013 the VARs are very important to the Rauland model. So, they've had a long-term business relationship and Rauland has VARs in some regions that they own. I mentioned Florida and California, and this was a natural logical adjacency. So, they have customers that include large healthcare systems like the Cleveland Clinic, Mercy Health, educational facilities like Ohio State, Michigan State, and they're really key to Rauland because they provide the deep technical expertise in designing and integrating the advanced solutions that Rauland delivers.","They have integrated solutions that move Rauland closer to the end customer. So, it positions really the value-added resellers, Rauland is a natural acquirer for those type of companies in high-density population areas and they also make Rauland a natural acquirer for attractive adjacent markets, because the VARs also represent those products. So, we see that as a very attractive way for Rauland to expand because Rauland has their own VARs, they have optimized the processes, so there's a lot of synergies in these regional VARs. And then in addition to that, it provides closer customer contact and growth opportunities.","This particular business has grown low-double digits average compounded annually over the last five years. So, it's a very good grower. Low-double-digit EBITDAs and it's a nice opportunity for Rauland to expand their footprint and get closer to the customers. In less dense parts of the country, parts of the world, value-added resellers still make sense, but in some places it makes sense for Rauland to get closer to the customer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. And then on the organic 8%, it's very good obviously. I'm just wondering how you're measuring and gauging your progress on channel and new product introduction, execution into the addressable markets versus what's the cyclical lift here?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, with 8% organic growth and 12% organic growth in orders, we're certainly seeing some tangible success from our organic growth initiatives. Our focus on improving the front end of our business and continuing success from new product development efforts is driving market share gains. We've talked before about our growth kaizens and we're seeing very tangible benefits from specific actions and we're very optimistic with this effort and there's more to come.","But also the general economic improvements is certainly a key driver, and it's really difficult to distinguish between the two. But what I can say, we see no slowdown at all in the way we're looking at the world right now. We see strong growth across all of our product groups. We're growing in all geographies and we're feeling really good.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Sounds good. Thanks for the color.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel. You may begin.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Congrats on a very strong start to the year. Maybe we could talk about price on two spectra. One is just pricing overall over the next couple years because you're a firm that definitely just the nature of your business, the market structure, the value add should be garnering a pretty nice price benefit and particularly in the context of a price spread. So, would you expect price\/cost to be positive going forward for the full year and how should we think about just conceptually into 2019 because you're a company that historically, I think, has \u2013 part of your incremental margin lift has come from kind of structurally strong pricing. Could you talk about that a little bit?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. Great question, Rob. We expect to maintain a positive price inflation spread for the whole year, and we're talking about price inflation, we're just talking about inflation, we're not talking about productivity. That's just a pure total inflation number. And with our differentiated businesses and our closeness to the customer, we have a wide moat around our businesses. We can pass on the increased cost for inflation. So, we really expect a positive price inflation spread in the 20 to 30 bps range and we expect to hold that this year and there's no reason that that won't continue into 2019.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then maybe switching to price in terms on the acquisition front because clearly you've deployed some capital nicely. We would like to see probably more size and scale, but you can't have everything. But could you just talk about the state of your balance sheet, your firepower? And maybe just comment on \u2013 it's an interesting environment because you've probably seen a pullback in the public environment, but sellers' expectations still probably remain elevated here. Do you think you could reach kind of a bid\/ask issue in terms of people thinking of their companies as still very dear and being able to transact is going to be tough, or do you think you could shake some pretty big deals this year?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Those are all great questions, Rob. I mean the current M&A environment is very similar to what we've been experiencing the past couple of years. Pricing is elevated. There is plenty of cash-chasing deals. Now with the public market coming back again, that will eventually flow into the private market, but despite this market we've been successful in deploying our free cash flow on acquisitions.","I mean, since the \u2013 I mentioned in my prepared remarks, since the beginning of 2017 we acquired five companies and deployed nearly $835 million in capital and we're off to a great start in 2018. And our pipeline remains very active. You never know if something is going to transact in the short term, but I expect you'll be hearing from us again this year on M&A. Our strong pipeline along with the M&A processes gives me confidence.","And mentioned the larger deals or the size deals that we've been doing, we're going to execute our \u2013 we can do either one to execute our strategy. We've opened up our pipeline to slightly larger deals in the $200 million to $300 million revenue range, there will be deployments of capital of $1 billion, but we can keep doing the smaller deals and we can still get the earnings growth because of the way we structured the business and our acquisition process. So, I'm feeling really good about it.","And you mentioned finally our firepower, I think Bill mentioned our existing cash and credit facility was about \u2013 we have about $1.5 billion in firepower and most importantly, we'll generate another $865 million, $870 million in free cash flow in 2018. So, we really have the firepower. Our net debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.35. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA is 1.85. So, we could deploy 2-plus billion in capital this year, and really the strategy is not capital limited, it's finding those key acquisitions that we can add value to, so we can maintain a return on invested capital of 10% in year three. That's the key hurdle for us.","That gives you the return on total capital for the whole business, and AMETEK has extremely strong return on total capital for an acquisitive company, and we maintain that discipline and that discipline is the limiter right now. But we are clearly looking at things and our pipeline's full, and we'll be clear to select the deals that we can make the most \u2013 that we can approve the most, but I think the \u2013 I'm very optimistic about what I see in our pipeline right now.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","If I could sneak one more in, just amortization, any update on looking on that and studying that, whether you want to make a move to cash earnings.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Our EBITDA was a record $306 million this quarter. It's 26% of sales, so a very good number. Our D&A was about $49 million, and as I said in our last call, that we looked at that at the beginning of the year and we decided not to do it. And we'll look at it again next year. But that's the decision we made for 2018.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi guys, good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hi, Allison.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, could you talk a little bit about conversations with customers broadly across the group. I know you said the outlook's pretty strong, but are there any areas where customers are maybe becoming more cautious or even maybe accelerating the orders ahead of the likely price increases? Any thoughts there.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","It's pretty much bullish across our whole portfolio. We were in Asia this quarter, the executive office went for our annual regional review in Asia, and that region was incredibly bullish, and we're seeing strength in the U.S., continuing strength in Europe, and all of our product groups are very positive. We're even seeing some of the longer cycle elements of our portfolio, like the mid and downstream oil and gas, the military parts of our business, they're very bullish about bigger projects breaking later in the year and into 2019. So, our automation businesses are firing on all cylinders. So, we're not seeing any slowdown and we feel really good about the year. We feel really good about how the year's playing out.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And then just not to beat the sort of price inflation issue up a little bit, but are there any specific businesses, could you remind us, that are maybe more susceptible to the inflation and your thoughts on passing that through in terms of pricing?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, I think we've had a strategy for a long period of time to acquire businesses that are really leaders in niche markets and that puts us in a position \u2013 we're providing more value, these are markets that are sticky customer relationships. And we're providing a lot of value to these customers and we get in situations like this, we view it as only fair that we can pass those prices on to customers. So, we feel really good about our portfolio and we feel really good about achieving price out of inflation in 2018 and 2019.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Like to follow that train of thought on customer dialogue and do you have any color on whether tax reform and CapEx incentives are playing through in any of the demand that you're seeing.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Deane, we were seeing it. We saw an uptick in our business in 2017 in the second half and that was pretty measurable. But into 2018, we have not seen an incremental increase from tax reform. It's just remained strong. So, I can't say that we've seen an increase specifically tied to tax reform and with specific customers with regard to tax reform. It's just really good and it's staying that way.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just other color on the price\/cost dynamic. You didn't mention tariffs, do you feel as though that's any impact including what could be on the horizon here?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, it's a great question, Deane. We do not import much steel and aluminum, so really a minimal impact from that. We are watching the entire situation closely as you can imagine, including secondary impacts. We have very good supply chain capability and flexibility and we're doing some planning on the supply chain side, if we need to react quickly.","And the same point that goes to pricing, we're leaders in niche markets and we have sticky customer relationships and have the ability to pass on cost increases to customers. So, we're examining numerous countermeasures, just something be enacted. Right now we don't see a measurable impact to our business, but it's uncertain and we're closely monitoring it.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And just last question for me, can you \u2013 and were there any growth investments in the quarter that you would highlight along either digital marketing or sales force investments, anything along those lines?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, it's all the above. We're investing about $75 million this year in growth investments and heavy investments in digital marketing, heavy investments in a lot of selling tools and also heavy investments in product development. So, we're feeling really good about the investments. We think we're getting a great return and we're optimistic about that in the future.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Do you have a sense of how much in this quarter and would that be spread across the segments? Is there any of that in corporate?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Most of that is in the segments and it's spread out through the year.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey from Vertical Research. You may begin.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning, all.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, just wanted to come back to EMG and specifically on incremental margins. Given strong volume, I would have thought incrementals would have been a little bit better in quarter and I realize FX dropped \u2013 the drop-through there (36:28) incrementals, but anything else in terms of mix or excess cost, I mean deliveries, price\/cost that impacted you here in the quarter within EMG?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Brett, EMG had a great quarter. I mean, sequentially, the margins were up 170 basis points and on a core basis, they were up 30 bps. So, we're pretty pleased with the performance.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And I guess how should we think about incremental margins within EMG for the balance of the year?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, I think we've guided to the incrementals in the low-30s, 35% and I think in general, the Instruments side of our business has little bit higher incrementals, so I would say in the 35% to 40% range, and EMG is a little bit lower in the 25% to 30% range.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. And then just shifting back to your comment on long cycle, I guess in the context of visibility, obviously you've been deploying a lot on deals here. If you were look at the pro forma construct of the portfolio, including some of these recent deals, how would you size what you would characterize as longer cycle (37:52) a percent of the total portfolio today?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","I would characterize the bulk of the portfolio in mid and longer cycle businesses. We don't have many short cycle businesses, but the vast majority of the portfolio is in mid and longer cycle businesses.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then maybe just one more, in terms of recent acquisitions, so FMH, Arizona, SoundCom, how are we thinking about incremental earnings accretion as we look into 2019 and some of the (38:30) starts to abate? Any framework you can list there?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, we haven't done the work for 2019 yet, but I can tell you that in our plan for 2018, we saw a net benefit of M&A of about $0.06.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. Great quarter, guys. Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. You may begin.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Richard.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Could you just speak for a minute, Dave, perhaps to the order strength? I think you've mentioned core orders were plus 12%. Could you just talk to maybe a couple end markets that might be driving order growth above that kind of average core number? And I'm thinking specifically to some of the more cyclical, maybe speak to oil and gas.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And then also on the aerospace side, I mean, are you seeing outsized order growth there, maybe regional biz jet? Or maybe just a little color around the 12% number.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure. I mean, regarding oil and gas, in the first quarter, our sales were up low-double digits and orders outpaced that a bit. And in terms of the aerospace business, we saw very strong performance in our commercial business. So, it was up low-double digits in the first quarter, both OE and aftermarket. And also the military business stands out. There was a very strong orders performance in military, and our automation business stands out. There was very strong orders in automation and across all regions of the globe, so it was a really good quarter from the viewpoint of orders.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Does your oil and gas \u2013 given how the first quarter started out, I think there was an expectation for oil and gas to be up kind of mid-single digits this year, kind of led by, I think it was upstream. Does that number drift higher now with your comments around downstream orders, and also maybe how the first quarter shook out?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, the first quarter performance, our upstream business was up, the upstream is only 25% of our oil and gas presence, and that's about a $280 million exposure. But it was up very strongly. It was up about 30% in the first quarter and the mid\/downstream was up in the mid high-single-digit range. So, we haven't changed the year guidance yet for that. It's still mid-single digits for the year, but what we're seeing now is the planning work for some orders in the second half of the year that'll ship in 2019 for the bigger projects in the mid and downstream markets.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Understood. And then just the last question, around the acquisition SoundCom, I'm a little bit curious, is the service element of Rauland-Borg's business \u2013 does the service element flow through the VARs? In other words, there's a big service component to SoundCom Systems, and hence the advantage of owning a few of the VARs in key markets, does that bring the recurring revenue stream to Rauland?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","It does bring some. I mean, the recurring revenue stream is from spare parts, from software upgrades, and also from the direct service of the client. So, the acquisitions of the VARs does augment the recurring revenue business for Rauland.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Understood. Thank you. And great start to the year.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. You may begin.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Curious on components for your parts, you're not really seeing it in the inventory levels you have on your balance sheet, but are you seeing a little tightness in that market and there's been some commentary about people trying to buy ahead of that and kind of keep some safety stock and increase the levels of that. Are you seeing that in the market or are you doing some of that yourself?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","We're not doing much of it, but there is some tightness. We're seeing some tightness in the electronic supply chain and we're also seeing some increased inflationary cost in the transportation that we talked about last quarter, but there is some tightness out there, but we're managing through it and we have excellent supply chain capability, but there is some tightness.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then your businesses exposed on the specialty metals side, have they been tracking pretty closely with price movements in those markets? And is that kind of a consistent \u2013 something that's been progressing throughout the quarter and like kind of at high run rates right now versus maybe the beginning of the quarter?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. That business, you recall the way we have that business structured is we pass the material prices on to the customer. And we're adding value to the materials.

In the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. We were also very active on the acquisition front during the quarter, acquiring a number of highly strategic businesses.","For the full year, we established records for essentially all key financial metrics, including sales, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. Sales were up 8% for the year; operating income was up 9%; operating margins expanded 30 basis points to 22.7%; and diluted earnings per share ended at $2.10, a 12% increase over 2012's diluted earnings per share.","Focusing on the fourth quarter, sales increased 12% to $942.5 million. Organic growth was very strong, up 7% on broad-based strength across most of our businesses, while acquisitions added 4%, and currency added 1%.","Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 11% to $210.5 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was 22.3% compared to 22.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Net income was up 13% to $135.7 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.55 were up 12% over last year's fourth quarter. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records.","Operating cash flow was excellent. It was $210 million for the fourth quarter and $661 million for the year, both up 8%. Free cash flow was very strong at 135% of net income in the fourth quarter and 116% of net income for the full year.","Working capital management was outstanding at 16.7% of sales in the quarter. This represents a record level.","Orders in the quarter were $912 million, up 3% organically on an adjusted basis.","Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a strong fourth quarter and an excellent year. For the quarter, sales were up 15% to $566.9 million on broad-based strength across our Process businesses, plus the contributions from the acquisitions of Controls Southeast, Creaform and Powervar. Internal growth was strong, up 7%, while acquisitions added 7% and foreign currency added 1%.","EIG's operating income increased 13% to $151.9 million, and operating margins were 26.8%. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions and the additional growth investments made in the quarter, EIG's operating margins were 27.5%, up 20 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter.","The Electromechanical Group also had a very good quarter. Sales were up 8% to $375.6 million on strong growth across all of our differentiated businesses as well as excellent growth in our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business. Organic sales were up 7%, and foreign currency added 1%.","EMG's operating income increased 8% to $70.5 million, and operating margins were 18.8% in the quarter.","Now turning to our 4 growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and strategic acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions.","We had a very active quarter with the acquisitions of Creaform and Powervar. In addition, we acquired Teseq in early January. Combined, we deployed approximately $340 million on these acquisitions and acquired approximately $175 million in revenue. For the full year, including Teseq, we acquired 4 businesses, deployed approximately $500 million in capital and acquired $225 million in revenue.","I will provide some highlights of Powervar and Teseq. Powervar and Teseq are both excellent acquisitions for AMETEK. Their products, technologies and markets are highly complementary with our existing power businesses. Equally important, these acquisitions expand the size and capabilities of our Power business. As I have highlighted in the past, we view our Power business as a very attractive platform from which we can grow significantly, both internally and through strategic acquisitions like Powervar and Teseq.","With these 2 acquisitions, our Power business now totals approximately $500 million in sales. Our businesses have market-leading positions in power quality instruments for power generation and transmission and distribution, back-up power systems for highly ruggedized environments and test and measurement power solutions for a range of test applications. We remain very excited about the opportunities within our Power business.","Powervar is a leading provider of power management and UPS systems used in medical, life sciences, industrial and retail applications. They provide highly engineered and customized power conditioning and UPS products designed to deliver reliable, high-quality power to critical applications. Powervar's strong presence in medical and life sciences provides our Power business with excellent new growth opportunities in these attractive market segments. Additionally, their products and technologies are highly complementary with our existing power quality and UPS systems. Powervar was privately held and has annual sales of approximately $70 million. The business is headquartered in Waukegan, Illinois.","Teseq is a leading manufacturer of electrical test systems and instruments for use in electromagnetic compatibility emissions and immunity testing. Products include a broad line of conducted and radiated EMC compliance testing systems and RF amplifiers used for a wide range of industries, including aerospace and automotive electronics, medical equipment, telecommunications and transportation. Teseq is a good addition to our electrical test and measurement business. Their products and markets are complementary with our EM Test business, which we acquired in 2011. In addition, Teseq provides us with opportunities for accelerating product innovation and market expansion worldwide. Teseq was privately held with annual sales of about $53 million, and the business is headquartered in Luterbach, Switzerland and has additional facilities in the U.K., Germany and the U.S.","Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us during 2014 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our pipeline of deals is excellent, our balance sheet is strong and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy.","Now turning to global and market expansion. Global and market expansion continues to be an important driver for AMETEK's growth. In the fourth quarter, international sales represented a record 57% of our total sales. The strong performance was driven by excellent organic growth in our international markets and the benefits from recent acquisitions. Sales growth in the BRIC regions was also very strong, up 11% organically in the quarter. These results also reflect the continued investments we are making to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive growth opportunities in these international markets.","In the fourth quarter, AMETEK's Micro-Poise Measurement Systems business, which we acquired in 2012, secured a number of large orders for their Modular Tire Measurement Systems within the BRIC regions. Overall, orders for Micro-Poise in the BRIC regions were up over 50% in the quarter with $7 million worth of orders in China and India for these modular measurement systems. Micro-Poise's tire measurement systems combine uniformity, balance and geometry measurement capability in a single machine. We have seen strong demand in emerging markets for these systems as a result of ongoing expansion of tire manufacturing capacity in these markets. In addition, we have made a number of investments and improvements in the global sales, service and distribution structure within Micro-Poise since the time of acquisition.","Moving on to our third strategy, new product development remains key to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently invested in RD&E. In 2013, we spent $179 million, which was up 16% from 2012. In 2014, we expect to spend approximately $200 million, a 12% increase over 2013.","We're excited about some recent new product introductions.

The instrument incorporates a new twin-lamp operating technology that allows it to achieve higher irradiance levels that can significantly reduce test times. It also utilizes a new technology for extending the service life of the instrument's xenon lamps, increasing the instrument's uptime and reducing lamp's operating cost by more than 30%.","From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 21% of sales in the quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers.","Lastly, I will touch on operational excellence. We continue to see tremendous results from our various operational excellence initiatives. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continual operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the numerous operational excellence tools we have put in place in our company.","Key tenets of our operational excellence activities include Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, Design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, moving our production to low-cost locales and value engineering.","Through our global sourcing and strategic procurement activities, we recognized $16 million in savings in the fourth quarter and $62 million in savings for all of 2013. Overall, we realized approximately $100 million in total cost savings in 2013 through our various operational excellence initiatives. For 2014, we expect approximately $90 million in total cost savings through our operational excellence initiatives, including $60 million in savings through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives.","Turning to the outlook now for 2014. We expect our businesses overall to show solid growth during 2014 with balanced organic growth across both operating groups. We anticipate 2014 revenue to be up high single digits on a percentage basis from 2013. Organic growth is expected to be up 2% to 4% for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2014 are expected to be in a range of $2.30 to $2.35 per diluted share, up 10% to 12% over 2013, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, our operational initiatives and the benefit of contributions from recent acquisitions.","First quarter 2014 sales are expected to be up high single digits from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.55 to $0.57 per diluted share, up 8% to 12% over last year's first quarter. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2014.","So in summary, our overall business has performed very well in the fourth quarter and in 2013, producing records for essentially all key financial metrics. Although the macroeconomic conditions created a more challenging environment in 2013 than we expected, our team did an excellent job, and we were able to deliver exceptional operating results through a focus on executing our 4 growth strategies.","We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth. We look forward to another successful year in 2014.","Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions.","Robert R. Mandos","Thank you, Frank.","As Frank noted, we had an excellent fourth quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details.","In the quarter, core growth in selling expenses was in line with core growth in sales. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales, in line with last year's fourth quarter.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.2%, down from last year's fourth quarter rate of 29.8%. The full year tax rate was 28.7% versus last year's rate of 30.7%. We are very pleased with the success of our ongoing international and state tax planning initiatives on our fourth quarter and full year rates reflect the positive impact of these initiatives. As a result, for 2014, we estimate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.","On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 16.7% of sales in the fourth quarter. This record low level of working capital positioned AMETEK as one of the top performers in our peer group and is a direct reflection of the tremendous strides our business units have taken in driving towards operating excellence. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority.","Capital spending was $26 million for the quarter and $63 million for the full year. Full year 2013 capital expenditures were 1.8% of sales. 2014 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $32 million for the quarter and $119 million for the full year. 2014 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $134 million.","Our cash flow was excellent in the quarter and for the full year. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and full year were records. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $210 million, up 8% over last year's fourth quarter. Full year operating cash flow was $661 million, also up 8%. Free cash flow was excellent at $183 million in the quarter, representing 135% of net income. For the full year, free cash flow was $597 million, approximately 116% of net income, continuing our strong free cash flow generation. Our cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy, where we expended approximately $414 million on transactions in 2013.","Total debt was $1.42 billion at December 31, down $39 million from 2012 year end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $295 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at December 31 of 26%, down from 34% at the end of 2012.","At December 31, we had approximately $880 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we acquired Teseq. Capital deployed on this acquisition was approximately $90 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.","In the fourth quarter, we extended the term of our $700 million revolving credit facility back to its original 5-year period. Our revolver now extends until December of 2018. All other terms of the revolving credit facility remain unchanged.","In summary, we had an outstanding 2013, establishing records for essentially all the key financial metrics. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.","Frank S. Hermance","Great. Thanks, Bob. We'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt McConnell of Citi Research.","Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So if I can start with incrementals. They were a bit below trend. I know there might be mix issues with Floorcare being stronger and, obviously, a couple of deals recently. But were there any other drags that are worth calling out? And maybe, could you quantify the impact of Floorcare and the acquisitions?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, if you look at the impact, we started in EIG, there was definitely an impact from the acquisitions because that's where we did those deals. And also, we made incremental growth investments there, and they were on the order of $3 million there. And then in terms of EMG, there was a fairly significant mix shift. Floorcare and Specialty Motors was actually up organically mid-teens. So very, very strong performance in the quarter. And although the differentiated part of EMG continued to be strong, there was that mix shift, and that caused margins to be flat where they probably would have been up 20 to 30 basis points.","Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And what's your expectation for margin expansion in the 2014 guidance? And then, maybe my final question would be did you quantify the growth investments that you anticipate for 2014?","Frank S. Hermance","Sure. In terms of margin performance, that's included in our guidance. We are assuming about 20 to 30 basis points of margin enhancement on the operating income line. In terms of the growth investments that we are putting into the business in 2014, it's approximately $40 million. And those growth investments are going to go into continued expansion of our sales, service and distribution channels, largely international locations but not solely. And also, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're going to increase our RD&E spending from roughly $179 million up to just around $200 million, which is a 12% increase in RD&E. So we are definitely going to continue to make investments in the growth of the business organically, and then, obviously, we'll use our free cash flow to deploy on acquisitions.","Operator","And our next question comes from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just going on Matt's question, can you -- with the margin expansion, that 20 to 30 basis points, can you quantify maybe what that acquisition impact is and what you've just done?","Frank S. Hermance","I don't actually have a number to exactly what it would be, but roughly on the order of 30 basis points.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just touching on emerging markets. It sounds like select businesses are -- in your BRIC regions are getting some orders. But how are you thinking about that for '14? Obviously, there's been a lot of noise in news about challenges over there.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, it's actually amazing. We were very delighted in the quarter when we looked at our international businesses, actually, believe it or not, both in Europe and in Asia. In Asia, the organic growth was up about 25%, in Asia. So a truly outstanding quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, in the BRIC countries, it's up about 11%. And as we're looking into 2014, in the BRIC regions, we're assuming a low double-digit type of growth rate. Obviously, that growth rate is higher than the intrinsic growth in those markets and is a direct reflection of the investments that we have been putting in that part of the world and the fact that our shares, in particular in BRIC and, to even a larger extent, throughout Asia, are a bit less than in other parts of the world. So we're able to gain a reasonable share. So a very, very good quarter. And we're feeling fairly good about next year in those regions. As I mentioned, surprisingly, Europe was strong for us. It was up actually in the double digits organically. And it was fairly broad based, you may recall in some of our previous calls where I talked about it being driven by aerospace and oil and gas. Now they were still very strong, but we also saw reasonable strength in many of our businesses, actually, throughout most of the Process businesses and also some in our Power segment. So things feel a little bit better in Europe, and that's a good thing.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baliotti of Janney Capital Markets.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Frank, I was wondering maybe for -- now that you've clearly moved into the large cap arena and there may be more people that are attracted to the company, I was just wondering if you could -- you've done a lot of deals over the years, and maybe if we can just take a look at the -- or just talk about the ones you've done sort of the last 12 to 14 months. Could you kind of -- if you want to sort of summarize how these complement the growth strategy? I know you touched on Powervar and Teseq. But along those lines, maybe touch on what kind of operators that you've been developing over the years to run these platforms?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, you're hitting on a very, very key point, John. And that is the key of our strategy is to basically have first-class operating managers that can not only identify acquisitions but be able to accurately predict and execute what synergies we can get from the deals that we acquire. And our operating teams have just done an incredible job of taking the businesses that we've acquired over the time frame you're talking about or even over a longer time period and being able to get really good synergies, both on the cost side as well as the distribution and growth side. And what we have done is put in place a methodology so that we are continually growing the talent and doing cross-training in our businesses so that the talent continues to grow and can get involved in more and more deals as the company gets bigger. I often joke inside the company that if I go back 15 years ago when I first became CEO, I was basically doing all the deals. And now, the teams do the deals. They just do a great job, and they know how to do them and they know how to get them done. Talking about some of the other deals that I didn't specifically highlight in my talk, the deal before Powervar and Teseq was Creaform. Creaform, just a super deal. Very high-technology company basically involved in ultra-precision mobile measurement capability. This company is located in Quebec. The management team has come in to AMETEK. And I'm sure some of them are listening, and I will compliment them. They've done an excellent job getting used to our operating philosophies. And the business is growing, and it's exceeding the model that we've put in place for that business. The deal before that was Controls Southeast. That particular deal was an augmentation of our O'Brien deal, which we did a couple of years, again -- or maybe 1 year before that, which is involved in sort of the aftermarket part of our Process businesses. So all of these deals were in an area that we know something about them, it's not like we're doing deals that are outside of our knowledge base, so that we take very little risk from the market viewpoint when we do the deals, and then we can leverage those deals with our operating capabilities.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yet it seems -- I know it's relatively small compared to the other ones, but it's -- Creaform seems like a very interesting acquisition. And given your -- what you've been able to do with some of your other businesses that are more traditional and being able to grow them, it should be interesting to see how you leverage that acquisition.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, we see that definitely as a high-growth type of business for us. As I mentioned, very strong management team, and we're just going to support them in growing that business because we think it's got phenomenal opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Frank, can you disclose what orders in backlog look like and then what organically you saw from an incoming order rate standpoint?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. Orders overall were $912 million. Correct me, guys. I'm just doing it from memory. They were actually down a bit. They were down about 5%. However, we had some very large orders last year that were onetime orders. So when we normalized those orders and when you look at that to your organic growth on orders, it was up about 3%. So in the quarter, 3% organic growth on orders, 7% organic growth on sales.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then you mentioned targeting $90 million worth of cost reductions, $60 million from sourcing. One, can you sort of talk about where you're getting the other $30 million? And then this $90 million, if we were to subtract out the incremental investments you're making in growth, in R&D and what you typically incur from just a inflationary standpoint, is there still some net cost reduction left over?","Frank S. Hermance","Oh, yes, definitely. I mean, probably the best metrics that I can give you is that you also have to include pricing in this equation. And the metrics that we look at are that basically, in the budget for 2014, we have about 1.5% to 2% in terms of price, and we believe that the inflation that's going through the P&L is about a little bit less than 1%. So there's definitely incremental amount that is there. And then, as you indicated, the $90 million, there's about $60 million which is part of the material side of the business. But there's another $30 million -- and that is just the normal operational excellence initiatives, and it's really a large number of items, things that -- actually, I mentioned some of them in my opening talk. Value engineering is becoming more important to us. There's a movement of production to low-cost locales. We're going to move and have about $500 million of volume in our low-cost facilities in 2014, which is up from about $450 million in 2013. There's the normal types of synergies that we're going to get from the deals that I just talked about in answer to John's questions. There's international distribution consolidation that we are continuing to do not only with recent acquisitions but deals we did a number of years ago. So it's -- this is really a continual process for us. So when you roll all of that up, it's basically definitely we're getting sizable leverage. And it's obviously a balance between the growth investments, which are going to be the $40 million, the cost reductions, inflation and pricing that allows us to get the kind of earnings performance that we're talking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So, Frank, you're rolling in about 4 deals now at EIG. I'm wondering if you could comment on what are the strains and gating factors on organizational capacity to absorb those. And also, how is EIG's pipeline looking?","Frank S. Hermance","In terms of any gates, the biggest issue is that as we're all aware, the pricing on some deals has definitely gone up. So we are prioritizing our deals to where the multiples we're paying are very reasonable so that when we bring the deals in and put our improvements in the deals, the returns are higher than our -- obviously our cost of capital. So that's the sort of the driver there. In terms of the deal backlog, it's quite good. We are working on other deals as we speak. It would not surprise me if you heard from us in a relative short future about another deal that we're going to close. And I think our ability to both source deals and also get them closed is a core competency of this company. And as I mentioned before, we are continually growing the talent so that we have the capacity to do deals. Right now, we believe we can do 10 to 12 deals a year. That's the infrastructure that we've put in place. We think it's the capability that we have intrinsic in the organization, and that essentially assumes we would not do 2 deals within a same -- the same subsegment of our business. Because then, the risk profile goes up. So we will spread them. Even if it's in the same, like for instance Power, they will be done in different parts of the Power business so that in essence, we're not increasing our risk as we bring those deals in.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then on the organic growth outlook of 2% to 4%, I think your price approach is 2%. Sounds like BRIC's going to give you 1 point. You just did 7, and the comps don't get tougher for several quarters. So I'm wondering if maybe that's a little conservative or just to call that 1 quarter is too early to call a trend.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, 1 quarter is definitely too early to call a trend. And we're just taking a cautious outlook going into the year, and, hopefully, we'll be able to report better numbers as we go through the year. But basically, that 2% to 4% is what we have rolled up in our guidance.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott Graham of Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about this $90 million maybe in a little bit of different way it was asked previously. I don't know if you're counting this differently because I remember you were saying at some point in the last 2 years that $60 million was the baseline target. And when things were -- the economy was better, that was the number; and when the economy was weaker, you pushed that number up. Or -- did you at that point not include acquisition cost takeout? Or is this $90 million just a big acceleration off of some of the value engineering [ph] and other things you talked about?","Frank S. Hermance","Now basically, Scott, we have included acquisitions continually in terms of providing that metric. I think the key answer to your question is that the company has just gotten larger so that there are more opportunities to take cost out. And we view this cost journey as a never-ending kind of activity that we expect our businesses every year, independent of where they are on the maturity curve, to be looking at cost improvements in their business. And the number is definitely larger, but I think if you stood it up aside the growth of the business, it's not that much different than what it has been historically on a percentage basis.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's fair. My next question is regarding the EIG margin. Could you tell us maybe specifically what the acquisition dilution to the margin was in the quarter and whether there were purchase accounting charges within that?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, the full dilution of the margin was on the order -- you've got it there, Kevin? What...","Kevin C. Coleman","Yes. It was around -- it was $50 million for -- 50 basis points for EIG.","Frank S. Hermance","50 basis points for EIG.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And were there purchase accountings in there?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes.","Robert R. Mandos","Yes.","Kevin C. Coleman","Yes.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess my last question would be the one that would -- somebody always asks, Frank. If you don't mind going through the divisional, it would be helpful.","Frank S. Hermance","Sure, Scott. I'd be glad to do that. So I'll start with the EIG. I don't think there's any real surprises here. For EIG aerospace, we had a very strong year. Sales were up mid-single digits, and that was driven by strength in commercial and our business in regional jet business. In the fourth quarter, EIG aerospace orders were up high single digits, and that, obviously, reflects the continued growth in commercial OEM build rates and also our success in winning content on new platforms. Looking to 2014, we expect continued solid growth for our EIG aerospace businesses. And again, that's based on the trends in the OEM build rates. Boeing and Airbus, the combination of those 2, are predicting they're going to be up about 6% in terms of deliveries. So that will obviously have an impact on our business. And we also expect solid growth in business in regional jets, but not so much from the market dynamics there as from the fact that we have won sizable content on a number of the newer aircraft. So when we sum all of that up for 2014, we're expecting organic growth in EIG aerospace to be up in that mid-single-digit arena. Moving to our Process businesses, the Process businesses had a super fourth quarter and also for the full year with really growth across most of our businesses. In the fourth quarter, overall sales were up high teens on a percentage basis with organic sales up high single digits. The core growth was broad based with particular strength in our Measurement and Calibration Technology and Advanced Measurement Technology divisions. And overall growth was obviously driven also by the contributions from the Controls Southeast and Creaform acquisitions. And for 2014, we expect our Process businesses to grow high single digits overall with organic growth of low to mid-single digits. And in response to one of the other questions, there might be a bit of conservatism in that organic growth rate for 2014. And we do expect balanced growth across most of our Process businesses in 2014. And then the last part of EIG is Power and Industrial. They had a solid fourth quarter with overall sales up high single digits. Growth was driven by mid-single-digit organic growth as well as the contribution from the acquisition of Powervar, which we discussed. And we view Power as a highly attractive growth area for us. With the acquisition of Powervar and Teseq, our overall Power business now is about $500 million in sales. And as a result of the acquisitions in 2014, we expect overall sales for Power and Industrial to be up over 30%. So very strong overall sales. And we're predicting organic growth to be up low to mid-single digits. So if you sum those 3 parts of EIG for all of 2014, we're estimating EIG total sales will be up low teens on a percentage basis with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. Moving to the other part of the company, in EMG, our differentiated EMG businesses had a strong fourth quarter. Sales were up mid-single digits in the quarter, really driven by broad-based strength, again, across most of the businesses in this subsegment. And for 2014, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up low to mid-single digits. And the last part of our company, Floorcare and Specialty Motors, they just had a great fourth quarter and a great year. Sales were up mid-teens organically in the quarter, as I mentioned in response to one of the questions. And also, they were up very strong for the entire year, up -- I guess it was high single digits. So they had very, very good growth. And for 2014, we expect sales for this business -- we're saying up low single digits, and that's really based on a very high strength that we had in 2013. So if you sum those 2 for EMG, we're expecting overall growth of low to mid-single digits for EMG if you sum those 2 parts of the company. And that gets back to my overall guidance of the company being up high single digits overall with organic growth up about 2% to 4%, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Mason of Baird.","Robert W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Frank, I want to see if you could just circle back to aerospace real quick. The military portion of aerospace, I was just curious how that finished the year and what the planning assumptions embedded in aerospace are for military.","Frank S. Hermance","Excellent question. It's -- we had just a phenomenal quarter in the military segment. We're actually up mid-single digits organically for that part of the business. It was driven by the international part of our military segment, not the U.S. piece. But even the U.S. piece was not down sizably. So very strong performance. And what's included in my guidance in 2014 is for that business to be roughly flat. And that's the way we went into this year, assuming it was flat. Actually, I think we assumed it was going to be down a bit, and it turned out to be even better than that. So we're feeling pretty good in that this is not going to be a major drain on the company.","Robert W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, very good. And back to your geographic comment. I know you commented on the outlook for the BRIC regions. I was just going to see if you could flesh out the geographic outlook for '14 for the other major regions.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, we're saying basically the U.S. piece is going to be flattish. Europe, we think, is going to be up a little bit, maybe a little bit different than some of the large macro trends. And obviously, we think Asia is going to be the strongest part of this. And I'm speaking from an organic basis.","Robert W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Is there any particular portion of the business you'd call out in the U.S. that is working against you in '14?","Frank S. Hermance","Well, I would say, as you heard from -- what I just went over with Scott, the weakest piece we're going to say is the Floorcare and Specialty Motors part of the business, where we're saying it's only going to be up a low single digits. So that's probably the weakest. But it's also coming off a very, very strong year. So I think we're going to be back to a more normal trend with the Floorcare and Specialty Motors business than what we saw throughout all of 2013. But aside from that, the growth is fairly balanced in our budget. I look at our Process businesses, and you heard us speak throughout 2013 a lot about the oil and gas part of that business. And what's happening there is that with CapEx not sort of as strong as it has been in the oil and gas part of the business, that growth is coming down a little bit. But countering that, our other Process businesses are doing extremely well. So it's a much more balanced picture of what we saw in the fourth quarter and what we expect to see going into next year.","Operator","Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time.

Sales in the quarter were up 7% to $882.9 million, organic sales declined 2%, while acquisitions added 9% and currency was flat.","Operating income for the first quarter increased 8% to $197.2 million from $182.8 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our Operational Excellence activities. Operating income margin in the quarter was 22.3%, a 20 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2012. Net income was up 14% to $125 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.51 were up 13% over last year's first quarter.","Included in our first quarter 2013 results are approximately $0.01 per diluted share in realignment cost and approximately $0.01 per diluted share in cost related to the performance-based accelerated vesting of restricted stock.","As a result of the continued weak global environment, we determined it was prudent to take additional cost reduction actions in the first half of the year; the first quarter charge reflects these actions. We expect to see the majority of the benefits from these actions in the second half of 2013. The performance-based vesting occurred as a result of the stock price doubling in less than 3 years, reflecting the significant value created for AMETEK shareholders.","If we adjust the earnings for both of these changes, the first quarter 2013 earnings would have been $0.53 per diluted share, up 18% over the same period last year.","Orders in the first quarter were $878 million, up 2% overall from the prior year on a difficult comparison. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.","Cash flow was excellent. Operating cash flow was $157 million, up 11% over last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was $146 million or 117% of net income.","Working capital management was excellent. Operating working capital was 17.6% of sales.","Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very solid first quarter. Sales were up 3% to $484.5 million, on strength in our longer cycle Aerospace and oil and gas businesses, plus the contributions from the Micro-Poise acquisition. Organic sales were down 2%, while currency was flat.","EIG's operating income increased 7% to $131.7 million, and operating margins were very strong at 27.2%, up 100 basis points over last year's first quarter.","The Electromechanical Group also had a solid quarter. Sales were up 11% to a record $398.4 million, on strength in our third-party Aerospace MRO business and the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition. Organic sales were down 3%, acquisitions added 14% and foreign currency was flat.","EMG's operating income increased 10% to $78 million, and operating margins were 19.6%. Excluding the impact of the Dunkermotoren acquisition, EMG's operating margins would have been 20.3%, up 50 basis points over the first quarter of 2012.","Focusing now on our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and acquisitions. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. Operational Excellence has many facets within our company, including lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurements and the movement of production to low-cost locales.","At the beginning of the year, we targeted $85 million in total cost savings through our various Operational Excellence initiatives. As a result of our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives to date and the additional cost reduction actions we are taking, we are now targeting $95 million of cost savings in 2013.","In the first quarter, our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives recognized approximately $14 million in savings, exceeding our target for the quarter. Given the continued strong effort by our management teams and employees in this area, we now expect approximately $54 million in savings for all of 2013, up from the $50 million we targeted at the beginning of the year.","Moving to our second strategy. Global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK's growth. In the first quarter of 2013, international sales represented 55% of our total sales. This was up from 51% of sales in the first quarter of 2012 and represents our highest-ever percentage of international sales. The increase in international sales percentage was driven by strong growth in our European commercial and third-party MRO Aerospace businesses and the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition.","Overall, sales growth in the BRICS regions in the first quarter was very strong, up 18% over last year's first quarter, with especially strong growth in China. We continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprints in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities.","Our Power Instruments business has expanded its international growth opportunities with the development of transient power recorders that are compliant with IEC communications standards for electric substation automation equipment. Along with these IEC-compliant devices, we've increased our direct sales representation and entered into a number of strategic alliances to further extend our international market reach.","In the first quarter, Power Instruments successfully secured a number of new wins worth approximately $3.5 million for their transient recorders in the Middle East. Additional opportunities are expected given our increased investments in that region.","Moving to our third strategy. New product development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We've consistently invested in RD&E. In 2013, we expect to spend $173 million, a 12% increase over 2012. We're excited about some recent new product introductions driven by our RD&E efforts.","SPECTROSCOUT, the latest ED-XRF elemental analyzer from SPECTRO Analytical Instruments, was officially unveiled in March at the Pittcon Conference. This compact portable instrument represents a major step forward for end users. The versatile instrument is able to perform rapid laboratory-class elemental analysis in the field or at remote locations. The SPECTROSCOUT is light enough to be carried and yet has as much analytical power as a top-grade benchtop laboratory analyzer. It's the ideal tool for environmental and geological field analysis and for highly accurate on-site precious metal analysis.","AMETEK's Process Instrument business recently introduced the Thermox WDG-V Combustion Analyzer for measuring oxygen, combustibles and methane levels in flue gas. This product is the fifth-generation combustion efficiency gas analyzer from Thermox, building upon a long history of over 30,000 products installed in the field. It offers a reliable cost-effective solution for lowering NOx, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide emissions; reducing excess oxygen; and improving operating efficiency for customers in refineries, power plants and chemical plants. Along with maximizing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions, the WDG-V Combustion Analyzer is designed to play an increasingly important role in plant control and safety, while reducing the risk of an uncontrolled combustion event.","From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 22% of sales in the first quarter, up from 19% the prior year, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers.","On our fourth strategy of acquisitions, AMETEK had a very strong year of acquisitions in 2012, deploying nearly $750 million in capital and acquiring 7 businesses with approximately $400 billion in annual revenue. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2013, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value.","We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our backlog of deals remains excellent, our balance sheet is strong and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy.","Turning to the outlook now for the remainder of 2013. We anticipate 2013 revenue to be up high single digits on a percentage basis from 2012. Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. We expect stronger organic growth in the second half of the year.","Earnings for 2013 are expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.12 per diluted share, up 11% to 13% over 2012. We raise the low end of the guidance range we provided last quarter.","Second quarter 2013 sales are expected to be up mid to high single digits from last year's second quarter, with organic growth flat to up low single digits, reflecting the existing soft demand environment. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.51 to $0.52 per diluted share, up 9% to 11% over last year's second quarter.","So in summary, we delivered strong results in the quarter and are well positioned for the remainder of 2013. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our excellent backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven Operational Excellence capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2013.","I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous effort and contributions from all of our management teams and employees, to thank them for their hard work and dedication. Our success has been and will continue to be a direct result of their efforts.","Bob Mandos will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bob?","Robert R. Mandos","Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a solid first quarter, with very strong operating performance. I will provide some further details.","In the quarter, total selling expenses were up less than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost containment. General and administrative expenses were 1.4% of sales, slightly above last year's first quarter level of 1.3% of sales, driven by the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in this year's first quarter.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.1%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 31.9%. As we had expected, the lower tax rate in the quarter was a result of the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, as well as our ongoing international tax activities.","For 2013, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 30%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.","On the balance sheet. Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 17.6% of sales in the first quarter compared to 17.7% for the full year 2012. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority.","Capital expenditures were $11 million for the quarter. Full year 2013 capital expenditures are expected to be $65 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $29 million for the quarter. 2013 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $118 million.","Our cash flow was excellent in the first quarter. Operating cash flow was $157 million, up 11% over last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was $146 million for the first quarter, representing 117% of net income.","Total debt was $1.32 billion at March 31, down $130 million from the 2012 yearend. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $177 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at March 31 of 30.4%, down from 33.8% at the end of 2012.","At March 31, we had approximately $840 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.","In summary, we had a strong first quarter, establishing record levels of sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.","Kevin C. Coleman","Great, thank you, Bob. Frank, we're we are now ready for to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So revenue in Q1, a little later than you were anticipating when we talked last. Was there a specific end market or region that came in a little bit later than you were thinking at this point?","Frank S. Hermance","No, I would say it was fairly broad-based, Allison. Things were just a little weaker, as most industrial companies are in fact reporting. So that's one of the reasons that we took the increased cost reduction activities in the quarter.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then obviously Boeing, the 787, I know it's a small component for you guys, but any impact from that, and how should we think about that for the year?","Frank S. Hermance","No, really. There's very minor, if any, impact from the 878. As I think you're aware, we fly on most of the commercial aircraft that fly today. No one platform is a sizable impact to AMETEK. And actually, Boeing kept the production of the 787 going, enduring their few months of difficulties. So even if it did have a more sizable impact on our volume, you wouldn't have seen it for that reason. So really -- Boeing released earnings yesterday. They had a great quarter, and I think they're going to have a great year. Matter of fact, if you look at commercial aerospace overall, they're forecasting production rates to be up about 7% this year, with Boeing up about 8% and Airbus up about 5%. So we're seeing some really good tailwinds, if you will, from commercial aerospace.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then on sort of the second half core improvement, is that mainly due to comparisons, or is there real core volume improvement that you're expecting at the end of the year?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, it is, no question, largely due to easier comparisons. Our first quarter is one of our toughest comparisons of the year. So we expect that the as we go through the year, we're going to see that improved organic growth due to the easier comparisons. But I think the key here is that we have significant confidence in our yearend EPS guidance. We've taken a little bit of additional cost reduction activities, as I mentioned, and we feel very well positioned throughout the remainder of the year, even if volume comes in a little bit on the short side, as we saw in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a little further to the second half bridge, I got the comparisons, it still looks like some materially higher sales run rate versus the second half -- I mean, versus the first half. Frank, if you could kind of comment on that observation?","Frank S. Hermance","It's just a bit up. It's not sizably up. It's just a few points higher in terms of the overall top line. So we're -- as I mentioned, we're pretty comfortable with the bottom line, and even if the top line comes in a bit softer, we feel the bottom line is going to be secure.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, is there a visibility to some project letting that's been deferred in the near term?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, there's no question that there have been some projects deferred in particularly our Process businesses, and we're starting to see activity in terms of some of those projects being released, so that is definitely encouraging to us. Aerospace, if you look at the projected build rates for 2014 over 2013, they're projected to be up. And we lead that by about 6 months, so we would expect strength in the second half of the year in Aerospace. So we feel our estimates are reasonably conservative, given a few of those positive factors that we're seeing.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then just a question on the tax rate. With 55% international, your tax rate compares a little high. Do you consistently repatriate cash, or is there a longer-term opportunity to drive that down?","Robert R. Mandos","Well, the tax rate was 29.1%. And do we consistently repatriate? Not really. I mean, we do enough to -- we actually prefer to keep our cash offshore for acquisitions. So we do just a small amount on a consistent basis.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And longer-term opportunity to have that comparable to some others with half your sales outside the U.S.?","Robert R. Mandos","Yes, for sure. I mean, we've done a lot of things over the last several years. And actually, if you look at our tax rate from the beginning of last year to where we are now, you can see there was a consistent decline. So our initiatives there are really providing some significant benefit, and we view that as a positive going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Jeffreys.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The first question is for Bob. Bob, could you split the charges -- the 2 charges by segment and corporate force on a pre-tax basis?","Robert R. Mandos","In large part, it's all -- when you look at the charge, it's largely in the operating side of the segments. And when you look at the restricted stock, it's a little bit less than a 50-50 split.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I don't understand the first part of your answer.","Robert R. Mandos","The charge for the cost realignment?","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Robert R. Mandos","That would be in the operating segments rather than general and administrative expenses.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. But I'm asking for the split between the segments.","Frank S. Hermance","Oh, okay. It's -- I got those numbers. It's $2.2 million in EMG and $1.2 million in EIG. And the second one, on the restricted shares advanced issue that we talked about, basically, if you look at how that's broken out, it's roughly $0.6 million in EMG; it's about $1 million in EIG; and about $1.1 million below the line, G&A for that.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes. I guess, the other question is on the realignment. That's different than your normal fare, I assume, that's why you're calling it out because typically, Frank, you guys incur expenses pretty much every quarter to lower costs and for productivity, so this is a little different than that, right?","Frank S. Hermance","Just a little bit in the sense that normally, after first quarter results, we're not looking to do additional cost reduction activities. And in this case, because of that weaker top line, we decided to do that. So that's the only reason that we're calling it out. And there are sizable other costs that flow through the P&L all the time. And you may have noticed in our release, we're not really calling it adjusted earnings. We like to take those charges as they come and not really look at it from an adjusted earnings viewpoint.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. The charges are within the guidance. I get it.","Frank S. Hermance","That's exactly right.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can you to tell us what the core orders were in the quarter?","Frank S. Hermance","Core orders were down about 5%, and that was against a very difficult comparison. As I mentioned, Q1 was very strong last year.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. The last question is really on the acquisitions. So we have the 3 big ones in particular from last year, and I was just wondering, on the integration side, with those things expected to be accretive, I'm sure, internally, how are those integrations going? Is there any way you can quantify for us the degree of accretion that we should see from those in 2013, if you're willing to do that?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. We just had updates, actually, on all of the acquisitions that we did last year, and the acquisitions are meeting the targets that we had set. So we're pretty comfortable with where we are. We typically don't give guidance in terms of the accretion from each of those deals, but what I can say is, they've met the objectives that we've outlined.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Frank, can you talk about kind of the linearity you experienced over the quarter from January, February, March, and kind of what the early read is on April in terms of what you saw for incoming orders?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. It was essentially flat. If you look at it, January, February and March were essentially similar. I would say that March is normally a bit higher. So if you looked at it with respect to that comparison, you could say that it was weaker, but not in absolute -- in an absolute sense. And somewhat surprisingly, I would say, and as other companies in the industrial space have indicated, April looks good. So there just seem to be a bit of a slowdown, I would say, at the end of March. Some of it may be related to the fact that the Easter holiday was right at the end of March, and -- although it's different to put any quantification around that.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then, Frank, can you talk about, specifically in the Process group of businesses, a little more granularity on end market trends and what -- where you see relative strength, where you're seeing the more pronounced weakness?","Frank S. Hermance","Sure. In the Process businesses, oil and gas is clearly the strongest part of that business. It has been growing consistently now for a multitude of quarters, and it continues to do that. Order trends are good; it looks quite positive. Some of the other parts of the Process business, in particular, some of our metal analysis businesses, those businesses are weaker than -- clearly, than the oil and gas business. Overall, the business is doing fine. The margins are incredibly good. But there is a mixture between certain parts of the Process segment, as I've indicated.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just one last one, Frank. Can you sort of talk about the magnitude of relief, maybe, you're experiencing in terms of input costs, and then what you're seeing in the price environment?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. Basically, in the first quarter, we had about 1.5 points of price. And when you look at price minus inflation, and that's not just material, that's all inflation, including labor inflation, et cetera, et cetera, that was about 0.5 point. So in essence, pricing minus inflation was about 0.5 point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baliotti from Janney Capital Markets.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Frank, could you go through -- just give us some color on the subsegments within EIG and EMG, how the sub-businesses performed?","Frank S. Hermance","Sure, I'd be glad to do that, John. So why don't we start with EIG, and I'll start with EIG Aerospace. They had a very strong order on continued strength than our commercial business, as well as the business in regional jet business. Sales were up low double digits on a percentage basis in the quarter. And we expect continued solid growth for both the commercial and the business in regional jet side of that business. And on the business of regional jet side, it's more due to our internal growth initiatives than it is general market. On the commercial business side, the general market obviously is quite positive right now. So for all of 2013, we're expecting EIG Aero to be up mid to high single digits. We talked a little bit about Process already, but let me put some rough numbers behind it. Overall sales for the Process businesses were up mid single digits on a percentage basis. Organic sales were down low single digits on a very difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2012. Overall growth in the quarter, as I've indicated already, was driven by oil and gas and obviously, the contributions from the acquisitions that we did last year. For the full year, we expect our Process businesses to grow about 10%, with organic growth up low to mid single digits. And the last part of EIG is our Power and Industrial business. For that part of EIG, we were down mid single digits on a percentage basis. It was driven largely by weakness, as we had anticipated going into the quarter, in the heavy truck market. And for all of 2013, we expect sales for Power and Industrial to be up low single digits, with strength in Power being partially offset by a weakness in Industrial. So to sum those 3 parts of Aerospace, John, for all of EIG, we expect sales to be up high single digits and organic growth up low to mid single digits. Moving to EMG. If we look at the differentiated part of EMG, overall sales for those businesses were up mid-teens on a percentage basis, on strength in our third-party Aerospace MRO businesses, as well as the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition. Organic sales were down mid single digits in the quarter, driven by weakness in our EMIP business. For all of 2013, we expect these differentiated businesses to be up high single digits on a percentage basis and organic growth in the low to mid single digits. And the last part of the company is our cost driven motors business; that performed actually very well in the quarter. Sales were flat, but profit margins were really excellent. The Operational Excellence initiatives in cost driven motors have been really, really good. And for all of 2013, we expect sales for this business to be approximately flat. So if you sum those 2 parts of EMG, we're expecting for 2013 overall growth of mid to high single digits and organic growth similar to EIG in the low to mid single-digit arena. And in both of these segments, as we've already said, we expect the second half organic growth to be stronger than the first half. So that sort of gives you a rundown of the segments.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great. And I was just curious on the cost takeouts that you've scheduled for the year, is there a way to parse them in terms of the ones that you think you're going to get volume leverage out of? The cost that really has long-term lasting benefits, is that most of it?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. I would say in terms of will these -- the benefits go into future years, the answer is definitely yes. We expect the annualized impact due to that $0.01 of charge we talked about to be around $10 million. And roughly, we're going to get half of that in this year. And in addition -- just I want to add one thing to that comment, John, that we're also -- and we talked about in the yearend conference call that we are continuing to make sizable investments in growth. We're putting about $35 million through the P&L to basically drive organic growth. And with these cost reductions that we have put in place, we have not done anything that's going to impact the longer-term growth of the company. So we've been very, very careful to target the reductions so that the organic growth of the company remains intact.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Frank, could you just address for a minute, in EIG, the acquisition contribution looks maybe lower than we would have thought. Are all those acquisitions on track from a revenue standpoint, or was something -- was there a first quarter impact there somewhere?","Frank S. Hermance","No, it's pretty much on track. We said -- or we felt that the impact of Dunkermotoren would improve as we went through the year, and in essence, it is doing that. So it had about -- on the EMG segment, it had about a 70 basis point impact. But we think over time, we will get those Dunkermotoren profit margins up very close to the other businesses of that type in the segment.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And again within EIG, though, it looks like the acquisition contribution in terms of revenue, again, it would seem Micro-Poise alone should have contributed maybe a bit more than total revenue seems to be.","Frank S. Hermance","Oh, okay, I see what you're getting at.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe my math was wrong.","Frank S. Hermance","Richard, no, no, no. You got some math that's right. We had some technology deals that went through here, and they're very small. And I think that's probably where your calculations may not exactly line up. And Kevin can go through that with you after the call, if you would like.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then also, Frank, could you just talk to -- given our core growth rate up for the quarter of kind of minus 2%, you commented about international and, in particular, the BRIC countries being very strong. But I'm curious, when you look at some of the project pushouts, maybe the small marginal sales miss for AMETEK in the quarter, would you attribute that then to U.S. and Europe, given Asia looks pretty strong?","Frank S. Hermance","It's a very interesting dynamic, and I will -- but first, I'll give you the top line answer that definitely, we saw some weakness in the U.S. that was a factor in this. And there was strength, in particular, in China. But let me back up and talk about each of the geographic regions of the world because the numbers I'm going to tell you are not initially going to sound logical until I explain them. Actually, our strongest organic growth was in Europe, and the reason for that was really twofold. One was that we have our commercial and some of our business in regional aircraft, European businesses were very strong and the MRO business in Europe was very strong. That was one factor. And the second factor was CAMECA, which is one of our highest, and EIG businesses had very large shipments into Europe in the first quarter. Conversely, when we look at Asia, even though my comment about China being strong was a very accurate comment, when we look at all of Asia, Asia was actually down organically. And the reason was, it was just the antithesis from the viewpoint of CAMECA. They had shipped a large number of systems. And as you may recall, Richard, these systems are $2 million, $3 million, $4 million each, and we had a large number of them not in China, but into -- last year, into Taiwan and into Japan, which we didn't have this year. So the CAMECA business actually overall was pretty good, it's just that there was a geographic switch between Asia and Europe. And in general, the U.S. businesses were not all that strong. They were down sort of a mid single-digit type organic growth rate. So that's sort of what happened around the world. But China sales, just in themselves, were up like 18 or 19%. I hope that's not too confusing.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","No, that's okay. Was Europe then -- was it a plus low single-digit type number on the core?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, yes. Core growth was up about 4%.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question, then. Well, let me just -- so the U.S. business was a minus mid single-digit, was that EIG related or EMG, or was there any particular market that surprised you on the soft side?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. I mean, the one that surprised us on the soft side, and I mentioned it in my some of my comments previously, was our engineered materials, interconnect and packaging business, which is in the differentiated part of EMG. That business was weak during the quarter and weaker than we had anticipated than it was going to be.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- so one last question, on the military business -- the military aerospace businesses, excuse me, that held up longer than we might have thought through the end of last year. Was that -- how did that perform in the first quarter [indiscernible]","Frank S. Hermance","It's continued to do amazingly well. It -- we had -- it was down 1 point or 2, and that's all. And the orders are continuing to come in at a very strong clip. And when we look at that, we believe that a good part of that is related to the fact that we are in areas where the part of the DoD budget that we are linked to has a higher growth rate than the base DoD budget itself. And if you just looked at sequestration, although some of those reductions haven't really taken hold yet, it would be down maybe 5%, 6%, 7%, and what we're seeing is this negative 1, negative 2 kind of percent. So that's what we think. We think it will hang in there, at that rate, through the rest of the year. And even if we're a little optimistic on that side, we believe that the commercial side is going to just continue to do extremely well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass from Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Frank, going back to the regions, how they're doing now. What are you seeing in the second half? I assume you're not anticipating CAMECA shipping all these systems for the full year, maybe you are. But is Europe going to be -- kind of trend to where everybody else is having, Europe right now, kind of flat to down, but U.S. you think is going to pick up?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, I think as we go through the year, Mark, you're going to see a more realistic growth rate that lines up with the GDP parts of the world. I think you'll see that Europe will be the weakest of the 3 major regions, that the U.S. will be in the middle and Asia will still be the best performer.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","So it seems like 1Q is a little bit of an anomaly where you're doing well in Europe but poorly in the U.S. You expect that to flip?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, I think you'll see some flip, but I don't think it's going to be at the magnitude that you're suggesting. And the reason is that we still have very strong organic growth in Europe from the Aerospace business. So we would be different than many other industrial companies that don't have that aerospace component. So I think we will be stronger in Europe, but -- than other companies. But still, of the 3 areas, it would be the weakest.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And, Bob, what were payables?","Robert R. Mandos","$343 million.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","$343 million?","Robert R. Mandos","Yes.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then lastly, Frank, haven't -- had a deal a little while, what are the expect -- what are the expectations right now between buyers and sellers? Had things gotten out of -- a little of out of whack, so you haven't been able to close deals and maybe you've thought, \"we're ready to go to\"? Just talk a little bit about the environment.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, sure. I mean, as you know, we had a phenomenal year last year. We closed 7 deals, and we closed 4 of them in the fourth quarter. So we feel very, very good about what we have done. And as we look forward, we also feel very good. The backlogs are strong. We've got a lot of deals on the table. In terms of multiples, I would say it's a mixed bag. I think you probably have heard me say this before, there are some deals that are very overpriced. And as a matter fact, I don't fully understand how other companies could acquire at the multiples that are at least being posted on those deals and really get an economic return. But then, there are other deals that are very reasonable, and we are obviously parsing our deals along the side that's reasonable. We view, the worst thing you can do on a deal is overpay because no matter what you do, from the viewpoint of the operating side, growth, whatever, you're just never going to get out of the fact that you've overpaid. So given that environment, and we feel pretty good about the rest of the year, we think growth will have a fine year, and stay tuned.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So we get the sense that there's too many people chasing too few properties or that's what it seems like.","Frank S. Hermance","No, I think if you get to larger properties, there would be some truth to that. But in the area that we're focused on, these deals that are in that $50 million -- $150 million to $200 million region, we're seeing a fair number of good candidates, and we think we can close them with reasonable multiples.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Matt McConnell from Citi Research.","Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just to follow up on that question on the pipeline, are those frothy multiples, I mean, are those from strategics or is it private equity you find kind of boosting that up? Is staple financing kind of an issue again, or -- any insight there?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, sure. I mean, my comment was directed more to strategics that are buying some of these businesses. I don't want to talk about specific companies, but we just saw one come across our desk that their multiple was 15x trailing. And to buy a company, unless it's got unbelievable growth, which is kind of questionable in the environment we're in, it's hard to get an economic return at that level. Now in fairness, in the private equity world, there is more capital available, and they can nip at some of the low end of the strategic deals. But we haven't found it to be a major problem. We have not lost any substantial number of deals, matter of fact, I can't even think of one that we've lost recently that was because of a private equity buyer.","Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And could you discuss the kind of level of visibility that you have to that higher cost takeout target, the $95 million? And then I know that would not be considered like a maximum, but what's your flexibility to move that higher if you see any kind of end market softness through the rest of the year?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, great questions. First, the visibility is excellent. We're going to have no problems in being able to achieve a $95 million of savings that I have talked about. And I think many of you have followed us for a long time, and our view is, there's always additional cost activities. As a matter of fact, an internal philosophy we use is that there's no such thing as fixed cost because in essence, you can't take out fixed cost. And therefore, if need be, we would take actions if the volume did come in lower than we're hoping that it does or what we think our present forecast are. So there are other actions that we can take. We always have a list of actions. And we will make those decisions as we look at the incoming order rate and look at our earnings for the year. And I think I can say that in my 13 years as CEO, we've never missed a quarter in 13 years. So we've got a pretty good internal process that allows us to modulate even within the quarter to ensure that we make earnings.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan of RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Frank, maybe you can talk about a couple of the end markets within the business that you talked about. You had mentioned that Power and Industrial and EIG was a bit soft. It sounds like the differentiated businesses in EMG were also. Just sort of your thoughts on the drivers for the pickup throughout the year in those areas and how you feel about the visibility.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, I think if I look at the Power and Industrial businesses, the weakness in the first quarter was driven by the heavy truck market, which is -- has been weak. If you look at the number of North American heavy vehicle -- heavy trucks that are going to be produced, the present estimates by most of the industry forecast are in the order of 240,000 trucks, down about 12%. And I would say that's consistent with what we are seeing. The comps do get a bit easier as we go through the year, which will help on the organic side. But in terms of total top line revenue, I don't think we're going to see a huge change in the Power and Industrial segment. It's different in the differentiated side. When we look at the differentiated side of EMG, and I've talked to the weakness in EMIP, which is our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging business, there is a specific market phenomena that is occurring there that we believe is going to correct itself as the year goes on, and that is, this particular business makes master alloys that are used in the production of titanium for the aerospace industry. And what is occurring there is that there was a buildup in inventory that happened really starting, let's say, in the beginning of the fourth quarter. And as a result, the shipments came down in the first quarter as they bled off that inventory. And obviously, with commercial aircraft production being very, very strong, we're going to see that trend correct itself as the year goes on, and that business, due to that market dynamic, will improve. So that we will see a stronger top line performance as the year unfolds.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that make sense. And then maybe just a follow-on, on China, we've certainly heard a mixed bag from a lot of companies this quarter. Just wondering kind of where you're seeing the strength, which businesses or products or applications. Just some color there.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, sure. I mean, our Process businesses were good in China, even our floorcare business was strong. So I wouldn't say there's any particular part of the portfolio. And strong is may be a relative word because we were growing organically in China at a 20%, 25% clip if we go back 1 year or 1.5 years ago, and now we're going strong mid single-digit kind of growth in terms of organics. So it's not where it was, but in relationship to other parts of the world, it's definitely strong.","Operator","Mr. Coleman, there are no further questions at this time.

Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. AMETEK had a solid fourth quarter. We delivered results that were in line with our expectations with strong operating performance. Following a challenging start to 2016 that included difficult market conditions, we were able to deliver solid results in the second half of the year that were consistent with our guidance and expectations.","As expected, market conditions stabilized in the fourth quarter and recent quarter trends reflect this stabilization. We are encouraged with these trends. I am also encouraged by our continued acquisition activity as we announced the acquisition of Rauland-Borg this morning. We are very excited to be acquiring Rauland-Borg given their strong niche position within the healthcare market and the outstanding leadership team that is joining AMETEK. I will provide more background on this acquisition in a moment. But, first, let me provide the financial highlights for the quarter.","Please note that any references on this call to 2016 or 2015 financial results will be on an adjusted basis. I will discuss the fourth quarter 2016 charges in a moment. Sales were in line with our expectations in the fourth quarter at $973 million, down 1.5% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Organic sales were down 3.5%, acquisitions at 3% (03:00) and foreign currency was a 1% headwind in the quarter. Overall orders in the fourth quarter were up 1% and organic orders were down 1%, continuing an improving trend in organic orders for 2016.","Operating income in the quarter was $212.7 million, and operating income margin was 21.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.58, down 8% over the last year's fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was excellent at $247 million in the quarter, up 24% over the prior year. This was a record level of operating cash flow, and it speaks to the strong operating performance across the company.","For the full year 2016, sales were $3.8 billion, down 3% versus 2015. Operating income was $841.4 million and full year operating margins were 21.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.30, down 10% versus 2015.","Now, turning to the individual operating groups; first, the Electronic Instruments Group. For the quarter, EIG reported sales of $616 million, down 2% versus last year's fourth quarter and in line with our expectations. Organic sales were down 6%, acquisitions contributed 5% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind.","The solid acquisition growth was driven by the contributions of Brookfield, ESP\/SurgeX, Nu Instruments, and HS Foils. We are seeing solid results from these acquisitions as the teams have done a great job integrating these businesses into AMETEK. The organic sales decline in EIG was driven in large part by the weakness across our oil and gas markets. Although, our oil and gas organic sales were down in the quarter, the year-over-year decline has moderated as conditions stabilized. We expect conditions to remain largely stable across our oil and gas businesses in 2017. EIG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $162.6 million and operating margins were a very strong 26.4%.","The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $356.9 million, down 1% versus the fourth quarter of 2015 with organic sales roughly flat versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 1% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind for the quarter. We are seeing improved organic growth trends and good order input for these businesses.","EMG operating income in the fourth quarter was $63 million with operating margins of 17.7%. In order to better align and reposition our cost structure to support sustained sales and earnings growth, we have taken realignment actions in the fourth quarter. These realignment actions totaled approximately $25.6 million. We expect a strong payback on these actions with annualized savings of $37 million with an approximate $16 million benefit in 2017.","We also took a $13.9 million non-cash charge in the fourth quarter related to the impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles. This was not a write-off of goodwill, but was driven by the weak global macro environment and its impact on the value of certain product line, trademark and trade names. Combined, the total charge taken in the fourth quarter was $39.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share.","Now, let me touch on some of the highlights from our growth strategies. Our four growth strategies of strategic acquisitions, new product development, global market expansion, and operational excellence have been and will be the key drivers of our success. They're well engrained in our business and culture. We view these growth strategies as critical to long-term success of AMETEK.","First, let me touch on acquisitions. We are very excited with the acquisition of Rauland-Borg. It's a great start to 2017 as we acquired an outstanding company with a strong leadership position in an attractive niche market. I would like to welcome the Rauland-Borg team to the AMETEK family. Rauland is a leading global provider of mission-critical clinical communications and workflow solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems, and post-acute care facilities.","In addition to their presence in the healthcare space, Rauland provides communication solutions to educational facilities. They're a global leader with a premier brand name and a strong presence in their markets. We expect continued strong growth for Rauland as the healthcare space continues its shift to value-based care and patient outcome improvement initiatives, both of which are key elements of Rauland-Borg's value proposition to their customers. We see attractive incremental growth opportunities by increasing its market share in international markets, expanding through additional acquisition opportunities and through leveraging our operational excellence capabilities.","Rauland was privately held with a distinguished 88-year history. They're headquartered in Mount Prospect, Illinois. Rauland has approximately $160 million in sales. The purchase price is $340 million plus a potential contingent payment of $30 million tied to achievement of certain milestones. This acquisition is an excellent example of our strategy to expand our footprint into attractive adjacent market segments.","Rauland provides us the opportunity to expand our medical technology exposure into a strong growth segment, while expanding our broad exposure to the medical market. With the acquisition of Rauland, the overall medical market exposure for AMETEK is roughly 13% of sales.","Over the last 12 months, we have deployed approximately $730 million in capital on six acquisitions and we acquired approximately $300 million in sales. We remain bullish on our acquisition pipeline and are excited to continue adding shareholder value through our proven acquisition capabilities.","Now, turning to new product development; we remain focused on investing in research, development and engineering in order to support the strong product and technology differentiation across our business. Additionally, we look to RD&E efforts as a key element in our organic growth initiative. In 2016, we spent roughly $200 million on RD&E or 5% of sales. In 2017, we expect to increase our investments in RD&E to approximately $215 million.","I'd like to highlight two of our recent new product introductions. First, AMETEK Rotron recently introduced their SemiCool Precision Fans and Custom Cooling Systems for the high reliability cooling of semiconductor processes. The SemiCool system offers precise temperature control in a compact package. It was originally designed for critical military and aerospace applications, and has been expanded to serve critical semiconductor manufacturing processes. The system consists of compact, high reliability fans and optimized heat exchangers. It is designed to meet the needs of heat-intensive processes in the semiconductor production and is a departure from the tall industrial blowers, commonly used in semiconductor facilities. The SemiCool system is compliant with semiconductor industry traceability and configuration control requirements.","AMETEK Programmable Power, a leader in programmable AC and DC power test solutions, introduced the new DC power supply for Sorensen family of DC power supplies. The new Sorensen HPX series offers state-of-the-art features and technology in a smaller footprint than comparable DC power supplies. It delivers unsurpassed performance along with fast precise programmability.","AMETEK Programmable Power are used for the design, verification, testing, quality assurance and regulatory compliance of electrical and electronic products by customers in the computer, consumer electronics, industrial controls and aerospace and defense industries. These are just two recent examples of the success of our research and development efforts. One way in which we measure the success of our RD&E efforts is through our vitality index. Our vitality index reflects the revenue from products introduced over the last three years. In 2016, our vitality index was 24%, up slightly compared to 2015.","Operational excellence continues to be an important driver of our success given its focus on cost and asset management, as well as its focus on process improvements impacting all areas of our business. Our teams are making outstanding strides utilizing our expanded operational excellence tool kit to drive continued operating improvements in their businesses. In 2016, we generated $130 million in our total operational excellence savings. Our operational excellence activities include lean manufacturing, global sourcing, strategic procurement, value analysis, and value engineering, designed for Six Sigma and strategic cost effective manufacturing initiatives.","Additionally, our activities include various tools that are focused on the frontend of our businesses to support improved organic growth. We are continuing to expand our average in this area across all of our businesses, which we believe will yield improved long-term organic growth.","Now turning to our outlook for 2017. Market conditions are improved from this time last year. The most challenging markets from 2016 have stabilized. We are realigning our cost structure, while continuing to invest appropriately in important growth areas. Our operational capabilities and cash flow generation remain unquestioned and we continue to identify and close attractive acquisition opportunities.","Although we will be appropriately cautious as we start the year, we're excited to return to sales and earnings growth in 2017. As a result, we are anticipating overall sales to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2016. Organic sales are expected to be up low-single digits from 2016. Earnings for 2017 are expected to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.46 per diluted share, up 2% to 7% over 2016.","For the first quarter of 2017, we are expecting overall sales to be roughly flat, with organic sales down low-single digits. We are expecting first quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57, flat to down 4% from 2016's first quarter.","In summary, we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter, and our business is stabilizing. We continued to aggressively manage our business for success in the short-term, while ensuring we are investing appropriately for the long-term. Our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy.","We have a talented and experienced management team, and we see tremendous opportunity to drive improved performance through the expansion of our operational excellence tools. I am excited for the future of AMETEK and believe we are well-positioned to drive strong growth.","We asked a lot of our teams in 2016, and as usual, they stepped up and delivered. I want to recognize the efforts of all our employees and thank them for their hard work.","I'll now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter and the year, and then, we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, we had a solid fourth quarter with results in line with our expectations. I'll now provide some financial highlights.","In the fourth quarter, organic selling expenses were essentially flat versus the prior year. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales in the quarter, slightly above last year's fourth quarter level of 1.2% of sales. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 27.1% versus last year's fourth quarter adjusted rate of 26.0%.","For 2017, we expect our tax rate to be between 27% and 28%. As we've said in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate.","Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was very strong in the fourth quarter at 18.4% of sales, down from 20.8% in the third quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our team in this area.","Capital expenditures were $23 million for the quarter and $63 million for the full year. 2017, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $57 million for the quarter and $180 million for the full year. We expect a similar level of depreciation and amortization, $180 million, for the full year of 2017.","Our cash flow was outstanding in the quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was a record at $247 million, up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2015.","Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $225 million, up 28% over the fourth quarter of 2015. Looking forward, for 2017, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income. The primary use of our strong free cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In 2016, we deployed approximately $390 million on acquisitions. And thus far in 2017, we have deployed $340 million on the acquisition of Rauland-Borg.","In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of our stock for $100 million. At year end, our remaining share repurchase authorization was $376 million.","Total debt was $2.34 billion at December 31, up from $1.94 billion at the end of 2015. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $717 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at December 31 of 33%.","These amounts reflect the private placement agreement we entered into on October 31 to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes denominated in euros and sterling at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%, with an 11.5 year average maturity.","The proceeds of the debt offering were used to pay down our revolver balance and to repay an existing British pound note. Overall, the private placement offering provides us with a larger financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. After the acquisition of Rauland-Borg, we have approximately $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.","In summary, we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. We are excited as we look ahead to 2017 given our proven growth strategies and the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows to support these growth initiatives. Kevin?","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Bill. Brandy, we'd like to open it up for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning, all.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. I thought I'd start with the market commentary, and specifically your mention of stabilization in the businesses. I know, historically, you've pointed to some different shorter cycle or quick shift businesses that are really a guide post for those cycle turns. I mean, could you just talk about orders in some of those proxy businesses? And may be just the trend as you move through the quarter and into January?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. The stabilization comment was really related to 2016. And we had real weakness in our oil and gas and our metals business. And as we spoke to in the last couple of quarters, we saw them stabilizing, and is charting out just as we had predicted. So, we're feeling, this time last year, we're feeling a lot of uncertainty about those two markets. But we're feeling significantly different this year. We're feeling more positive, because we think our footing is on a solid ground, and those businesses sequentially have stabilized.","We also feel good about the continuing organic orders growth in the business. I mean, when you look at the organic orders, they've slowly improved each quarter throughout 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2016 our organic orders were minus 1%, and our total orders was plus 1%. So we're feeling really good about that also. So those are a couple of factors looking at orders and looking at our markets that make us feel much more positive going into 2017 than we were going into 2016.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. And then, if I could just shift back to the Rauland deal. Could you just talk about the competitive standing in those served markets? And then, it seems like somewhat of a new adjacency for AMETEK, I mean, obviously it is an expansion of sort of the medical play. But could you just give us any color on strategic fit as well as profitability or return economics for the deal you announced this morning?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. We think we have a solid return for the deal. We're very excited to acquire Rauland, as I mentioned. The market has strong growth characteristics. It's a mid to high single-digit grower. It's a regulatory driven market. But it's also benefiting from some demographics in an aging population and a perpetual shortage of nurses. So they have some great demographics driving our business. There is high barriers to entry. There is high switching cost. Key driver is value based healthcare.","Rauland products help their customers reduce cost and improve nurse productivity and efficiency, that's the core product offering they have. They're a leading provider of mission-critical communication systems. Their product mix is about 80% hardware, 20% software. Their primary product in healthcare is called the Responder series. It has extremely high market share in the United States in a good product cycle. It's really a good product cycle in terms of the new business and also the retrofit business they can win. They are a leader in the niche. Their competition is companies like Ascom, but that's mainly international. They are a strong leader in the U.S. market.","When we think about the company, we think we can help them grow internationally. They have about 10% of their sales outside the U.S. and there is also some acquisitions that they wanted to acquire. And being privately owned by a family, they really didn't want to have that risk tolerance. So we think it's a great opportunity for AMETEK to fund the business to grow internationally and also look into additional acquisitions.","So, we did a lot of market work on the business and the market study that came back for this business has some of the highest scores that we ever saw on customer satisfaction. So the people do a great job around our businesses and we think that we can add a lot of value to it and it will be a great deal for our shareholders.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's good color. And anything you could provide on profitability maybe relative to the corporate structure of AMETEK today?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. It's less profitable to AMETEK obviously. It will be a \u2013 a mid-teens EBIT kind of number would be a good number to look at.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, gents.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hello, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. So, David, you mentioned oil and gas stabilized. So, does your outlook for 2017 \u2013 does that bake in a flat outlook for your oil and gas process markets in general?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, it really does. There is a \u2013 we expect 2017 sales will be flattish, but we think the upstream business will be up a little bit, and the mid and downstream businesses will be down slightly to flat. So we expect a little bit of sales improvement throughout the year. It's similar to when we went in for the oil and gas downturn, the upstream goes down first. While we are coming out of it, the upstream is starting to pick up. But we'll expect the midstream and downstream markets to improve later in the year, and maybe even next year. So it will be flat to down slightly for mid and downstream and up for the upstream.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the 1Q guides, I'm sorry if I missed this, what organic sales estimate are you assuming for 1Q, and any commentary on January trends would be helpful, too?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. January came in, in line with what we thought and organic growth for Q1 is down low single digits. We're feeling better, but we're really calling a transition from negative organic growth to positive organic growth. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, and we think the trend will improve for the year. But Q1 is down low single digits.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then just one more. Can you make just a comment on EMG margins. They are a bit, little bit lighter than what we are looking for (26:26)?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, sure. EIG had a great quarter, and EMG was down a bit, and the EMG margins were driven by mix in our EMIP business. That business has a little higher fixed cost than the average AMETEK. So when the orders are lower, they are going to \u2013 margins are going to drop a bit. But the positive thing is we saw positive orders growth. Actually, EMG orders turned positive in Q4, and when you look at sequentially from Q4 to Q3, we had 50% contribution on the incremental volume. So we had a great quarter. EIG did a little better, and EMG did a little worse.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much.","David A.

Good morning, everyone.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Dean.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, just to follow-up on the Rauland acquisition, just a couple of data points. How much is aftermarket as is typical in the mix? And then, are there any concerns with the Affordable Care Act, and how some of the funding for products and services like Rauland that might be impacted?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, great question, Dean. About 10% to 20% of the business was aftermarket, and the aftermarket is evolving because software is becoming a more important product offering for the business and software upgrades will increase that in the future. The repeal of the ACA, we did a lot of work on that and it really in the middle and long-term does not impact the value proposition of Rauland. They are strong demand drivers and minimum risk in the near-term.","The fundamental issue is that, they help nurses work more efficiently. They're in a sweet spot of driving value-based healthcare and we got very comfortable with it. However, we had the same concern, and we were concerned that the potential market uncertainly could cause some spending delays in the near-term, that the market pause with all the changes. So we expect it to be minimal, but to be prudent, we structured the deal as an earn out, tied to revenue levels within the first two years. So we feel we acquired an excellent business and we have protected \u2013 we've added a degree of protection to our shareholders and we feel confident that we will earn our return on capital in both outcomes, either outcome. But we think we're going to pay the earn out, and we think that business is going to perform.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Is that earn out \u2013 is that a year from now where that gets trued up?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. It's a couple of years and it's tied to revenue.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And I was on the website this morning. It's real helpful. Did you say what that split was between healthcare and education markets?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. The healthcare part was 90% and the education market is 10%. The education market is growing quite nicely. They have a new product called the Telecenter U and it's really involved in mission-critical communication. So, along with connecting classrooms and facilities across school districts, it also managed emergency communications for school districts, so it's seeing a good demand in the current environment.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then just on the quarter, and I might have missed this, but what's the \u2013 how did it play out in terms of typical seasonality for typical fourth quarter? Did you see any budget flush? Did you see any kind of year-end ordering? How did that play out this quarter?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","When we were in Q3, we had a bit of a ramp projected for Q4 and we talked about we see some kind of year-end spending, little bit less than typical we expected it to occur and it occurred just like we thought. So, there's a little bit of year-end money returning to more typical patterns, but not like it was a few years ago.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","David A.

What do you think is the good run rate for AMETEK in terms of free cash flow conversion to net income going forward?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I think in the 115% to 120% on a go-forward basis is a reasonable place for AMETEK to be.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. And can you just talk about M&A environment after the election? How does tax uncertainty and deductibility of interest, and but probably more regulatory visibility interplay when you talk to people?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","It really hasn't affected our business that much. I mean, our acquisition pipeline is strong. We mentioned, with the Rauland deal, we had some additional market work to do there, but for most of our businesses, it seems that our pipeline work is going strong and there are ample people trying to sell the business, and ample buyers. So the market is still running at elevated pricing. It is still more money chasing deals, and we haven't seen any change in that in the last day since the election.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And if I could just squeeze one more in. On your oil and gas upstream business, how much of it is domestic versus international?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","About one-third is domestic, and two-thirds is international.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And what's the region, is it Middle East?","David A.

Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I think I'll just go ahead and steal Scott Graham's question, and just do the state of the organic growth on the orders. Sorry, Scott. So, if you just could go around and do that?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","So you want me to go around the sub segments.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, that would be great.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","I'll start with the aerospace. The overall sales for our aerospace business were down mid single-digits in the quarter. Fourth quarter results were similar to the full year of solid organic growth across our commercial business was more than offset by continued weak markets in business jet and regional jets. Looking ahead to 2017, we expect our aerospace business to be up organically low single-digits to mid single-digits with growth across each of our aerospace segments.","Our Process segment, organic sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter, driven largely by our oil and gas businesses, we talked about that. As expected, conditions stabilized in the quarter. Our Ultra Precision Technology business had another very solid quarter to cap an excellent year with notably strong growth in both our Creaform and TMC Precitech businesses. We are encouraged with the stabilization we're seeing on the Process segment and expect this will continue into 2017. And for all of 2017, we expect organic sales for our process businesses to be up low single-digits with organic growth for our oil and gas businesses roughly flat.","In our Power and Industrial segment, overall sales were up 10%, driven by the contribution of the Brookfield Engineering acquisition. Organic sales were down mid single-digits in the quarter and in line with expectations. The weakness was largely a result of softness in the heavy truck market. Switching to 2017, we expect organic sales for Power and Industrial to be roughly flat with modest growth in Power offset by weakness in our Industrial.","In our differentiated EMG businesses, they were down low single-digits in the quarter, with weakness driven by our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging businesses. As expected, conditions have stabilized across our EMIP businesses. And for 2017, we expect organic growth for all of differentiated EMG to be up low-single digits versus 2016, with our EMIP business expected to be flat.","And finally, our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business, organic sales in our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business were up 10% in the quarter and we expect sales for this business to be down low-single digits organically.","So, to summarize, for the full year, we expect overall AMETEK sales to be up mid-single digits and for organic sales to be up low single digits. For EIG, we expect overall sales to be up mid-single digits and organic sales to be up low-single digits. And for EMG, we expect overall sales to be up low-single digits and organic sales to be up low-single digits.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much for that. As a follow-up, maybe \u2013 and you might have spoken to this before either in your prepared remarks or questioning and I might have missed it, so I do apologize. But, have you talked about the EPS accretion for 2017 and 2018 for the existing deal? And then could you just give us an update of your M&A balance sheet firepower capacity, now that this deal has been closed?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Now that the deal is closed, we have about $1.5 billion in firepower. So we're very active and we'd like to do more deals and use some of that capacity this year. In terms of the Rauland deal impact on 2017, I think what you'll see, when you buy a business, there's a lot of accounting and one-time things that go on and you'll see some benefit in the second half of the year, not much benefit in the first half of the year, and you put that benefit in the $0.03, $0.04 range in the second half.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","$0.03, $0.04, so embedded in your guidance this year is probably $0.03 to $0.04 of earnings accretion from this deal?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Good morning. Just \u2013 kind of a follow up to the oil and gas and specialty metals business. Can you remind us sort of if we call 2014, 2015 the peak and we call 2016 kind of the trough, how much revenue have you lost in both of those businesses? Try and size that up for me a bit?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. So if you go back to the peak on oil and gas, there was about $400 million in revenue and entering 2017, it will be about $240 million in revenue, so we lost $160 million in revenue. So it was down about 40% from the peak. The upstream was down about 70%, and the midstream and downstream was down about 23%, 24%. And if you look at the EMIP business in metals, at the peak that business was about $500 million and we lost about 25% or $125 million, so that's about $375 million now going into 2017.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then, just with respect to the aerospace side of the business, can you provide a little bit more granularity around kind of what transpired in 2016 and what the expectations are for 2017 with large commercial being a bucket business regional and then military, and maybe if you can just talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the aftermarket side, including third-party MRO that would be helpful? Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure. As I said, we're expecting low to mid-single digit for our aerospace segment in 2017. When you think about the commercial market, we expect that to continue strong. I think Boeing and Airbus are projected to increase build rates this year in the low-to-mid single-digit range and we have new additional content that we want on aircraft. So we expect to be up mid-single digits due to the ramp in new aircraft in the commercial area.","In regard to the third-party MRO business, we expect to be up mid-single digits, just grow solid growth as revenue passenger miles expand and we're well positioned in a couple of niche areas to grow our services.","The military market, which is about 35% of our total aerospace exposure, we expect that to be up low-single digits in 2017. And in 2016, there was \u2013 we had some \u2013 we were down mid-single digits and we expect that can be positive for us going up low-single digits in 2017.","And in terms of the Bizjet market, that's a smaller part of our aerospace business. We expect modest sales growth off of a reduced sales level and the market we're expecting to be flat, but we do have some new program wins driving the growth.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great.

(Broker)","Yes, good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hi, Rick.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Dave and maybe Bill, I wanted to just maybe explore, if I look at the guidance for 2017 from an EPS perspective and walk up to P&L, it looks like the incremental margin assumption for 2017 is something on the order of 0% to maybe 18% at the EBIT line and that's kind of adjusted. And I am curious, there is \u2013 it looks like maybe your RD&E is going up. There should, however, maybe be some restructuring save in there, and also \u2013 is there any \u2013 what are you kind of bearing in the numbers for operational excellence costs? And maybe can you just kind of walk me to the incremental margin assumption that underlies your EPS guide?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. I'll try to do that. I mean, first of all, OpEx, we have about $100 million of OpEx working in the numbers. As I said before, we got some acquisition growth, about $0.03 or $0.04, total acquisition growth. RD&E is up about 5% \u2013 7% to $215 million. We do have some discrete incremental headwinds. FX will be about a point of sales and capital (41:56) $0.03 is the headwind.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Tax and interest will be about a $0.05 of headwind.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.

The growth...","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","We have growth investments in sales, marketing and engineering and that's offsetting some of the savings you'd see from our typical material sourcing efforts as well as other cost reductions, which would include the realignment activities that Dave talked about earlier.","David A.

So down, okay, I get you. And then just one last question. You did give a little bit of a description around the metals businesses and we enter a $375 million of revenue and I am curious what was the \u2013 is that kind of captured in the EMIP growth rate? Are you expecting the $375 million to be flattish and then...","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then what does the margin look like there? I mean, we've talked about that being a pass through contribution. We are seeing metals prices starting to ratchet up a little bit. I mean, is flat revenue associated with maybe a lower margin relative to where metals prices are going in 2017?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. The EMIP business is about at the AMETEK average profitability. And in terms of metals prices, I think it's a little bit of a mix for the key commodity trends for our business \u2013 for our business, vanadium is a key metal, that's plus 30%. Titanium sponge, molly, and nickel are flat to down and titanium scrap is down about 15%. So it's a mixed environment for the metals that matter most to EMIP.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Isn't that business pretty heavily weighted towards aerospace and just the driver being maybe GE on the LEAP engine side there. But, should that business perform a little bit better than flat in 2017?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. We're being conservative calling that business.","Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah.

Go ahead.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Yeah. Can you talk about Rauland-Borg acquisition? You did mention, I think you gave the mix in terms of equipment versus software. Could you give us a sense how the software part of the business has grown historically? I think, Dave, you gave a number in terms of, I don't remember that, but if you can just give us how the software is going and where would the investment from AMETEK come into the business in terms of, on the equipment side of the software side? Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. It's a \u2013 the history of the businesses is predominantly hardware, but software is becoming an increasingly important part of the future software offering. And as we try to extend the nurse call platform to multiple hospitals, you get an enterprise wide platform and that's more software intensive, and that's a part of the business that's very attractive and growing.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","And I'm sure you guys have done some market studies. Could give us a sense of how big the market is here? Or in terms of international, any particular geographies you plan to extend sales from this acquisition?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes. As I mentioned earlier, because it's a family-owned business, they ran the business exceptionally well. But they saw risk in acquisitions and international expansion, and only about 10% of the business is international. And we think the market is about half international. So we think we can help them with that and we think there is considerable runway to improve the business.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And lastly, I just wanted to get a sense of, in terms of BRICS, how did that do actually in the fourth quarter, and how we're thinking about the markets like in terms of 2017, especially China?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. Yeah. We had \u2013 52% of our sales were international in the quarter, and from my view, the two highlights in the quarter were; the U.S. market was much stronger than prior quarters. And we were down about 10% for several quarters in a row in the U.S. and it was down only 2% organically. And that was the strength in our process businesses really across the board, so the U.S. was improving and Asia was about flat organically, and China was up 5%. So the fact that China was up 5% and the U.S. was improving, we're encouraged by that. Europe was down, low mid single digits in line with recent trends. When you look at the BRIC countries in total, they were plus 1% organically in sales in Q4, again with China dominating that, India was flat. So, overall with the U.S. improving and with China now stabilized and starting to grow, we feel pretty good about what we're seeing geographically in our end markets.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Thanks a lot.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Foung with Gabelli & Company.","James V. Foung - G.research LLC","Hi. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hello.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Hi, Jim.","James V. Foung - G.research LLC","Hi, good morning. So just getting back to Rauland-Borg, maybe you could just kind of highlight some of the key products they make on the hardware side since 80% of their business is there? And then, who your competitor has been of (49:57) your hardware and software?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. I'll talk about the products in the healthcare space. The primary product is called the Responder series and it connects all the nurse call stations in a hospital. It's really an indispensable tool for nurses. It provides multiple levels of functionality. It provides a virtual whiteboard status for each patient, so they know the patient status, a nurse at the nurse station can know the patient status for each patient. It provides voice communication between the nurse and patient and it also manages the patient and hospital alarm system, so the alarms in the hospital are controlled by the Rauland system. So it's a indispensable tool for hospitals and an indispensable tool for nurses, and as I mentioned earlier, it's a fantastic tool for hospitals to manage and efficiently utilize our nursing capability. As we know, there has been a perpetual shortage of nurses. So, they're right at the sweet spot of demographic trends, perpetual shortage of nurses and there is a high degree of regulation in the market, the switching costs are very high. So they're right from the product operating cycles and we're bringing new capabilities. So we feel really good about the product offering.","As I mentioned, the big competitor will be Ascom internationally, Hill-Rom also has some products in the market, but Rauland-Borg in the U.S. is the market share leader by far.","James V. Foung - G.research LLC","Okay. And then what's the CapEx in that business?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","It's about at the AMETEK average, it's 2% or less CapEx.","James V. Foung - G.research LLC","Okay. Terrific. And then just on getting back to the energy and then the metals business, I guess, you're forecasting flat sales and you say that's kind of conservative. But, what has to happen for you to be more optimistic, as you can reach some growth in that market and may be climb back up to that peak level in a couple of years?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I think the trends that are \u2013 we're working through a long cycle, and it's a predictable cycle, and past cycles have been very similar, although not as deep. And it's going to start with the upstream business picking up, and then it's going to flow through to the midstream and downstream, and will probably be a year or two years before the market totally gets returns. At the current price of oil, it's a lot lower than what it was, but it's enough for a positive business to take place. Rig counts were up and that's key for our upstream business. And what customers are telling us is, they actually have capital to spend this year.","Last year they really didn't. The authority to spend is back on the business units instead of the C-Suite. They were \u2013 all purchase orders had to go to the C-Suite before they'd buy anything. And for our equipment there is some excess capacity out there, and it needs to be utilized. But we're seeing increased activity in the upstream space now, especially in the U.S., and for the midstream and downstream business, we think that's going to be flat to down a bit this year, but we're seeing some good project business in the Middle East. So we're feeling much better this year than we were last year at this time.","James V. Foung - G.research LLC","Okay. Great. Look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks time.

Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company.","Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe today. I just wanted to talk about the size of your M&A. You've talked before about doing a larger deal, and then, by the way, congrats on the one this morning. But, what drove that change in mindset, and why the change now? Is it because do you see perhaps the distortion in pricing between small companies and larger ones?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","No, as I said before, our bread and butter acquisition is still the $50 million, $100 million, $150 million deal, and that's going to stay that way and we had tremendous value to those kind of businesses. But we've been successful in slightly larger deals. So about 9 months ago we expanded our pipeline to include revenue size one notch higher, between $200 million to $500 million. And really we did that because as the business scales and we want to continue our track record of doubling the earnings for the company, we felt that we had to add those larger businesses to our candidate list and we also felt that we've been very successful doing a larger deal. I mean the bigger deals that we've done, we bought ZYGO a couple of years ago, that business is performing extremely well for AMETEK. We bought Dunkermotoren a few years ago, the business is performing extremely well for AMETEK. We've acquired Haydon Kerk. The business is performing extremely well. So we're getting comfortable doing larger deals, but at the same time, we have not stopped doing the bread-and-butter deals. So we just think as we grow and we continue to generate more cash flow, we want to expand our opportunity set.","Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company LLC","Great. Thanks. And then just a second quick one here. Do you feel like you have maintained your market share throughout the cycle or this cycle?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes, I do. Yeah. Just finished our...","Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company LLC","Okay.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","...strategic planning process about three months ago. We went into that in detail and we're very comfortable with that.","Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company LLC","All right.

Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Just with Rauland being less of immediate adjacency, you've talked about evolving your process for deal sourcing. Could you describe the process for sourcing Rauland, how it exemplifies some of your, kind of expanded look on cultivating the pipeline?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure. I mean, in situations with private companies who are looking to sell their business or looking for a credible seller that has the business model that's flexible enough to deal with the private company. And AMETEK has shown that capability. We have the reputation of being able to do that. And I think Rauland approached a banker and they approached very few companies, because of the uniqueness of the situation, and we're lucky enough to work with the family and get the deal done, and now part of AMETEK. So I think it's really the reputation of AMETEK and the work we're doing in the medical space that kind of in combined brought that business to AMETEK.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And I just wanted to try a little more succinctly, sync up the 1Q bridge to the full year. It looks like a little bit of a slow start that's maybe a little inconsistent with the full year expectation. So just maybe a comment on the bridge?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I mentioned earlier, we're calling a transition from negative organic growth to positive organic growth and in our business with the very high contribution margins, when you get positive organic growth, it's very accretive to profit. But, on the converse, when you have negative organic growth, it's difficult to call that turnover. And we called low single digits for the first quarter, we think that's the right call. And we think that some markets talked about oil and gas are going to grow slowly throughout the year. We're going to see that continuing trend of slight improvement. The benefits also, of course, the benefits of our realignment are a bit back-end loaded. We talked about the realignment and we talked about the benefits of $16 million, and those are going to more favorably impact Q3 and Q4 than Q1 and Q2. And as we've mentioned earlier, Rauland really impacts Q3 and Q4 more than Q1 and Q2 because of some of the acquisition accounting. So those are the three things I'd point you to look at the \u2013 a little bit of a ramp in the earnings for the year.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks for summarizing.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hi, Allison. Good morning.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Dave, you talked about the medical and marketing 13% of sales today now with the Rauland acquisition. What's your comfort level in terms of waiting there? I know you mentioned a number of potential opportunities in the pipeline on that side.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. AMETEK's strategy is to be in a bunch of diverse end-markets and we run businesses very effectively in a niche position. So even in the medical space that same limitation occurs. So we don't have a fixed percentage, but any time a product or a market area gets 20% of the company, then we start to think about our diversification and \u2013 but we still have room to go and we're still active at looking at the medical space.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And then just to touch on that, just management capacity in that specific business line or end-market space. Are you comfortable there to continue even though with the latest two acquisitions there?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, we are. The one thing that I mentioned in my opening remarks was, we're getting a very good management team with Rauland. Sales and marketing capability is outstanding. We spent time with the management team. We feel really good. It's going to be a good cultural fit and we feel really good that we're going to bring what we do well to them. So feel really good about the future and the management capability with Rauland.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And then just R&D, you stepped it up. Is there a specific weighting towards the allocation? Is it broad? Any changes there relative to 2016?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","No, no. I think you know our system. I mean, it comes from the bottom up in terms of R&D and the business managers have to tell us what they want to work on and show us that it's a good project to fund and they'll get the funding. But the only thing is we really focused on taking our R&D dollars and spending it in the growth area. So there is a little bit of that, but really it was the same process. It's distributed. It's across all of our businesses. It's a low risk approach, and as I mentioned, we have 24% of sales from new products, so we think that's a healthy level and we have really good engineering capability throughout the company.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Allison.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with A.O. Smith Corporation (sic) [BMO Capital Markets].","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Scott, did you join A.O. Smith?","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Brandy, I think he might have \u2013 Scott's not on the line.","Operator","Scott, your line is open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes. I am speaking. Can you hear me?","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Now, we can, Scott. Yeah.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","We hear you now, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I have no idea how I am identified with A.O. Smith. I'm going to blame it on Rob McCarthy though.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","He took all of your question.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Wow, that was odd. Okay. So, two questions for you. The one is on the $100 million of cost saves. That's a number that is a little bit higher than what I was thinking. Could you tell me what the procurement piece specifically was in that and then also give us the 2016 final number there?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. The procurement number was $60 million for 2017, so $60 of a $100 million.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Sorry.","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","And in 2016, the procurement was $60 million also.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Now, to the same end, Dave, you entered the year with a better organic growth view with the incremental margins from the last restructuring higher on the upside. We have an accretive acquisition and you have guidance that captures the expectations. So I'm sitting there wondering is the $100 million of savings, we're going to see a larger percentage of those savings now being reinvested under Dave Zapico than in the past, those savings were reinvested?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","No. I don't think that's necessarily true. I mean we talk about $65 million of growth investments, and we feel it's important to properly fund our sales and marketing expenses on our engineering, but we had a similar amount last year. So, I don't think there is a meaningful change in that area. We're going to make sure that we invest for the future, but it sits in line with the past.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Is there anything specifically about the spending however going forward that you're changing under, sort of under your lot shares that maybe a little bit more focused on areas where there has historically been more growth? What type of shifting in that spending view and vision?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. That's a great question, Scott. I mean, if you want to look at it at the overall level, I think there will be incrementally more spending in sales and marketing expenses, but the same amount of expenditures will be put back in each year. I mean we'll have healthy cost reductions offsetting the investments, but there are some opportunities in sales and marketing, and we're funding some of them this year. So we think they're going to adequately return for AMETEK over the longer term or to benefit from them later this year.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And sort of the last add-on to this, is there \u2013 do you envision more spending perhaps to build out channels in the BRICS countries, perhaps in Europe? Is there anything that you see that you may have an opportunity to put some money down and to generate sales growth off that?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. That's a great question, Scott. I mean, one of our investments that we're making this year is an expansion in Southeast Asia. So that's exactly what we're thinking. We see some opportunities in our UPT business, our Ultra Precision Technology business, our Materials Analysis division in Southeast Asia, and one of the key investments that we're making is expansion in sales and marketing channels in that area.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Very good. That's all I had. Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc.","Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks for getting me in. Just two quick ones on Rauland. Do you see \u2013 are there adjacent products that you're developing to sell on to that platform? Or do you see the opportunity as more getting the platform into more facilities?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. It's both. I mean, there are adjacent product areas in the non-acute care facilities. There are adjacent product areas in the existing customer base and there are adjacent opportunities internationally. So we feel really good about all the avenues of growth.","Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Are some of those products already under development or is this something that you've looked at the platform and you see the opportunity and now the work starts?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Now, Rauland has some of these products under development, and some of the other product areas are more driven by acquisition than organic development.","Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And you said half of the market opportunity could be international which is they haven't really pursued. But do you have a dollar amount of what you see is the total addressable market for both the healthcare and the educational side?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. We did the market work and the existing SAM, the served addressable market was about $500 million and the TAM, the total addressable market, was about $1 billion. And we didn't include a lot of the TAM in our discussions, but those are the kind of \u2013 it's a niche market, it's a $500 million sort of market. They don't participate much internationally and we feel good about the potential growth opportunities.","Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to the speakers for further closing remarks.","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Thanks everyone for joining.

I'll now turn the meeting over to Frank.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered solid operational results in the quarter to complete another strong year. We achieved a record level of operating income, operating margins, and diluted earnings per share in 2015 despite a very challenging global macro environment.","Looking ahead, we expect these difficult conditions to persist in 2016. Therefore, we have taken additional realignment actions in the fourth quarter to help minimize the effects of the ongoing global softness. These realignment costs totaled $20.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share. And we expect annualized savings of approximately $35 million as a result of these actions with an approximate $20 million benefit in 2016.","Before covering the financial results, please note that any references to 2014 or 2015 financial results will be on an adjusted basis excluding the realignment cost in 2015 and the Zygo integration cost in 2014.","Now, on to the fourth quarter and full-year results. In the fourth quarter, sales were $988 million, down 4% from last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales were down 4%, acquisitions added 3%, and foreign currency was a 3% headwind.","Operating income in the quarter was $229.5 million, down 1% versus 2014's comparable quarter. Operating income margin for the fourth quarter was very strong at 23.2%, a 50 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $150.7 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were flat with last year's fourth quarter.","For the full year 2015, sales were $4 billion, down 1% versus 2014. Operating income was a record $944.3 million, up 3% from 2014. And full year 2015 operating margins increased 100 basis points to a record 23.8%. Diluted earnings per share were up 5% over 2014, ending the year at $2.55 per diluted share, a record level.","Now, turning to the individual operating groups, the Electronic Instruments Group had a good quarter with solid operating performance. For the quarter, EIG reported sales of $628.4 million, down 2% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was down 2% while the Surface Vision acquisitions added 2% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind.","Solid growth in our Aerospace and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses was more than offset by weakness in our upstream Oil & Gas business as a result of the continued slump in oil prices. EIG's operating income increased 2% to $170.9 million, and operating margins were superb at 27.2% in the quarter, a 110 basis point improvement over last year's fourth quarter.","The Electromechanical Group managed well through a very difficult market environment. Sales were $359.6 million in the quarter, down 5% from last year's comparable quarter, with organic sales down 8%. The acquisition of Global Tubes contributed 5%, and foreign currency was a 3% headwind.","The lower sales were driven largely by the impact from commodity price deflation in our Engineered Materials Interconnects & Packaging businesses, as well as soft demand in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business EMG's operating income of $70.9 million was down 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating margins were 19.7% in the quarter, down 60 basis points from last year's fourth quarter.","Now, turning to our four growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions. In 2015, we acquired two businesses, Global Tubes and Surface Vision. We deployed approximately $360 million of capital, and acquired roughly a $180 million in sales on these two acquisitions.","2016 is off to a solid start, as we announced today the acquisition of two additional businesses, Brookfield Engineering Laboratories and ESP\/SurgeX. Combined, we deployed approximately $300 million in capital and acquired nearly $100 million in sales.","First, I will touch on Brookfield. Brookfield Engineering Laboratories is the global leader in viscosity measurement instrumentation for quality control application. Brookfield provides a complete range of viscometers and rheometers as well as instrumentation for the analysis of texture and powder flow. Key applications for Brookfield's products include research, development and production of food and beverage, pharmaceutical, paint and petroleum-type products.","The addition of Brookfield allows AMETEK to expand our laboratory instrumentation platform into a broader range of adjacent markets and applications. Brookfield is headquartered in Middleboro, Massachusetts, with additional operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, China and India. The company has annual sales of about $55 million.","Now, let me touch on ESP\/SurgeX. They are a leader in power protection. Their patented protected products operate at the plug level and monitor, protect, analyze and diagnose power-related issues remotely or onsite. In addition, their products help control power to mission critical equipment.","ESP is a great strategic fit with our existing power protection platform. It is highly complementary with our recently acquired Powervar business, providing us with new opportunities for product innovation and market expansion. They are headquartered in Knightdale, North Carolina, and they have annual sales of approximately $40 million.","Over the last 24 months, we've acquired eight businesses, deployed over $1.1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $510 million in annual revenue.","Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us throughout the year, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value, especially in low growth environments. Acquisitions will also continue to be the primary use of our strong cash flow and financing facilities, which gives us ample liquidity to continue the strategy.","Now, turning to Global & Market Expansion, we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our global sales channels, service infrastructure and manufacturing footprint in emerging markets to capitalize on the attractive long term growth opportunities. In the fourth quarter, international sales represented 53% of our total sales. Our Ultra Precision Technologies division continues to see great results from their global expansion investments with mid-teens organic sales growth across Asia in the fourth quarter. Their Taylor Hobson business delivered excellent growth in China and India in the quarter, following recent investments to expand their sales and service infrastructure in these two key markets.","Also, their Creaform business continues to see great growth internationally, with double-digit growth in Asia in the quarter. This growth is being driven by continued development of their sales network across Asia and from strong expansion in the quality control market driven by a number of recent new product introductions.","Now, moving on to new products. Our businesses are doing an outstanding job developing new products to serve their existing markets, and to help penetrate adjacent markets and applications. We have consistently invested in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers.","As reflected in our vitality index, we continue to see excellent results from these efforts. Revenue from products introduced over the last three years was strong at 26% of sales in the quarter, up from 25% in the last year's fourth quarter. In 2016, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E or about 5% of sales.","We're excited about some recent new product introductions. Our TMC business, a leader in precision vibration isolation systems recently introduced the Everstill K-400, a compact vibration cancellation system. The Everstill is ideal for small vibration-sensitive instruments such as optical microscopes, scanning probe microscopes and metrology instruments. Its patented vibration cancellation technology is especially suited for the 1 hertz to 10 hertz vibration range where precision instruments tend to be the most sensitive. The portable Everstill is ideal for bench tops and worktables as it requires only a standard AC power outlet.","The LEAP 5000, the latest generation of atom probe microscopes from our CAMECA business was recognized by R&D magazine with an R&D 100 Award. Widely recognized as the Oscars of innovation, the R&D 100 Award is presented annually to the 100 most significant new developments in research and development as determined by an independent panel of judges. This product was recognized as a breakthrough instrument whose unique capabilities have enabled engineers and scientists to gain new insight into materials and processes.","Lastly, AMETEK Power Instruments recently added an IEC version of their JEMStar II electricity revenue meter for use outside North America. The JEMStar II is the most accurate revenue meter on the market with the broadest communication options and features the industry's first color graphic display. The meter is specifically designed for applications with a high electric usage such as utility generation and transmission substations","I will now touch on operational excellence. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continued operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the operational excellence tools we have put in place throughout the company. In slow growth environments, the success of our operational excellence initiatives takes on an even greater importance as we are able to drive meaningful margin expansion while continuing to invest in key growth initiatives.","Overall, we realized approximately $150 million in savings in 2015 through our various operational excellence initiatives. The largest contributor to these savings was our global sourcing and strategic procurement activities where we recognized approximately $75 million in savings for all of 2015. For 2016, we expect approximately $120 million in total savings through our operational excellence initiatives, including $60 million in savings through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives","Turning now to the outlook for 2016, we do not anticipate a meaningful change in global economic conditions in 2016. We expect sluggish conditions across oil and gas, emerging markets and the broad industrial markets to continue. As a result, we anticipate 2016 revenue to be up low single-digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic growth down low single-digits for all of AMETEK.","Earnings for this year are expected to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share, probably focused more on the lower end of that range and that's flat to up 4% over 2015. First quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single-digits from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings in the first quarter to be approximately $0.56 to $0.58 per diluted share versus $0.63 in last year's first quarter.","So, in summary, our overall business performed well in the fourth quarter and for all of 2015. We delivered record operating results in 2015 despite persistent global economic weakness. Our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to continue to invest in our businesses and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our strong portfolio of businesses and commitment to driving success through our four growth strategies should enable us to continue to deliver strong and consistent long-term growth.","Before turning the call over Bob Mandos to cover the financial details, I wanted to note that Bob has decided to retire effective May 15 of this year. Bob has done a tremendous job over his 35 years of service with AMETEK and he will be greatly missed. I want to thank Bob for all his contributions to AMETEK and wish him all the best in his retirement. Bill Burke, who many of you know, will be assuming the CFO role on May 15. Bill has also done a superb job for AMETEK over his 28-year career and is well suited for his new role.","Now, Bob, if you could cover the financial details. Please.","Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a good fourth quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details.","In the quarter, selling expenses were down roughly in line with sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales in the quarter, unchanged from last year's fourth quarter level of 1.2% of sales. Other expense in the quarter was up approximately $6.3 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014 due to an insurance gain in last year's fourth quarter.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% versus last year's fourth quarter rate of 27.1%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing international tax planning initiatives. For 2016, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 28%. As we had said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.","On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19% of sales in the fourth quarter down slightly from the third quarter level. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital spending was $24 million for the quarter and $69 million for the full year. Full year of 2015 capital expenditures were 1.7% of sales. 2016 capital expenditures were expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million for the quarter and $150 million for the full year. 2016 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $165 million.","Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $199 million and free cash flow was $176 million representing 128% of net income. Excluding the $50 million contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan in the first quarter, full-year 2015 operating cash flow was $723 million and full-year free cash flow was $654 million or 111% of net income.","The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In 2015, we spent the $360 million on acquisitions and thus far in 2016, we have deployed approximately $300 million on acquisitions.","In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock to approximately $130 million. Total debt was $1.94 billion at December 31, up approximately $230 million from 2014 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $381 million resulting in net debt to capital ratio at December 31 of 32.4%.","At December 31, we had approximately $930 million of cash in existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.","In summary, we had a strong 2015. We are well positioned with strong balance sheet and cash flows to support our growth initiatives.","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Bob. Frank, we're now happy to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Frank, we would like to open up for questions now.","Operator","Thank you.","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, are you there? Okay, one moment, while we check on the status of our operator.","Okay. So those people on the call, one second. We're going to have to work with the operator to get him back on the line.","Operator","Our question comes for the line of Matt McConnell from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I'm not sure if you're on it. I can't hear a response, but I'll just go ahead with the question in case it's going through. I wonder if you could add any visibility around maybe your conviction for the 2016 outlook? I know you're already talking it kind of to the low-end of expectations, but just how do you about planning in an environment like this where it's probably hard to tell whether things are getting incrementally worse or not? I'll just leave it at that. Thank you.","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, everyone. This is Kevin from AMETEK. The operator is dialing back in so we should get started back up here in a minute or two. Thanks for your patience.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to stand by. Your conference will begin momentarily. We thank you for your patience. Okay. Our first question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, guys.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry for what occurred, Matt. I don't know what the technical difficulty was. It was not on our end, so.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. No problem at all. Just hoping to get some visibility around your conviction on the 2016 outlook. You're already setting expectations kind of for the low end. Just how do you go about planning in an environment like this where it's probably hard to tell whether things are getting worse or flattening out. Just any more insight into how you plan in that kind of environment and level of conviction?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, it's very difficult as you stated. There are a lot of moving factors right now in the global economy. And in Q4, we had some difficulty in our EMIP metals business, and that will continue into Q1 which is one reason why the Q1 forecast is lower than we would have liked. So, to get conviction, it's more difficult in this environment. And that's why I mentioned in my opening talk that with that sort of cloudy outlook, it's probably best to be conservative on the guidance that I gave.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then switching gears a bit just to the M&A that you announced.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","What are the EBITDA multiples and maybe margins now versus margin potential of these businesses. And what's your playbook for creating value on these deals?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, absolutely. The Brookfield deal, we paid about 11 times and the ESP deal we paid about 10 times. We see significant synergy with these businesses. If I look at the ESP deal, their margins are quite good. However, we can offer significant amounts of synergy in terms of international expansion. They don't do a lot outside the United States. And also, just our normal operational excellence initiatives can definitely create value.","Our goals and how we price these deals, we look for a 10% return on invested capital in year three. Both of these deals actually exceed that so we're pretty confident of getting a good return for our shareholders.","Following up on Brookfield, Brookfield is just a phenomenal company. Their name is well, well-known in the industry and it's almost synonymous with rheometers because they basically have a very, very strong position in that market. And their margins are lower than the AMETEK margins so we believe over time, we can definitely put our operational excellence capabilities in place there and move those margins up to the AMETEK average and possibly beyond.","So we're pretty excited about both of these deals. Obviously, doing deals is the primary use of our cash flow. And we're going to continue to make acquisitions throughout the year and we think it's a very significant value creator for our shareholders.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Please proceed.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Yeah. Morning. A couple of questions. First, with respect to EMG being down 8% organically in Q4, I would assume that sort of caught you by surprise. Can you talk about within EMIP or maybe even just walking through the other businesses in EMG, how much of the decline are you experiencing there that's really volume-driven versus price and\/or commodity deflation driven? And I guess, when do we anniversary that commodity deflation as it sort of flows through your P&L?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Matt. You're right. That was the surprise in the quarter. EIG came in essentially where we were expecting. But what happened during the Q4 is that there was a significant decline in metal prices. A few examples are nickel was down 13%. Copper just in the quarter was down 17%. And vanadium was down 23%.","Now, in terms of how that affects the profitability, we pass the commodity prices through so that there's not a major impact from the viewpoint that the prices came down from that perspective. The issue is that because the prices were coming down and so rapidly, our customers basically stopped purchasing. They wanted to make darn sure they were purchasing at the bottom instead of at a different \u2013 higher level. So the impact here was, therefore, on the sales line from the view point that they essentially stopped buying.","And that is continuing into Q1. We expect some stabilization in Q2. And I'm probably \u2013 a pretty sure bet would be by Q3 that those \u2013 that will stabilize because in essence those customers need the product. I mean that's the fundamental issue. So they'll drive their inventories down to where they're as low as they can be. And then they'll be forced to basically go ahead and purchase.","So I think that covered all of your questions, Matt.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Yeah. Thank you. And then one quick follow-up. Just on Oil & Gas, as you entered 2015, you threw out some numbers, I think, down 10%. Is that where it sort of ended up for you guys? You were able to sort of get that right, I guess? And then what are you looking at there for 2016 on an incremental downdraft basis and also pulled in how mid and downstream impact that as well as upstream?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Okay, Matt. We definitely got it right in 2015. We made that call right at the beginning of the year and in essence, when we look at the results for 2015, we hit it right on, which is almost unbelievable that we were able to call it as close as we did.","Looking forward, what we're expecting, if you look at the total linkage that we have to oil and gas is about $360 million. Of that, about a third is upstream, so say, $120 million, and we're projecting that piece to be down around a third, around 30% to 35% which is down an incremental $40 million. And then if you look at the remainder, which is mid- and downstream, we expect a mid single digit type decline. So overall, what's in our forecast is an incremental $50 million of decline due to essentially the price of oil being down at the $30 a barrel level right now.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great. Thanks a lot, Frank.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, you bet, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question. This has been a very confusing earnings period, I guess, for me. When was the last time outside of a recession you remember that your businesses sort of could not grow organically? And what are you guys just seeing on a broader economic sense because some companies are talking about things re-accelerating into the first half of the year? Just sort of, if you can take a longer historical perspective first and, b, just to talk about the fact that some people are sort of calling for re-acceleration and some people are not?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it depends on the particular markets in your particular business concentrations. I think if you look back historically where AMETEK has had, say, negative organic growth is typically when the industrial cycle is down. And in my view, we are in an industrial recession right now. That's the view that the consensus of all of our managers is that we are in an industrial recession. And therefore, to get any sizeable organic growth in this environment is challenging. And where AMETEK shines is that we're able to be very good on the cost side of the business and therefore, we are looking to be able to hold or slightly increase our earnings in a recessionary environment.","So that's probably the best I can say and if companies \u2013 I'll give you some examples without specific names, but if you have a company that doesn't have oil and gas exposure or doesn't have a lot of exposure in Asia or in metals areas, those companies are going to have a better opportunity to grow organically and that's probably why you're hearing some of this, I'll call it, confusion in the market.","When we step back and we look at these kind of environments, we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business and we're going to look to deploy capital to increase our earnings. And remember, the guidance that I'm giving does not include any future acquisitions. So whatever we can do to deploy more capital and bring more companies into our realm. We've got the operating capability that we've shown over many, many years and over a period of time, we always create value. As a matter of fact, the way I view this environment right now is this is a buying opportunity for AMETEK. We very seldom have a dip like our stock is experiencing right now. And I can tell you, I'm going to increase my ownership. So that shows some commitment.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just to follow-up on that, I had breakfast today with somebody a lot smarter than I am. And the question was about sustainability of this M&A driven model versus 10 years ago and I know what you think, but it's interesting that this earnings season, the companies that have disappointed investor expectations actually where these sort of high quality companies with heavy emphasis on M&A model. What do you think about your actual ability to reaccelerate M&A in this environment?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's super. I think what we're going to see because we're in this slowness in the industrial economy is we're going to see a lot more properties becoming available. There will be an exodus of companies where they want to sell because they don't want to wait out until market conditions get better. And we have the capital, we have the management talent. So to me, it's one of the two pillars in terms of buying companies right now. I think we'll see the multiples start to come down. As a matter of fact, I heard Bill Eginton in a recent board meeting, first time say he's seeing multiples start to come down. So that's a good sign as well.","So we're going to be aggressive. You take advantage of this on the acquisition side, and you focus on cost. There isn't a lot you can do about the global macro. So you just \u2013 you sort of have to wait that out. And when they come back, the earnings of this company are going to skyrocket. So I mean, that's the best way I can describe the situation. I know it's difficult for all of us, including yourselves, to really get a handle on exactly what's happening. But that always happens in a recessionary environment. I hope that helps you.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much. No, this is great. Thank you.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Radigan with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Joe.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Frank, just to follow up on that M&A comment you made. Looking back at how active you were on the acquisition front last cycle, you closed a lot of deals in 2008. That was just ahead of the downturn. And then 2009 was one of your lightest years in terms of deal flow. Does that make you at all hesitant to get overly aggressive right now ahead of perhaps a worsening macro outlook? Or maybe you can be more opportunistic? I mean, it doesn't sound like it, but what are your thoughts there?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the downturn in 2008 and 2009 was clearly an abnormality. And the reason is that the whole economy was just crashing. Everybody just stopped is the best way of saying it. And because nobody knew where bottom was and, I mean, that was a different kind of recession probably than I've experienced in my business career. So, yes, your historical picture is exactly right.","However, this recession what I'm saying we're in now is different. It's not as deep start there. And I think in 2008 and 2009, I don't remember the actual numbers, but I think we were down about 15% or something of that magnitude. We came back. We came back very strong right after that. But this is not of that magnitude and you can see that in our guidance where we're talking about organic growth for 2016 being just down low-single digits. So it's not anywhere near a significant an issue. So I would not use that as a model.","Actually, if you go back to the previous recession, before that, we did buy companies in that downturn. So that's why I think this is just an ideal opportunity to be aggressive. And I don't mean aggressive in the sense of buying companies that are not good. I mean we've got the capital and we've got the manpower. And, I don't know, we're going to continue to look at companies. We're actually pretty happy that already this year, we've announced deployment of about $300 million in capital.","And as I said in my opening comments, over the last 24 months, we deployed $1.1 billion in capital. So I think it's going to continue. And I can't sit there and tell you exactly what we're going to acquire and what the capital outlays are going to be. I'm just telling you from a strategic view point, it's a good time. That's probably the best way that I can characterize it.","So Joe, I don't know if that helps with your question.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah. No, that's helpful. Thanks, Frank. And then in terms of your outlook, the low-single-digit organic growth, how do you see that between segments and \u2013 maybe it makes sense to do the business rundown in terms of what you're seeing in the segments or what you saw in the quarter and then rolling that up into the guidance?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure. I'd be glad to do that, Joe. So let me start with EIG and Aerospace, EIG Aerospace had a strong fourth quarter, with organic sales up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, reflecting strength. And, actually, all parts of that business, commercial OEM, business and regional jets, and our military business, believe it or not.","Our EIG Aerospace business had an excellent year as they gained sizable new content on a number of attractive platforms. In 2015, they received a record $620 million in life of program awards on 35 different platforms and that included Rolls-Royce for the Trent 7000 engine on the A330neo; Parker Hannifin, for fuel systems on the Joint Strike Fighter; and GE for the GE9X engine, which will be on the new version of 777. So they've done a really, really good job of getting content. Of course, when you're on these airplanes, that content lasts for 20, 25 years.","So looking to 2016, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up low- to mid-single digits and that's why the continued ramp-up of key commercial OEM platforms and some growth in business and regional jets mainly due to our content on new aircraft and, in particular, the HondaJet.","Moving to our process, organic sales and process were down mid-single digits in the quarter, obviously, driven by weakness in upstream oil and gas. As I mentioned a moment ago, the weakness in upstream Oil & Gas in 2015 was in line with our expectations at the start of the year. And for 2016, we expect sales for our process instruments to be down low to mid-single digits organically, driven by continued weakness across upstream Oil & Gas.","The last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. Their organic sales were flat versus last year's fourth quarter with solid growth in our Programmable Power and Solid State Controls business offsetting weakness in our Power Instruments business. And also, for this business, in 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down low- to mid-single digits.","So then if you look at all of EIG where you got Aerospace up and both Process and Power & Industrial down slightly, if we then look across all EIG, we expect organic sales to be down there, low to mid single digits, with overall sales up low single digits really due to the acquisition of Surface Vision, Brookfield, and ESP\/SurgeX, with obviously these last two deals being announced this morning. So that's our outlook for EIG.","Moving now to EMG, and I'll start with the differentiated part of EMG. Organic sales here were down mid single digits in the quarter driven, as we have talked about, by weakness in our Engineered Materials Interconnects & Packaging business. And this is again a result of the commodity price deflation that I talked about. And for 2016, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to actually be flat organically with the impact from commodity deflation within our metals business being mostly pronounced in the first half of 2016 which is again what I said in answer to one of the questions.","And then the last part of EMG is Floorcare & Specialty Motors, they were down actually mid-teens organically in the fourth quarter as a result of softer demand globally. But we actually have a pretty good outlook for that business. We expect the sales for the business to be roughly flat organically. We've won some content on new programs, and our managers are doing a great job managing that business. So that is the present outlook. So if you sum that up for EMG, overall sales are going to be up low single digits, just like EIG. And in this case, it's driven by the acquisition of Global Tubes on the acquisition side. And for organic sales, we expect to be down low single digits.","And that, if you roll up then to answer your question for AMETEK as a whole, we're expecting overall sales could be up low single digits and organic sales to be down low single digits. That's our best call at the present time. And if I can give you some flavor on our guidance, our guidance assumes these organic growth numbers that I just talked about. And the reason I pushed a little bit to the lower end is that I don't see as much upside on organic growth as possibly we could have some downside and that's just because of the fogginess right now of the environment. It's the best way that I can say it. And I'm trying to be accurate and tell you what my best thoughts are.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I appreciate that. Thanks, Frank.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Frank, could you provide us with the order number in the quarter?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Orders were down 4%. It was $966 million. Do I have it right, guys? $966 million.","Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I got it right. And I'm not looking at anything.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And what's the \u2013 can you give us a sense of the core order number?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Core was down 6%.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","6%? Okay. And then also, it appears that at the midpoint of guidance for 2016, if I kind of walk up the P&L, midpoint of EPS guidance, I walk up the P&L.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","It looks like maybe the EBIT margin is around 23%, maybe at the midpoint?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're projecting EBIT margins at the midpoint to be up 20 basis points to 30 basis points even though it's going to be weaker obviously in the first part of the year. But obviously, we are putting those cost improvements that I talked about through the business, and they will have a greater impact obviously on the second half than the first half. So, overall, we're talking 20 basis points to 30 basis points up.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. And just maybe the last question, could you just give us \u2013 and maybe this is just \u2013 on the Aerospace business for 2016, just kind of the four components there. Are all of that, all of the components, third-party service, defense, commercial and bizjet, is there any difference there? Are they all kind of up low-single, up mid-single? Anything on the...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's true. Your statement is very accurate and you look at \u2013 the surprise here, and I've said this before is that our military business is actually doing quite well. Some of that is not U.S. military. It's outside military, outside the U.S., and that's doing quite well. As I mentioned, business in regional jets, the market is not recovering. At some point, it will. People have been projecting an upturn there for the last five years, probably, and it hasn't happened. But we've won really good content on \u2013 in that segment. So we're thinking that one will be okay.","And then commercial, the key there is the new aircraft. And we had very good content on the new aircraft. And so we see that, yeah, I think your basic comment of low to mid-single digits is accurate.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. And then just last thought, I understand that commodities pass-through pricing. But exclusive of that EMIP business, were you able to capture any pricing in the fourth quarter and would you expect positive price capture in 2016?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In that business, the answer would be no.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Correct. Yeah.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Because one of the advantages and disadvantage of pass-through is when prices go down, customers \u2013 we pass that through. And then when they go up, just the reverse happens. So you sort of can't have it both ways. And so there will not be anything from that viewpoint. But as people start seeing metal prices go up, they're going to refill their inventories, and you're going to have a recovery of the impacts that we're seeing right now.","So I mean, the dynamic is more in the customer buying pattern due to price than it is in terms of the inflation effect on our P&L. Does that make sense, Rick?","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's okay. But the question is maybe a little bit around outside of that business. Are you seeing any...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh. Okay.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","...competitive pricing outside of that business?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh. Okay. I am sorry. I misinterpreted your question.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. That's okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Okay. No. Let me give you some data. In the fourth quarter, for the whole company now, price minus inflation was about 0.2%. Price was about 1%, inflation, on everything now. I'm including wages, everything, all in, was about 0.8%, so that we got 0.2% of sales to the bottom line in the fourth quarter.","What's in my guidance and in our guidance, I should say, is that price minus inflation will be flat.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And again, we're looking at the global macro. And we're just not going to assume that we're going to get any pricing above inflation. But we have a lot of pressure on our operating managers to, at a minimum, cover inflation and maybe we'll end up with some positive there. But that's what's included in the guidance, Rick.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. This is Drew on for Nigel.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Drew.","Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Frank, just going back to the orders real quick. I think in 3Q, you had mentioned that sequentially the orders have actually picked up from July through September. Could you just give us a sense for how things tracked through 4Q? And then what you're seeing in January to-date because we're hearing some commentary that, from some distributors that things are picking up?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Through the quarter, actually, our orders did go up. So we had a very strong last month in the quarter. So that trend was definitely there for all of AMETEK. And that also is during this time when I was mentioning the impacts of deflation.","I would say in January, no, I have not seen a pickup. But, it's hard to conclude anything from that because our orders tend to be weaker in the first month in a quarter than the third month. But I can clearly tell you, I'm not sitting here with a euphoric outlook that things are getting better.","Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just one more on the \u2013 regarding your comments on still wanting to be aggressive on M&A and valuations potentially coming in. Do you have a target or sort of a max level on leverage that you'd be willing to step up to?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Leverage is just not an issue for us. You look at where we stand right now, and our net debt to EBITDA is around 32%. It's up a little bit from last year. Our debt to EBITDA was at 1.8 times. We could easily lever up to 2.5 times, which is a significant amount of capital deployment and remain investment grade. And so we would never go to the point where we are not investment grade.","So capital and leverage is not the determinant in our acquisition strategy. It's finding really good businesses like the two we announced this morning. And we just have the capital to deploy and I just don't have to worry about leverage.","I mean, just to give you another statistic with the budget or the guidance I gave you. The operating cash flow of AMETEK will be about $800 million. Our capital deployment, as Bob indicated in his talk, is going to be in the $70 million, $75 million region. So the free cash flow, and I don't know whether your percentage was in there, Bob, it's about 119% of net income.","So you can just see that the cash flow of the company is incredible, and that's why acquisitions are very important because we think that's the best utilization of capital to get you a good return.","Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Very helpful. Thanks.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, I just wanted to touch a little bit more on the guidance, especially just with Q1. I know you talked about the deflationary impact on the order trends and presumably the margins with overhead absorption, but, I mean, it does seem like it's \u2013 the margin does come down even a couple hundred basis points year-over-year. And then just kind of talking about the comment with margins for the year up 20 basis points to 30 basis points. You have to have a pretty good level of expansion by the back half. Am I actually reading that correctly? And if there is any commentary on the trajectory? Thank you so much.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Your reading is definitely correct and when we look at the first quarter, there's the oil and gas market, our business. We were depleting backlog last year which obviously it's been now down at a low level. So, when you look at first quarter-over-quarter, you're going to have an impact there plus this material deflation issue that we've talked extensively about.","So the first quarter is going to be tough and that's the reason why we decided \u2013 we saw this coming obviously. And that's why we decided to do the restructuring or realignment, I should say, where we put a major cost savings through the P&L. And, obviously, we're not going to get significant benefit from that in the first quarter. And, yes, as we go through the quarters, that is going to have a sizable impact.","And there's another factor in here, too, and that's that the comps get easier as you go forward, too, overall. So, you get a little leverage from the sales line. But your outlook and your high-level thought process is right on.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks. And just separately on the restructuring. So the payback seems particularly high. I think it was 150% conversion with the math you provided. Can you just talk about why the payback really is so good? Is there something specific about what you're doing that is just that productive?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I would say this is somewhat normal for us, this kind of payback. And I'll give you a high-level view that we're obviously going to do some employment reductions. It's not major but definitely we're going to be doing some, and we're going to be closing some plants. And I don't want to talk about the particulars, but this is standard AMETEK, I would say, where we are able to continue that operational excellence capability that we have. So, yeah, you look at the returns whenever we do this and they're usually very, very good.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","If I could sneak one last in? Just on the RD&E. So you're keeping that fairly consistent. Can you talk about where you see particular opportunities to kind of improve the product line and essentially kind of extend your capabilities?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No. That's a good point. I mean, we're basically going to invest, as I said in my opening talk, $210 million. That's up about 5% from last year. And it also just coincidentally happens to be about 5% of sales. So it's a very healthy number. And we feel this is the organic pipeline of the company. That investment will go more in EIG than it will in EMG. And I can give you some examples of where we're going to be putting that investment in.","I mentioned in my opening talk that UPT is doing extremely well. This is a high-end measurement company. It did not have substantial exposure to some of the things that we have talked about on the negative side. And they're going to continue to invest. You may recall a while back we did the Creaform acquisition. That company has been just superlative in terms of organic growth. I mean, they're growing at numbers in the 15%, 20% region. These are basically instruments that can very accurately look at an object and convert it to a computer, basically a CAD-type of drawing just by waving the instrument across an object. And very, very good marketplace and we're going to continue to invest in that business.","And we're also not afraid to invest in some of the markets that are down. If you look some of our businesses that are in oil and gas, probably more in the mid and down area of oil and gas. We'll probably invest more there. And we'll continue to invest in Power & Industrial and I gave some examples of some of the products in my opening talk. So the focus on engineering investment is going to be higher in EIG. The focus on capital deployment will be higher in EMG because those businesses require more capital to grow. So, that's sort of the view of how we're going to invest. Hope that helps.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","If Okay. Yeah, that's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please proceed.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Robert.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, I guess a couple of cleanups given the time on a day. I guess, the first question, you may have said this but I was transferring to another call. Were the close of these deals contemporaneous like in January? Or when was the close of these most recent deals?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. They were right after the first of the year. I mean...","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have been working on them obviously through the fourth quarter. But both closed right after the first of the year.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I decided to just couple them and get it all out at once in essence.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. And obviously, rhetorical question, but clearly that's included in the guidance for the full year of 2016 because they've been closed and they're under reported numbers.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That is correct.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Okay. And then just in terms of the general M&A environment right now, I mean, I guess one thing \u2013 obviously the organic environment is very challenging, as you've alluded to, and there's a lot of volatility in kind of not only your businesses but also implicitly in your outlook, as a result. But I guess, thinking about acquisitions in this environment, there could be a real disconnect between bid and ask because sellers' expectations have to get reset further, one would think. And so do you think you could be in a period of a little bit of an air pocket here as kind of seller expectations get kind of reset around kind of their order backlog, their performance? And how do you think about that in what is a dynamic environment?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think you're right that there has to be a reset here. I mean, multiples have been quite high. But as I mentioned to one of the questions, in answer to one of the questions, basically, we're starting to see that now. We're already seeing those multiples come down. Sellers are going to be more realistic. And if you're a seller, you're sitting there and you're saying, either I sell now or I don't want to sell during the downturn. You either sell now or you wait. And that, obviously, depends on the particulars of the given seller.","We have examples of \u2013 I'm just going back historically now where many family-type businesses just decide at this point that let's do it now instead of waiting. So you do see that dynamic. And it's \u2013 right now, we feel pretty good that we're going to be able to close some more deals. We feel very good what we've recently done. But I can't sit here and tell you, it's going to be this or that. And that's the goal, et cetera. It's more that, if we can find some good deals, we're going to execute. That's the bottom line.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Now, Frank, one last question I'll let you go is...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","...basically the following. In this environment, does this make you rethink kind of your time line around transition and management transition, do you want to leave in a volatile environment or would you extend your kind of tenure to just kind of get through the cycle? I mean, how do you think about that in terms of succession?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would not even tie where we are to the transition. That's just not a factor in our thought process, my thought process or the board's thought process. So the transition here is going extremely well. Dave is doing a phenomenal job as a Chief Operating Officer. And the debate here is between the board and my wife.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As to when I decide. But as I've told you, the transition here will be most likely that I will become Executive Chair, and spend a little bit more time in Florida, and whomever we decide, most likely Dave, obviously, who will take over, they will be dealing obviously with all of the day-to-day issues.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","The wife always wins. Thanks.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know. I got a strong board.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Hello?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Hi.","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Bhupender. A little bit louder.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Could you \u2013 yeah, we can't hear you.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Can you hear me now?","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah. We could hear you. Go ahead.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Frank, can you give us a rundown of sales by region?","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Sorry, Bhupender, you broke up there. We couldn't hear that question.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Can you get closer?","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Can you give us a rundown by region?","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. Geographic rundown?","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Yes.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. I can do that. I'll do the organically. We talked about the total company being down 4%. The U.S. was down 5%. Asia was down 4% and Europe was down 1%.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","And could you talk about China? How much of that was within Asia?","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Say that one more time, Bhupender? We couldn't catch that.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Could you talk about China?","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","China. Okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","China, yeah. China was the driver in that minus 4% down in Asia. China was actually down organically, about 15%. So, obviously, that weighed on us. But on the other side, India did incredibly well. They were up well into the double-digits. But China was weak, no question. Everything you hear about China, at least, and the impact on our business is pretty consistent.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Now, I think you can hear me clearly.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, yeah. Now, we can hear you.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So, I'll make sure you hear this. So the other question on the operating excellence of $120 million for 2016. How should we be thinking about that with the \u2013 taking into consideration the midpoint of the guidance? Just give us some color on that $120 million. You said $60 million coming from the global sourcing and procurement? And is that a very conservative number? I mean, usually, the history is like, you guys, actually, kind of up that up as it go through the year. And I just, Frank, if you can?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. The $120 million is a number that would reflect the midpoint of our guidance. And I think, it's reasonable to assume that we can improve that number possibly as we go through the year. So there could be definitely some upside that could come from the cost reduction side. No question.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And lastly, on the M&A, we have been talking about here on the call. Just remind us what's your sweet spot in terms of the size of the deals and what's in the pipeline right now.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, the deal size, we like to do is up to a couple hundred million dollars in sales. That doesn't preclude us from doing something larger. But we have found if we keep the deal size below that $200 million sales number, we typically can get extremely strong synergy with those deals. And therefore, the return on invested capital is excellent. Also, with those smaller deals, the multiples tend to be lower so that you're not paying quite as much as you will for a larger deal.","So I would say that sweet spot is in that sort of $75 million to $200 million area in terms of sales. And when I look at the backlog, we have a fair number of deals that are in our backlog that fit that size range. We also have some deals that are larger, and we also have some deals that are smaller. But that is the sweet spot.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen Group. Please proceed.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, guys.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for running late here to get everybody. Frank, I think I even asked you this last quarter. You talk about Floorcare as being the real economic tale, those kind of products for you guys. And you mentioned I think minus 14% for the quarter. And your outlook for next year looks pretty positive, but the way you said it, it kind of sounded like that's an AMETEK-specific thing and not a market-specific thing with new products and things that you guys have done specifically. So can you maybe talk about that market in context of your broader economic evaluation?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No. I mean, I think the broader market is definitely a factor in this business. And the reason that we're talking that we think it's going to be better next year than it was in the fourth quarter is that, yeah, this is not a major part of AMETEK overall. But fundamentally, we saw some inventory realignments in the fourth quarter with our customers and that's going to bleed through, in a positive sense, as we go into next year.","So I would say that the Floorcare business is just consistent with the macro outlook that I've provided. And the people who are running this business have just done a superb job and the profitability has done very, very well. So, this is, actually, not going to be a major issue. At least, that's our feeling right now in 2016.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you. And then just two quick clean-up ones for me. On the two deals you announced, I know you said they're contemplated in guidance, did you say how much of an impact you're expecting in 1Q or for the full-year for those? And then last on, I was wondering if there's anything we should be thinking about, any impact from Boeing 747 production cut and how that might apply to you guys?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. On your first question, there is not a substantial impact for the year or in the first quarter. In our guidance, actually, there are some costs that are going through the first quarter, which is included in our guidance, and there's about a $0.005 of costs that are going through the P&L. And as we go through the year, we'll probably recapture that cost downside, but there is not a substantial EPS positive in 2016, we're going to see the impacts will be more in 2017 from an EPS viewpoint.","And in terms of some of the announcements around Boeing, if you look at the outlook for Boeing for 2016, their total builds are going to be down about 2%, but offsetting that, Airbus is going to be up about 2%. So if you look at the total commercial build, it's roughly flat.","However, if you look at the new aircraft, those are growing at a very, very nice rate, and we have significant content on the new aircraft. And in particular, Airbus. If you look at historically, AMETEK has much more \u2013 have had much more content on Boeing aircraft, but with the new aircraft that Airbus is bringing to the market, we now have sizable content on those aircraft. And therefore, our projections are higher than that total bill rates for all aircraft because of the new aircraft in our content list.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for that color.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All righty.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Sorry. Just two quick things. I mean, one is, what kind of \u2013 maybe Kevin, what FX impact do you have built into the 2016 revenue guide?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, no impact.","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","No impact.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","None?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're basically saying it's flat.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just last. Frank, could you just talk about last couple of quarters here, we've bought back a fair amount of stock. And I'm just trying to reconcile that with the commentary around the M&A pipeline and maybe expectations. So for deal flow here going forward, do we kind of back off on the stock buyback then in 2016 or...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We know we've done a little bit in the fourth quarter. I would expect we would do some in 2016. But to your point, it's not the primary use of our cash flow.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","The primary use of our cash flow is for M&A.

I\u2019ll now turn the meeting over to Frank.","Frank Hermance","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone.  Ametek had a solid fourth quarter to complete another outstanding year.  We established quarterly and annual records for orders, sales, operating income, operating, margins, net income, diluted EPS, and operating cash flow.  In addition, we acquired seven highly strategic businesses in 2012, establishing records for capital deployed and annual revenue acquired.  For the full year 2012, sales were up 12%, operating income was up 17%, operating margins expanded 100 basis points to 22.4%, and diluted EPS ended at $1.88, a 19% increase over 2011\u2019s diluted EPS.  ","In the fourth quarter, orders were very strong, increasing 28% in total and 4% organically.  The core order trend within the quarter was positive with December being very strong.  The book-to-bill ratio was 1.14.  Sales in the quarter were up 10% to $841.8 million.  Internal sales growth was down 2% while acquisitions added 13% and foreign currency translation was a one point headwind.","Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 13% to $190 million from $167.4 million last year, reflecting the impact from our operational excellence activities.  Operating income margin in the fourth quarter was a record 22.6%, a 70 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2011.  Net income was up 18% to $119.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.49 were up 17% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter.  Operating cash flow was excellent with both the fourth quarter and full-year results representing records.  Operating cash flow was $192 million in the fourth quarter and $611 million for the year, up 25% and 20% respectively.","Free cash flow was 140% of net income in the fourth quarter and 121% of net income for the full year.  Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was over $1.1 billion, an all-time record high.  Working capital management was excellent and operating working capital was 17.5% of sales.  ","Before turning our attention to the individual operating groups, I would like to provide some perspective on the global macroeconomic environment.  Overall, we saw a continued sluggish global macro environment.  Customers delayed shipments in the quarter as a result of general economic uncertainty.  Despite the slightly weaker than expected core sales growth in the quarter, the overall orders and order trends during the quarter were excellent.  As is evident in our results, we are able to deliver exceptional operating performance and exceed our earnings estimates despite this weak macro environment.","As we have demonstrated in the past, we will continue to aggressively manage our costs through this period of softness while continuing to make investments in strategic acquisitions, market expansion, and new product development initiatives.  In particular, our deal pipeline is strong and we will remain active in acquiring businesses.","Now turning to the individual operating groups, the electronic instruments group had a strong fourth quarter with tremendous operating performance.  For the quarter, sales were up 12% to a record $494.5 million on solid core growth in our upstream oil and gas and commercial aerospace businesses, plus the contributions from the acquisitions of O\u2019Brien and Micro-Poise.  Internal growth was down 1%, acquisitions added 14%, and foreign currency translation was a one point headwind.  EIG\u2019s operating income increased 16% to $134.9 million and operating margins were up 100 basis points over last year\u2019s fourth quarter to a record 27.3%, reflecting the excellent work from our business teams.","The electromechanical group also had a good quarter.  Sales were up 8% to $347.2 million on solid core growth in our precision motion control business and the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition.  Internal growth was down 4%, acquisitions added 13%, and foreign currency was a one point headwind.  EMG\u2019s operating income increased 5% to $65.2 million and operating margins were 18.8%.  Excluding the impact of the Dunkermotoren acquisition, EMG\u2019s operating margins would have been 19.8%, up 40 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2011.","Now turning to our four growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development, and acquisitions.  Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company.  Our focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success.  The results we announced today reflect the tremendous impact of our various operational excellence initiatives as we were able to expand operating margins 70 basis points in the fourth quarter to a record 22.6%.  Operational excellence includes lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back office operations, design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, and the movement of production to low cost locales.  ","Through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement activities, we recognized $14 million in savings in the fourth quarter and $49 million in savings for all of 2012.  Overall, we realized $85 million in total cost savings in 2012 through our operational excellence initiatives.  Both the global sourcing and overall operational excellence savings for 2012 exceeded the guidance we provided at the end of the third quarter.  Looking forward for 2013, we expect approximately $85 million in total cost savings through our operational excellence initiatives, including $50 million in savings from our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives.  ","Global and market expansion continues to be a driver for Ametek\u2019s growth.  In the fourth quarter, international sales represented 52% of our total sales.  This is an increase from 50% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2011.  We continued to make international investments to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities, and manufacturing footprint in order to position our business to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities.  ","Ametek\u2019s advanced measurement and technology division has been awarded a multi-million dollar contract to deliver Ortek\u2019s new Detective SPM spectroscopic portal monitors as the primary radiation and nuclear threat inspection solution for Abu Dhabi\u2019s new flagship, state-of-the-art maritime port.  The Detective SPM portal monitoring system is a modular solution that detects, identifies and locates fissionable nuclear material \u2013 that\u2019s material that you can build a nuclear bomb from.  The Ametek system incorporates the commercially-available IDM 200, the latest addition to its Detective family of high resolution radiation identifiers for homeland security.","New product development is a key to our long-term health and growth.  We have consistently invested in RD&E.  In 2012, we spent 155 million, which was up 13% from 2011.  In 2013, we expect to spend 172 million, an 11% increase over 2012.  We\u2019re excited about some recent product introductions.  Ametek Aerospace and Defense has been selected by Snecma to provide pressure sensors and transducers for the newly developed Leap 1B engines that will be used to power the Boeing 737 Max.  Ametek sensors and fluid management systems will provide the oil filter differential pressure sensor and the oil and temperature transducers.  The value of the contract is estimated to be $35 million over the life of this program.  Ametek Aerospace was previously awarded contracts to provide heat exchangers and sensors for the Leap 1A and Leap 1C engines being developed by Snecma for the Airbus A320 Neo and Comac C919.  The total value of those contracts was $175 million over the life of the program.","Ametek\u2019s precision motion control division recently introduced high performance brushless DC motors which are slotless and used for medical applications requiring precision motion control such as high speed surgical instruments and dental tools.  As the medical industry trends away from pneumatic devices in favor of DC motors, the industry requires a new level of performance from these motors.  Ametek\u2019s high performance brushless DC motors offer a number of benefits that make them especially suitable for demanding medical applications, including small size, high-speed performance, little or no EMI emissions, long life, and low audible noise.  From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 22% of sales in 2012, up from 20% the prior year, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers.  ","Turning our attention now to acquisitions, we had a record year for acquisitions in 2012.  We acquired an excellent set of highly differentiated businesses that expanded our market opportunities and technology base in the area of precision motion control, high-end analytical instrumentation, cryogenic cooling, and aerospace MRO.  For the year, we acquired seven businesses, deployed approximately $750 million in capital, and acquired approximately $450 million in annual revenue.  ","In the fourth quarter, we acquired five businesses:  Micro-Poise, which we acquired in October and highlighted during our third party conference call, and four small technology acquisitions in December.  I will provide a brief overview of the technology acquisitions.","In mid-December, we acquired Aero Components International and Avtech Avionics and Instruments, both privately-held providers of third party MRO services for the global aerospace market.  Both businesses are based in Miami. Aero Components and Avtech are strategically important as they provide Ametek with worldwide fuel repair capabilities and next generation avionics capabilities, both key technology gaps in our global MRO portfolio.  These acquisitions are consistent with our stated strategy to expand our global third party aerospace MRO repair capabilities organically and through small targeted acquisitions.","Also in mid-December, we acquired Sunpower, a leader in the design and development of high reliability sterling cryocoolers and externally heated sterling engines for medical, scientific, telecommunications, and space applications.  Sunpower\u2019s cryogenic cooling technology provides a critical enabling technology for use in our highly success Ortek Detective family of portable radiation identifiers.  It also provides a technology platform to support the continued growth of this product family.  Sunpower will become part of our advanced measurement technology division.","And lastly, we closed the year with the acquisition of Crystal Engineering on December 31.  Crystal Engineering provides Ametek with key pressure measurement technology as well as high-end portable digital calibration instruments which nicely complement Ametek\u2019s test and calibration instruments businesses.  Crystal strengthens our technology and product offerings in the calibration instrument market while it\u2019s product line benefits from the global reach and resources of the electronic instruments group.  Crystal will become part of Ametek\u2019s measurement and calibration technologies division.","Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2013 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value.  We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus.  Our backlog of deals is excellent, our balance sheet is strong, and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy.","Turning now to the outlook for 2013, we expect our businesses overall to show solid growth during 2013 with our longer cycle oil and gas, power, and aerospace businesses showing particular strength.  We anticipate organic growth to accelerate throughout the year with the second half stronger than the first half.  Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2013.  ","We anticipate 2013 revenue to be up high single digits on a percentage basis from 2012.  Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid single digits for all of Ametek and for both operating groups.  Earnings for 2013 are expected to be in the range of $2.07 to $2.12 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% over 2012, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, our operational excellence initiatives, and the benefits and contributions from recent acquisitions.  First quarter 2013 sales are expected to be up approximately 10% from last year\u2019s first quarter.  We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.49 to $0.51 per diluted share in the first quarter, up 9% to 13% over last year\u2019s first quarter.  ","So in summary, our overall businesses performed very well in the fourth quarter and in 2012, producing records for essentially all key financial metrics.  Although the macroeconomic conditions created a more challenging environment in 2012 than expected, we were able to deliver exceptional operating results through a focus on executing our growth strategies.  We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy.  In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizeable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth.","Bob Mandos will now cover some of the financial details, and then we\u2019ll be glad to take your questions.  Bob?","Robert Mandos","Thank you, Frank.  As Frank noted, we had a strong fourth quarter with excellent operating performance.  I will provide some further details.","In the quarter, total selling expenses were up less than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost containment.  General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales, below last year\u2019s fourth quarter level of 1.5% of sales driven primarily by lower compensation and consulting spend in this year\u2019s fourth quarter.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.8%, down from last year\u2019s fourth quarter rate of 30.7%.  The full year tax rate was 30.7% versus last year\u2019s rate of 30.9%, and in line with our expectations.  For 2013, we expect our tax rate to be between 30 and 31%.  As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year rate.  ","On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 17.5% of sales in the fourth quarter.  This near-record low level of working capital positions Ametek as one of the top performers in our peer group and is a direct reflection of the tremendous strides our business units have taken in driving towards operating excellence.  Strong working capital management will remain a key priority.  ","Capital spending was $24 million for the quarter and $57 million for the full year.  Full-year 2012 capital expenditures were 1.7% of sales.  2013 capital expenditures are expected to be about $65 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $28 million for the quarter and $105 million for the full year.  2013 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $118 million.  Our cash flow was excellent in the quarter and for the full year.  Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and full year were records.  In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $192 million, up 25% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter; and full-year operating cash flow of $611 million was up 20% over 2011.  ","Free cash flow was $167 million for the fourth quarter, representing 140% of net income.  For the full year, free cash flow was $553 million, approximately 121% of net income, continuing our strong free cash flow generation.  Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy where we expended approximately $750 million on transactions in 2012.  ","Total debt was $1.45 billion at December 31, up $190 million from 2011 year-end.  Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $156 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at December 31 of 34%, down slightly from 35% at the end of 2011.  At December 31, we had approximately $710 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives.  Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.","In summary, we had an outstanding 2012, establishing records essentially for all the key financial metrics.  We are well positioned for further growth both organically and through acquisitions with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.  ","Frank Hermance","Great, thank you, Bob.  That concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll now open it up for questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  [Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.  Please proceed with your question.","Allison Poliniak \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi guys, good morning.  Just touching on the order trends, Frank, obviously you talked about the process in December being actually surprisingly stronger.  Were the orders\u2014I guess the strength in orders weighted towards one industry or a few industries that you can talk about?","Frank Hermance","Well, it was pretty broad-based if you actually look at some of the key drivers.  The process businesses were particularly strong.  The power businesses were particularly strong, and surprisingly our floor care business was also very strong.  Aerospace on a quarter-over-quarter basis was not as strong as the three I just indicated, but that was because we had a very, very strong Q4 of last year.  So the order trends in the quarter were surprisingly strong.","Allison Poliniak \u2013 Wells Fargo","","Great.  And then as you look into \u201913, obviously a lot of uncertainty out there, and you mentioned the areas where you\u2019re expecting to see strength.  But are there any areas that are still weak now that you\u2019re starting to get the sense might be turning the corner as we head out into \u201913 at this point?","Frank Hermance","Yeah, it\u2019s a great question, Allison.  I would say the key factor is probably geographic in nature where if you look at the fourth quarter, organic growth and sales for the Far East was not that strong, but orders were.  So I think we are definitely starting to see a turn in Asia and in particular in China.  Now, it will take a few more months to verify that trend, but when you read the fact that China is in fact improving, their PMI was better recently, that\u2019s a key factor for us because we\u2019ve got about 18 to 20% of our sales in that part of the world.  So that\u2019s probably a key factor in how well we\u2019re going to do from an organic viewpoint next year.","As you I think are aware, in Europe, although that\u2019s probably one of the weakest global areas, our business tends to outperform because we\u2019ve got aerospace businesses there that perform very well, and we also roll up the oil and gas business from the Middle East in our European results.  So when you look at Europe, we tend to outperform.","So that\u2019s probably the best way to look at it, Allison.","Allison Poliniak \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great.  Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell from Citi Research.  Please proceed with your question.","Matt McConnell \u2013 Citi","","Thank you very much.  On the quarter specifically, could you give a little more insight into the several end markets in EMG where customers turned cautious; and then what are your assumptions for whether that caution persists into the start of the year?  And maybe along with that, what\u2019s the first quarter of \u201913 organic revenue growth assumption?","Frank Hermance","Yeah, sure.  Why don\u2019t I just walk through EMG and give you a perspective of sort of what happened in the fourth quarter and how we see it going into 2013.  As you know, in EMG we break that business down into differentiated and cost-driven motors.  If you look at the differentiated side of that business, for all of 2012 our differentiated businesses perform quite well really on strength in our precision motion control and military businesses.  If you look at the quarter, overall sales were up 10% driven by the contributions from the Dunkermotoren acquisition and strength in our core precision motion control business.  Organic sales in the differentiated side were actually down mid-single digits in the quarter; and as I mentioned in my opening comments, we saw customers actually delay shipments across several parts of the differentiated business.  And in particular answer to your question, our EMIP division, which has specialty metals types of focus, was one of those areas; and the other was our third party MRO business in aerospace.  As we went through the quarter, we saw push-outs but the order trend was good, so it\u2019s kind of a mixed message from that viewpoint.  So looking ahead to 2013, we expect these differentiated EMG businesses to be up approximately 10% with organic growth up mid-single digits, so we do think the trends are going to get better.  ","Looking at the other side, the cost-driven motors organic growth in the fourth quarter was actually flat for the cost-driven motor business, but actually that was the best organic growth of the year for that business and that strength came out of North America.  For 2013, we expect this business to be approximately flat.","Specifically with respect to your question around the first quarter, what we\u2019re assuming is sales to be up approximately 10%, and what we have budgeted is a flat core sales growth.  I\u2019m hoping that things are going to get better and we\u2019re going to exceed that in the first quarter, but given some of these push-outs we saw in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve decided to take a conservative view of the first quarter.  But we have good reason to believe that as we go through the year, things will improve.  As I mentioned in Allison\u2019s question, or my answer to Allison\u2019s question, Asia in particular seems to be an improving trend, and also aerospace, as the OEMs increase their build rates, we see that improving through the year.  It\u2019s very strong now but we see it even getting better as the year goes on, and we think that will be a driver to our performance.","So does that answer your question?","Matt McConnell \u2013 Citi","","Absolutely, that\u2019s very helpful.  Thank you.  And if I could just follow up on the 2013 guidance, is it correct to assume incrementals are probably around the 30% range, maybe a tick below that?  And then with growth led by some of the higher margin businesses plus 85 million of the next wave of cost take-outs, are those factored into that 30%?  It seems that there could eventually be upside to that if growth is in the very low single-digit range led by some more profitable businesses.","Frank Hermance","Yeah, it\u2019s a great question.  I think it\u2019s fair to assume a 35% contribution margin for next year\u2014or for this year, excuse me, 2013.  But when we talk about contribution margins, we exclude the effect of acquisitions because obviously you\u2019re not going to get that level of contribution margin on the deals themselves.  So I think using a 35% contribution model, extracting acquisitions in your model is a reasonable projection.  We actually did much better than that in 2012 because of the cost take-outs.","And yes, your point regarding the cost take-outs \u2013 you know, there\u2019s really an equation here that involves pricing and the cost take-outs in one hand, and on the other would be inflation and investments in the business.  So I\u2019ll just give you some rough numbers \u2013 these are just sort of averages if you took the middle of our guidance, that we\u2019re looking obviously for the 85 million in cost take-outs.  We\u2019re looking for pricing to be in the order of 1.5 to 2% of sales.  In terms of investments, we\u2019re going to\u2014well, what we\u2019ve got budgeted right now is about $35 million of investments, so then obviously the balance to that equation is inflation and of course the earnings that come from it.","So it\u2019s definitely possible that we could exceed the numbers that I\u2019m talking about, but we usually take a fairly conservative view as to our earnings and I think most of you are aware that we\u2019re very good at making our earnings estimates and hopefully exceeding them.  So we\u2019ll see what happens as the year transpires.","Matt McConnell \u2013 Citi","Okay, great.  Best of luck.  Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.  Please proceed with your question.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","","Hey, good morning everyone.  I just wanted to ask\u2014Frank, I\u2019m hoping that you\u2019ll do your typical un-bundling of each of the business units as part of this question; but I think even more specifically, I was wondering if you could tell us\u2014you know, I know that international continues to be a big thrust for you guys, but has that maybe changed form a little bit here to the extent that maybe we\u2019re de-emphasizing Europe a little bit and maybe re-emphasizing the BRIC sales?  At 50%, a little over 50%, are you looking to bring that number up into the 60s, or are you kind of happy with the 50 to 60% range?  I was just wondering what the intermediate term view was on that strategically.","Frank Hermance","Okay Scott.  Let me take the international growth question first, and then\u2014I\u2019ve already given you a breakdown of EMG.  I\u2019ll give you a breakdown of EIG so you have a better sense of what\u2019s going on there.  But if we looked at the international growth, you\u2019re absolutely right that our focus is in BRIC.  It\u2019s not as much in western Europe or in the U.S.  We see the growth coming out of the BRIC areas.  Just to give you some numbers, in the fourth quarter BRIC orders were up 24%, and they were actually up organically 16%.  So that bodes well, as I mentioned in response to Allison\u2019s question, that things are improving and that\u2019s where a large part of the growth is going to come from.  Doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not going to continue to put investments in the U.S. and continue to put investments in Europe in those areas that we think are good areas to invest, but clearly the focus is going to be in BRIC.  Rolled up in our budgets for this year, we\u2019re planning to add about 70 people, predominantly in sales and some in engineering and India into those areas to maximize our potential.   ","With regard to your specific around the percent of sales, we are inching that up.  It was at 52% in the fourth quarter.  It was 51% for the entire year of 2012; and yes, we would like to inch that up.  If you look at our market opportunities, having 55 to even as high as 60% of our sales in international areas makes sense.  It\u2019s difficult, though, to grow that international\u2014the BRIC content, I should say, the BRIC content because there aren\u2019t a lot of acquisition opportunities there.  So while it\u2019s doing very good organically, it\u2019s not as good from an acquisition viewpoint, so we tend to do the acquisitions more in baseline Europe and in the U.S., and therefore there\u2019s an offsetting sort of dynamic that happens there.  But in general, yes, we\u2019d like to increase that.","And then the first point you made, let me walk you through EIG since I already did EMG, and then you\u2019ll have the full picture.  In aerospace, our aerospace business had a strong year with really broad-based strength across all of its businesses.  We won sizeable new content on a number of new commercial and business and regional jet platforms, and continue to expand our third party MRO capabilities on a global basis.  In the fourth quarter, EIG aerospace sales were up mid-single digits.  We saw continued strength in commercial aerospace and business and regional jets.  Looking to 2013, we expect solid growth for our EIG aerospace business as our internal growth initiatives combined with trends in OEM build rates support really good commercial sales; and our business and regional jet business is also expecting to do very well, really driven more by key program wins on new aircraft than it is by a change in the marketplace.  So included in our budget and outlook for 2013, we\u2019re expecting EIG aerospace to be up mid to high single digits in 2013.  ","Taking a look at the process businesses, our process businesses had a strong year in 2012.  We completed a number of key acquisitions during the year \u2013 O\u2019Brien, Micro-Poise, and the recent technology acquisitions of Sunpower and Crystal.  These acquisitions, coupled with the continued investment in R&D and global expansion initiatives position us pretty good for 2013.","In the quarter, overall sales for process were up high teens on a percentage basis with flat organic growth.  Overall growth was driven by strength in our oil and gas and ultra-precision technology businesses combined with the contributions from the O\u2019Brien and Micro-Poise acquisitions.  What we\u2019re expecting in 2013 for our process businesses is to have them grow approximately 10% overall with organic growth probably conservatively estimated at low to mid single digits.  We really expect the oil and gas business to continue to do well.","And the last part of EIG is power and industrial.  That business also did well in all of 2012.  It was driven by strength predominantly in the power side of the business, and in the fourth quarter organic sales were actually down mid-single digits but that was against a very difficult comparison.  For 2013, we\u2019re expecting sales for power and industrial to be up low to mid-single digits.","So if you sum all of EIG, we\u2019re expecting sales to be up high single digits with organic growth of low to mid; and actually for EMG, we\u2019re expecting very similar results with overall growth of high single digits and organic growth of low to mid-single digits.  So that gives you a perspective across the company.","Did I get all your questions, Scott?","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","","Yeah, you did.  That was terrific.  Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.  Please proceed with your question.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","","Hi, good morning gentlemen.  Okay, so\u2014well, housekeeping.  Payables?","Robert Mandos","$321 million.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","321 million \u2013 okay, thank you.  Frank, as you were going through aerospace, was that just EIG aero that you were talking about; and if so, what happened with overall aerospace in the quarter and what are your expectations for overall aero in 2013?  And is the defense side, the military side getting affected by sequestration, anything like that?","Frank Hermance","Yeah, what I was referring to, since I was responding to the EIG part of the business, was essentially EIG.  If you look at the full aerospace businesses, what we\u2019re expecting in 2013 is to be up mid to high single digits.  We expect it to be quite strong, and if you break it down by the various sub-segments, we\u2019re expecting the commercial business to be up low double digits, we\u2019re expecting the third party MRO business to be up low double digits, we\u2019re expecting business and regional jets to be up mid single digits, and for military we are assuming in the overall mid to high single digit guidance a negative 5% for military.  ","Yes, we are seeing some impacts from sequestration, but actually our order intake and where we stand right now is pretty strong.  It would surely beat that organic down 5%, but it\u2019s pretty difficult to come up with an assumption as to what really is going to happen as Congress goes through its deliberations.  So we took a conservative view of the military business, so if the military business actually does better than that, then we could be approaching the double digit arena for all of aerospace.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay.  And then has the breakdown in aerospace shifted over the last year or two with some of the strength out of the other businesses versus, say, military\u2014","Frank Hermance","Well, it\u2019s a great question and you would think the answer would be yes, but the answer is actually there hasn\u2019t been a dramatic change and that\u2019s because the military business has continued to perform well.  So the mix has remained pretty much the same, and if you look at the mix, about a third of our business is military in aerospace and the other two-thirds is commercial and business and regional jets, and third party MRO.  So it\u2019s changed a little bit, but not substantially.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay.  And then final question on the power side, it sounds like industrial\u2014well, the industrial side of power, which I think you have some exposure to oil and gas there as well, but also you have a military exposure to power.  How is power looking if you maybe break it up that way in 2013?","Frank Hermance","Yeah, we don\u2019t have a sizeable amount of our power business that is related to military.  There is a little bit of that, but that was not a prime driver to the performance.  Most of the power business is much more commercially oriented.  We do have some military content but it is not a significant part of power overall.  ","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.  Please proceed with your question.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yes, good morning.  Frank, could you just talk for a minute or two about the Dreamliner production disruption and how you\u2019re thinking about that for the first quarter and into next year?  I would think that would have a measurable impact on your growth rate there in aero.","Frank Hermance","No, it\u2019s another great question, Richard.  Actually when you look at our content on aircraft, we have a very varied content.  We fly on just about every commercial plane there is, so this disruption that is occurring with the Boeing problems really is not going to have a major impact on our instrumentation business.  It could have a little impact but it\u2019s not significant in the grand scheme of things.  The key for us on actually all of these new platforms is that you need to be on them, because eventually the new platforms are going to be the business.  So we\u2019ve put a lot of effort on getting on the 787, the 350, the 380, the Max, the Neo \u2013 all of those airplanes.  But again, no one of them is significant.","There\u2019s another part of our business, which is the EMIP over in EMG, that makes master alloys for titanium, and there has been some disruption in that business but it\u2019s not really driven by this recent problem on the 787.  There was actually some build-up in the supply chain, so that business has been a little bit softer the last three months and will be a bit soft in the first quarter, but that\u2019s included within the estimates that we have given you.","So I think that\u2019s the best way I can characterize the 787.  Now obviously if the 787 is off the market for an extended period of time, as I think about I still don\u2019t think there be a huge impact because what will happen is it will shift to other aircraft and we\u2019ll just put product on different aircraft.  But hopefully Boeing will get their arms around this and get it fixed.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay.  And then just a question on the geography \u2013 can you just rough out the size of China itself for \u201912 and maybe what the expectation is there for growth in \u201913?","Frank Hermance","Yeah, if you look at all of our Far East business, on a rough order it\u2019s about 19% of our sales.  The China piece is about half of that in rough numbers \u2013 these guys are looking up the exact numbers, but I know that\u2019s kind of in the ballpark.  The growth rate that we\u2019re assuming in our budget and in our roll-up is really like a mid-single digit number.  It\u2019s not real aggressive, and actually when we put our numbers together, we didn\u2019t have privy to how strong the orders were in the fourth quarter and therefore we took a more conservative view.  So I as I said in my response to one of the questions, if that really comes back and you start to see the normal kind of growth over there, which would be more in the high single digit arena, we\u2019ll do better than the estimates that I provided to you.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay.  And then again, if we look at \u201913 and maybe the core growth assumption for \u201913, if we\u2019ve got maybe a mid-single digit for Asia, can you just fill in the blanks there?  Is Europe expected to be up, flat, and then where does that leave the U.S. for \u201913?","Frank Hermance","Yeah, actually what we\u2019re assuming is similar growth in Europe and in the U.S., and the reason for that, which might be surprising, is what I mentioned before \u2013 we happen to have some businesses in Europe that will outperform the macroeconomic trends because we in essence have aerospace businesses there, both OEM and third party MRO, that are performing reasonably, and we also roll-up the oil and gas businesses from the Middle East there.  So we\u2019re expecting sort of low single digits from Europe, low single digits from the U.S., mid-single digits from Asia, and that\u2019s sort of where this low to mid level comes from.","I think we\u2019ve got the opportunity to outperform that, but we\u2019re taking sort of a cautious view with all of the uncertainty that\u2019s going on in the world right now.","Richard Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Sure, okay.  Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.  Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks, good morning.  So an interesting kind of mismatch between the organic growth in the quarter and the orders resilience.  I guess what it points to is a dynamic of project deferrals.  I\u2019m wondering what signs you\u2019re seeing of that resolving.  Doesn\u2019t seem like you factor much into the first quarter on that dynamic kind of shifting.","Frank Hermance","Yeah, you\u2019re right on.  The fourth quarter was interesting because we did see these push-outs occur, and the orders were extremely strong. But we\u2019ve been cautious on the first quarter.  We want to see it play out.  You would hope with the orders as strong as they were that we\u2019ll see some better growth in Q1, but I want to run the business assuming that\u2019s not going to happen and make darn sure we get the earnings, and then if we get a little bit better growth and some of those push-outs in effect land in Q1, and there isn\u2019t more push-outs into Q2, we\u2019ll obviously over-perform.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay.  And in that dynamic of orders, goods, sales a little soft, can you break the U.S. out in that sense?","Frank Hermance","Actually when you look at the fourth quarter, by region of the world in sales, they\u2019re all about the same.  They\u2019re all about the same.  They\u2019re all in this minus-1%, minus-2% kind of region, and it\u2019s because of all the dynamics I\u2019ve talked about where there were push-outs but aerospace tends to over-perform the market, and we didn\u2019t see the sales growth yet in Asia.  What we saw was the order growth, so that\u2019s the dynamic.  Very interesting.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","I guess the question was so the U.S. did participate in that dynamic where order growth outperformed sales growth as well?","Frank Hermance","Yes, yes.  ","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay.","Frank Hermance","Yes, I\u2019m sorry.  I didn\u2019t answer the question in the right way.  Yes, if you\u2019re asking by region where did we get the outperformance, yes, we definitely got outperformance in the U.S.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay.  And then lastly on the operating margin, very strong in the quarter.  What was the contribution of temporary belt-tightening?","Frank Hermance","I don\u2019t think we have that rolled up, so I really can\u2019t answer that specifically.  But there definitely was belt-tightening because as we went in the quarter and we saw some of these project deferrals that you were referring to, we definitely tightened our belts.  And as I mentioned, the actual cost savings overall that went through the P&L for the full year was actually higher than what we told you in the third quarter estimates, which means we actually did more than we had anticipated.  Some of that is temporal, but also some of it is permanent, and that will help us as we go into 2013.  But we\u2019ve got significant confidence that this additional $85 million that I\u2019m talking about that will roll through the P&L in 2013 will happen.  I think you know we\u2019re very good at this, we\u2019ve got very detailed plans by division, by business unit, by product line in essence as to what we\u2019re going to do and how we\u2019re going to achieve that $85 million.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","I have noticed that.  Thanks, Frank.","Operator","Thank you.  [Operator instructions]  Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets.  Please proceed with your question.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good morning.  First question is a follow-on there on the margin \u2013 EIG at obviously record levels.  It sounds like that may be sustainable.  Just wanted to confirm that in your view.","Frank Hermance","Yeah, I do believe the EIG margins are high, obviously, but they\u2019re at sustainable kinds of levels.  As I\u2019ve mentioned before, we think there is opportunity on the EMG side of the business because obviously the absolute level of those margins are lower, and that\u2019s obviously part of our 2013 plan.  If I were going to give you some guidance for 2013 when you roll all of the things up \u2013 the costs, the incremental effect from low to mid-single digit organic growth, inflation, investments, et cetera \u2013 what we have running through this is about 30 to 50 basis points of margin improvement.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Great, that\u2019s helpful.  And then just a follow-on on the oil and gas business where you\u2019re expecting to see some positive trends in \u201913.  Can you talk a little bit more about maybe some of the applications and geographies where you\u2019re expecting to see some of that strength?","Frank Hermance","Yeah, it\u2019s clearly going to be driven from the international front versus the U.S. front.  A good indicator of how well the oil and gas businesses will do is rig counts, and if you look at the worldwide rig counts, they\u2019re essentially at record highs.  There\u2019s about 3,500 active rigs on a worldwide basis, but if you look at the growth that has occurred and is expected to occur, the U.S. rig count is actually going down while the international rig count is going up.  So there\u2019s a dynamic below the top line of what\u2019s happening, and that plays well to us because about 70% of our business is outside the U.S. in this particular business.  We\u2019ve particularly focused internationally because there\u2019s a lot of expansion going on in that area. ","There\u2019s also this dynamic of fracking, which is a hot political topic in the U.S., and at some point I think we\u2019ll bust through that because we\u2019ve got enough both oil and gas below us right here in the U.S. to really become energy independent, and we really need to capitalize on that.  But the rig count is going down in the U.S. right now.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks, and if I could just sneak one more quick one in?","Frank Hermance","","Sure.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","On the cost-driven motors business, comps are starting to turn flat, potentially turning positive.  Just want to get your perspective there on does that make you potentially more positive on early cycle recovery, or do you see that as less of kind of a canary in the coal mine indicator business at this point?","Frank Hermance","Yeah, we do have\u2014I have more confidence this year than I have over the past several years in our floor care business.  It\u2019s not because of a fundamental change in the market dynamics.  It\u2019s really driven by the fact that we have won some business, major business with one large customer.  I can\u2019t speak to who that is, but it\u2019s a substantial amount of business that you may recall I mentioned that our orders were strong in the fourth quarter, and that also was driven by this major customer.  So I think we\u2019re going to see better results out of that business over the course of actually the next few years, based on the relationship that we have developed with this customer.","And also, these are high-end motors which means that the profit margins are higher than the base business; so you detected a signal from me, but it\u2019s not because of the market.  ","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay.  Thanks very much.  Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.  Please proceed with your question.","Joe Radigan \u2013 KeyBanc","Hi, good morning, Frank.  This is actually Joe Radigan on for Matt.  I just had a quick follow-on on the order rates.  Just in terms of the sequential cadence during the quarter, I believe you said you saw a ramp up that peaked in December.  Can you comment on what you\u2019ve seen so far in January?  Have you seen a continuation of that progress in order rates into 2013?","Frank Hermance","You know, I don\u2019t have\u2014on a sequential basis, I actually don\u2019t have that information.  What I can tell you is we are on target for our January orders.  We get those on a daily basis.  Do you guys know?  I don\u2019t have that.","Robert Mandos","We\u2019d have to look that up sequentially.","Frank Hermance","Okay.  So we\u2019ll have to get that for you.  I just don\u2019t have it at my fingertips.  But I think the key point is we\u2019re surely in line with the guidance I\u2019ve given you for the first, say, three weeks or whatever of January.","Joe Radigan \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay, perfect.  Thanks.  That\u2019s all I had.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is a follow-up question coming from the line of Matt McConnell with Citi Research.  Please proceed with your question.","Matt McConnell \u2013 Citi","Great, thank you.  I wonder if I could slip in a quick follow-up on Dunkermotoren.  I know it\u2019s been probably two or three quarters since that closed.  Could you give an update on how that integration\u2019s been going and maybe profitability, and I think it was a one point drag to the EMG margin.  Was that roughly in line with your expectation?  ","Frank Hermance","Yeah, it\u2019s now performing very good.  I\u2019m very, very pleased with the operating team there.  We just did a review recently and that team has embraced the Ametek culture, and they\u2019re very good and their profit margins are lower \u2013 there\u2019s no question.  We knew that when we acquired them.  As we do with most acquisitions, we\u2019re going to continue to work and improve those margins, and your analysis is right \u2013 it was about 100 basis points improvement.","And actually just to expand on your question, this is not going to be an atypical situation as we go forward because obviously if you look at our margins with respect to peer companies, our margins are very high; so there is going to be an impact on the margins when you bring in deals.  And our preference is actually to bring in deals that have lower margins because part of the value we can create is to increase those margins.  So I would say Dunker is a typical example of that, so we view that from a return on invested capital viewpoint because we buy these businesses at, say, 10% pre-tax profits, and over the course of a relatively short period of time, we can make many of these businesses 20%-plus pre-tax.  That just means the return on invested capital is off the charts.  ","Matt McConnell \u2013 Citi","Okay, great.  Helpful.  Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is a follow-up question coming from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.  Please proceed with your question.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Just real quickly, Frank \u2013 you talked about 85 million in gross savings in 2013.  ","Frank Hermance","Yes.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","And you had 85 million in \u201912, correct?","Frank Hermance","That\u2019s correct.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Now if I remember, you guided 60 million at the very beginning of 2012, so you outperformed\u2014","Frank Hermance","That\u2019s correct.","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","So how much of that was\u2014I mean, certainly some of that is probably due to acquisitions you made over the year and then you got some additional savings there, but how much can you say was organic, if I can put it in that way?  Does that make sense?","Frank Hermance","Yeah, it does.  Great question.  I can give you a gut feel.  I can\u2019t give you exact numbers.  But my gut feel is that probably 70% of that was organic, and what happened in 2012 \u2013 and your numbers are correct \u2013 when we started the year, we assumed 60 million; but then as we were going through the year with the macroeconomic uncertainty, and we saw that we weren\u2019t going to get as much top line, as was true for most industrial companies, we focused on increasing that number from the $60 million kind of region up to what ended up to be 85 million.","So I think there\u2019s some room as we go through this year.  It would not surprise me if as we get into the year, our businesses do better than the 85 million.  There probably is not as much leverage as we got in 2012; in other words, going from 60 to 85.  I doubt we\u2019ll go from 85 to 85 plus 25, but I think the number could be higher.","Does that help?","Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research","Very much so.  Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Mr. Coleman, there are no further questions at this time.  I will now turn the call back to you.","Kevin Coleman","Okay, great.  Thanks everyone for joining our conference call.

AMETEK began 2019 with an outstanding first quarter, establishing records for sales, orders, backlog, EBITDA and operating income. Our businesses delivered strong overall sales growth, with solid organic growth and meaningful contribution from the six acquisitions we completed in 2018.","Our business has also deliver fantastic operating performance, with impressive operating income growth in core margin expansion leading to 15% adjusted earnings growth which nicely exceeded our expectations. We also generated strong cash flow, with operating cash flow increasing 11% year-over-year. Given these strong results, we have increased our earnings guidance for 2019.","Now onto the financial highlights for the quarter. Total sales in the first quarter were $1.29 billion, up 10% compared to the first quarter of 2018. Organic sales growth was again strong at 5%, with acquisitions adding 7% and foreign currency at 2-point headwind. We also generated a record level of orders in the first quarter, with another quarter of positive book-to-bill. Our record backlog of $1.7 billion provides a solid visibility as we move through 2019.","EBITDA in the first quarter was a record $337 million, up 10% over the same period in 2018 and EBITDA margins were excellent at 26.2%. Operating income in the quarter was a record at $283.3 million, up 10% over the prior year period, with the reported operating margins of 22%.","Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins increased an impressive 70 basis points over 2018 first quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1 per share, up 15% over the comparable basis for 2018, exceeding our guidance range of $0.95 per diluted share to $0.97 per diluted share.","Now turning to the first quarter results of the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group, EIG sales in the quarter increased 13% to $806.9 million. Recent acquisitions contributed 10% and organic sales growth was up 4%. Foreign currency was a 2-point headwind.","Our Materials Analysis businesses continued to deliver strong growth as their high end analytical instrumentation solutions are very well-positioned in attractive growth markets. EIG\u2019s operating performance in the quarter was outstanding, with operating income of $203.1 million, up 11% over 2018\u2019s first quarter. Reported operating income margins were 25.2%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points over the prior year\u2019s first quarter.","The Electromechanical Group also had a great quarter, with strong organic sales growth and excellent operating performance. EMG\u2019s first quarter sales increased 5% to a record $480.8 million with organic sales growth a very strong 7%. The acquisition of FMH added 1% and foreign currency was a 2-point headwind.","We continue to see broad based growth across our Automation, Engineered Materials and Aerospace and Defense businesses, each the continuing to deliver solid growth. EMG also delivered excellent operating performance in the quarter, with operating income increasing 9% to $98.8 million. Operating margins expanded nicely up 70 basis points to 20.6%.","I am very pleased with the AMETEK\u2019s first quarter performance, which has positioned us very well for another year of record results. The AMETEK growth model which combines our four growth strategies, with a disciplined focus on cash generation, capital deployment and talent development continues to provide the framework for driving long-term and sustainable value for our shareholders.","Before, I discuss our updated outlook for 2019, I wanted to highlight some of the recent achievements of our colleagues have had in driving success for AMETEK. I will start with the collaborative R&D effort between two of our businesses, which resulted in the release of two innovative new products.","In March, EDAX, a leading provider of materials characterization systems unveiled is Velocity Plus and Velocity Super models. The Velocity Super at 4,500 frames per second is the fastest electron batch diffraction camera system in the world. Both new velocity systems are powered by high-speed, low noise, CMOS sensors developed by our Vision Research business, a leading provider of ultra high-speed cameras. These new additions to the EDAX portfolio offers our customers a superior solution to help solve materials characterization and elemental composition challenges in both R&D and broader industrial settings.","Congratulations to the EDAX and Vision Research teams for coming together and developing these world-class new products. This is just one example of the many market leading new products and solutions our businesses are developing to help solve our customers\u2019 most complex challenges.","Our businesses are also capturing additional market share by expanding into attractively positioned adjacent markets. Rauland, a leading provider of communication systems for use in hospitals and healthcare facilities has a renewed focus on expanding its technology offering to serve schools and educational institutions.","Through its Telecenter U, Rauland provides school districts and campuses with flexible, streamlined communication capabilities for its students and staff. Utilizing a suite of proprietary hardware and software applications, Telecenter U synchronizes mass communications across multiple locations for everyday messages, event scheduling and in critical emergency situations.","The solution can play a key role in helping to improve the safety and security of students and teachers during crisis situations, and it is designed to help automate and manage our schools crisis plan during the crucial first few minutes before first responders arrive.","Rauland has done an excellent job expanding its technology focus on safety within our schools. We will continue to invest our new product development and market expansion initiatives as we are seeing outstanding results from these investments. Our teams are also doing incredible job integrating our recent acquisitions into AMETEK.","In 2018, we deployed over $1.1 billion of capital on fixed acquisitions and acquired approximately $350 million in annual sales. These acquisitions are already showing strong performance, and we expect them to generate excellent results in 2019. We remain focused on deploying our strong free cash flow on strategic acquisitions. While we are aggressively pursuing these opportunities, we will remain disciplined on our acquisition efforts.","Our teams are actively pursuing a broad pipeline of opportunities, and we are confident that we will be able to continue to complete value enhancing acquisitions. Finally, we continue to focus on driving operational excellence, the corner store of the AMETEK growth model. In the first quarter, we generated strong savings from our operational excellence initiatives, largely resulting from our global sourcing and strategic determined activities.","For all of 2019, we expect to generate over $80 million in operational excellence savings. We remain focused on developing and enhancing continuous improvement processes to drive positive operating results in 2019 and beyond.","Now moving to our updated outlook. Given our performance in the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect 2019 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.98 to $4.08 per diluted share, an increase of 9% to 11% over the comparable basis in 2018. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share.","We continue to expect overall sales in 2019 to be up high single digits with organic sales up 3% to 5%. In the second quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up high single digits and adjusted earnings to be in the range of $1 to $1.02 per diluted share, a 9% to 11% increase over the prior year period.","To summarize, our businesses outperformance in the first quarter firmly positions AMETEK for another year of strong growth. Our experienced management teams, our market-leading niche businesses and the proven growth model allows AMETEK to deliver strong and consistent performance.","I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter and then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?","Bill Burke","Thank you, Dave.","As Dave just mentioned, AMETEK began the year with excellent performance delivering record results that exceeded our expectations. I will now provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.","Core selling expenses in the quarter was up in line with the core sales growth. First quarter general and administrative expenses were up $2.4 million over the same period in 2018 due largely to higher compensation costs. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 1.4%, in line with last year\u2019s level. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.5%, down from last year\u2019s first quarter rate of 23.1%.","In 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.5%. And as we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Working capital on the quarter was 18.2%, up versus the prior year due to large parts of the impact from the acquisitions in 2018.","Capital expenditures were $21 million for the first quarter. And for 2019, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, or 1.9% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $58 million. And for the full year, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $235 million, including acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $130 million, or $0.43 per diluted share.","Operating cash flow in the quarter was $196 million, up 11% over last year\u2019s first quarter and free cash flow was $175 million. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.47 billion, down $160 million from $2.63 billion at the end of 2018.","Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $368 million, resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of March 31 of 1.6 times. We remain well positioned to support our growth initiatives with more than $1.8 billion of cash and existing credit facilities.","To conclude, our businesses started the year with outstanding performance delivering high quality results. Our outlook for 2019 remains positive given our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?","Kevin Coleman","Great, thank you, Bill. Sydney, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Kevin Coleman","Good morning, Matt. How are you there?","Dave Zapico","Sydney, why don\u2019t we move on to the next call?","Matt Summerville","Hello","Kevin Coleman","Matt are you there?","Matt Summerville","Yes. Can you hear me?","Kevin Coleman","Yes, now, yes.","Matt Summerville","Yes. I am sorry. I don\u2019t know what have them there. Anyways, Could you maybe comment as to the linearity you saw in your business throughout the quarter, anything unusual across the three regions? And then maybe give a little regional color around the 5% organic growth sort of what was better, what was worse?","David Zapico","Right. I will start with the geographic update. And there was a dynamic in one of our regions that was a little bit different, so I will talk about that also. In the U.S., there was a strong high single-digit growth. It was a broad-based growth, particularly in our Aerospace business, our Process businesses and our EMIP business.","It really fired on all cylinders. Europe was a pleasant surprise, up mid-single digits, a solid growth in automation and Process businesses drove that growth. And Asia was roughly flat. And also there was a dynamic where the activities seemed to slow in February, but it picked up very strongly in March.","So some of our folks were speculating that some of the uncertainty or the Chinese New Year may have slowed our business activity. But again in March, we ended up with a record order input for Asia. So it was flat, but going forward, we haven\u2019t changed any of our outlook for the region. So across-the-board, it was pretty good quarter.","Matt Summerville","And then just lastly, Dave, can you maybe comment on where you were in Q1 with price realization and how that compared to inflation?","David Zapico","Yes. Matt, I didn\u2019t answer your linearity question. I mean, we strengthened through the quarter and our strongest month was March, which is not atypical for us. And related to the price inflation, Q1 \u201819 was much like the second half of 2018. We had an excellent quarter. We achieved about 2 percentage points of price across our entire business. Total inflation was a bit less than 1.5%.","So we are very pleased with these results, and we think we are well positioned to continue this for the balance of 2019. That speaks to the, as I said before, the highly differentiated nature of our product portfolio on our leadership positions in these niche markets. And also our focus and determination to stay ahead of the inflation in a changing global economic environment.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Andrew Obin","Yes, Just maybe a basic question, but just looking at the seasonality, given what the first quarter was, usually first quarter for you is quite a bit couple of percentage points less than 25%. And I guess, second quarter guide and the annual guide implies that on a seasonal basis, second half is going to be weaker than usual, just looking back 10 years. And I was just wondering if you are seeing any yellow flags that are driving this kind of caution, or you are just being conservative?","Bill Burke","Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Andrew. I mean, the first point is, in quarter 2, our guide is higher than quarter 1. So we typically -- from Q1 to Q2, it\u2019s a bit higher. And we grew sales organically at the high-end of our guidance range. And in the first quarter, we had excellent core margin performance. And we raised our guidance letting the entire Q1 earnings to be flowed through to the new guide.","But to your final point, it\u2019s still early in the year. And we feel good about how the quarter played out, but we are being a bit prudent. And the uncertainty of the economic environment and we feel that we are very comfortable with our guidance.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up question. I guess since 2014, we have been sort of waiting for big come back for your Energy business. And if you can just comment what WTI being north of 60, are you seeing any change in tone from your customers to that point that maybe it would finally really take off where it\u2019s just going to be steady climb as it used to be?","Bill Burke","Sure. The Energy business is probably a bit smaller as a percentage of total AMETEK because of some of the organic growth we have had in other areas and our M&A. It\u2019s about 6% of the company and in the first quarter, it was up low single digits and for the full year, we are expecting it to be up mid-single digits.","And we are looking at our -- for the full year, we are looking at our upstream business to be high single digits and the mid-downstream to be up mid-single digits. And we have about 75% of our business in the mid and downstream. And what we are starting to see is typical recovery, that part of the business, our largest part of businesses starting to gain momentum.","So we feel very good about our energy business. We feel really good about the market positions we have and the businesses continuing to grow. We had a great year last year and it looks like it\u2019s on target for another good year this year.","Andrew Obin","But any near-term change in behavior as the oil price rallied in the past 3 months?","Bill Burke","We have solid backlogs, but I can\u2019t say that there was a change -- a notable change in behavior when the price of oil raised the last few months and there wasn\u2019t a change of behavior when it dropped precipitously in Q4. We just had a steady increasing level of business and it\u2019s a global business about 2\/3 of outside the U.S. and it just feels really solid. And as I said, the mid and downstream business is picking up nicely.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Bhupender Bohra","This is Bhupender here sitting in for Nigel. So Dave, you mentioned about the core orders in the quarter, can you give us some color on the core orders numbers for the whole company as well as EIG and EMG? And just wanted to talk about some of the end markets, which kind of strengthened or weakened during the quarter or you actually see from a color especially in April what we are seeing here?","David Zapico","Sure, Bhupender. The first thing would be the organic orders. They were up 3.5% for the quarter. That\u2019s actually -- remember against a very difficult comp at -- we were up plus 12% in Q1 of 2018. So really solid orders performance, we had excellent book-to-bill. Our book-to-bill was 1.07. I think this mark 10 straight quarters with a positive book-to-bill. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $1.7 billion.","So we are feeling really good about environment we are operating in and from what we are hearing from our businesses, and we continue to see a solid underlying demand. We are really well positioned to perform well in this environment. And regarding April, I haven\u2019t seen the data as of today, but I have seen it as of yesterday, and we are right on track. So no change in pace in April, and we are feeling good about Q2.","Bhupender Bohra","And just a question on your guidance for the second quarter. The sales are going to grow up high single, do you have the organic growth number? Like what of kind of organic is built in those numbers?","David Zapico","The organic growth would be the same level at the 3%, 4%, 5% that we have guided for the year for AMETEK.","Bhupender Bohra","So it\u2019s within the range, okay, got it. And lastly, on the -- you talked a little bit about the M&A pipeline, you guys did a great job like deploying up, Bill, more than $1 billion here over the last -- in 2018. Any color on the size, at least the pipeline, EIG, EMGs, how it\u2019s kind of mix wise as well as maybe just give us around the hone kind of color on M&A.","Bill Burke","Yes, sure on M&A. Our M&A pipeline is very active. As always, we are evaluating a number of opportunities. And we have a very broad pipeline, it needs to be broad. Because we are in the environment with the oil pricing up and with the competitiveness of the environment, we have to select the deals from our broad pipeline, which will give us a solid return on capital.","So the M&A environment is similar to what we have been experiencing in the past few years, and we are looking at deals across both of our groups. And I am very encouraged with the progress on the pipeline. And you can\u2019t predict in the next quarter if the deal is going to close, but I feel very confident on the long term with our process capability in M&A and with our tremendous pipeline. So I am very bullish about M&A.","Bhupender Bohra","And lastly, it\u2019s on the Aerospace, I just want to leave at this. Any -- if you can explain the exposure on the 737 Max here, anything on that front? And any pressure from the down tick on the production especially from the Boeing?","David Zapico","Right, as you know, AMETEK is not dependent on any one platform. So we are on lot of or on just about every platform, but we are not overly dependent on anyone. So when you look at the 737 issue, first of all, Boeing hasn\u2019t reduced the orders forecast and production plan that we are seeing here.","So we are still going along meeting that demand. The second point would be for the full year of 2019, the 737 Max accounts for about $15 million in revenue. So that puts it in an order of magnitude. It\u2019s a small part of the company, I think, probably about 0.25% of revenue.","So we are not overly dependent on it. We certainly want to see the problem fixed and want to keep producing at the rate we are producing on. But we had in the quarter strong OEM business. The commercial business was very solid. Our Aerospace business was up high single digits in the first quarter, and we are forecasting it to be up mid-single digit for the year.","So strong growth in all segments and maybe there\u2019s a bit of conservatism there, but we feel really good about our Aerospace business in all of our market segments.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Brett Linzey","Just wanted to come back to margins. Obviously, a lot of noise with FX and deal impacts moving through the reported margins, what were the core incremental margins that you saw in the quarter at the total company level and at the segment level?","Dave Zapico","Okay. At the AMETEK level it was 35% and at the EIG level it was 50% and at the EMG level it was 25%. So pretty typical performance, very strong performance and that we are very pleased.","Brett Linzey","Okay, good. And then just a follow-up on the order question. Appreciate the color on the 3.5%. What does that look like at the segment level, were both positive or was the complexion, one negative, one up. And then within that order number, should we assume that that includes roughly two points of price, similar to what you realized that the sales line in the quarter? Thanks.","Dave Zapico","Yes. You probably should assume that because our pricing is been pretty consistent.At the group line, EIG was up 5% organically in orders and EMG was up 1% organically in orders. And EMG had the toughest hurdle, because last year we had a very difficult comp at 12% and EMG was a bit stronger than EIG. So really all of our businesses have solid order performance and we have, as I said before, an excellent book-to-bill and record backlog. So we are feeling really good about the orders and it\u2019s really across the board.","Brett Linzey","And then maybe just one last one on pricing, very good pricing power all year really as you guys look out into the balance of the year and you have seen some of these commodities and raw material start to moderate here. Is there a period of give back and maybe you could just update us remind us how you are pricing mechanisms work, specifically within the metals business?","Dave Zapico","Yes, I\u2019d say in AMETEK, except for the metals business. There isn\u2019t a period of give back. I think within the metals business. We don\u2019t really count that is price. So that\u2019s just the commodity fluctuations that get passed on to the customer. And what you really have there is a lot of the metals have stabilized, but the price of vanadium is one metal that\u2019s important to us that\u2019s trough as strong recently. So that will have a modest impact as we go forward on EMG\u2019s specialty metals business, but I don\u2019t expect much of an impact at the AMETEK level.","Operator","And our following question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy","It\u2019s nice to have a boring AMETEK, right. And yeah, but I guess from that perspective in some of the excellent questioning that was ahead of May. I think it is a question about kind of the guide the cadence for the year. Could you talk about that in the context of you have entered a kind of slightly different range for the kind of deals you are looking at terms of growth and potentially valuation and even, and even underlying margins.","Do you think given what the properties you are looking at now just dictated by the market environment, the pricing environment. Do you think that some of the accretion is being blunted, so that we might see a little bit more next year or another way to saying it is of the deals you have announced so far. What would you expect for kind of accretion in 2020, given the fact that it sounds like do have a lot of puts and takes for 2019?","Dave Zapico","Yes, I think in 2018, we said that was about $0.12 of benefit. In 2019, there is about 12% of -- $0.12 of benefit from an M&A and we had a lot of deals, sluggish deals at the end of 2018. So those deals are working their way through the system and there are certainly a lot of integration activities going on.","So yes, from those deals the timing wise will be though I have a potentially bigger, bigger benefit in 2020. But we are still seeing good margins now with our core business, and that\u2019s very positive on those deals and the integrations are progressing very well. So they are spread out amongst our operating units and we feel good about them.","Robert McCarthy","And, and forgive me for another kind of impolitic question, but it\u2019s easier ask these questions, when your stock has rallied as significantly as it has in the investor perception has changed radically as it has over the last three years. But if you were so critical about yourself and the organization over the past three years to four years in terms of M&A, how do you miss on a transaction? Or how do you grade yourself on where you are pitfalls are with AMETEK strategic style in terms of going after assets?","Dave Zapico","I think our style was one that equates to returns. And we look for a cash-on-cash, after-tax, return on invested capital, 10% in year three on all these deals and we haven\u2019t changed that. And we are getting that kind of return on the deals were getting done and we are not chasing deals that we can get a return on.","So our per take maybe that we are not paying the inflated prices, but we feel very comfortable in the long run that there\u2019s a lot of discipline in our system, we want to maintain that discipline, and we look at the return on total capital on our balance sheet. The return on capital is about 13% in the first quarter.","Our cost of capital is more like 8.5% and we think the difference between the two as what we are creating a value for our long-term shareholders and we look at that very closely. So that\u2019s the key driver behind our acquisition strategy. We have a lot of discipline and we don\u2019t plan to change that.","Operator","And our following question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Deane Dray","Just like to go into some of the variables and puts and takes in the quarter, if I could. Some of the dynamics that the industrial companies have been contending with any puts and takes that you have seen regarding tariff? The second one is pull-in.","Some of the companies saw cases where they actually had bigger demand pulled out of the first quarter to the fourth quarter. Did you see any of that? And then anything about - you are not typically someone to complain about the weather, but was there any factor there too? Just start there too, please.","Dave Zapico","I guess I will start with the weather and it didn\u2019t have a measurable impact on our business. So what the tariff, Q1 2019, there was situation played out as we predicted. We had about $0.01 from the direct impact from tariffs and we offset that totally with price and our sourcing activities have been successful in reducing growth tariffs and we are active and continuing to those sourcing plan. So price actions completely offset tariffs and we feel good about that.","And your last question there regarding the pull-ins, we look very hard at the pull-ins and, there is always some things pulled into Q4 before the end of the year maybe to avoid a price increase. But it wasn\u2019t any different than any other prior year. So we are not saying we put a lot into Q4 2018. We really looked at it hard. And looked, about the same thought. So those are answered.","Deane Dray","That\u2019s all. Good. Yes, those are all good to hear. And just going back to the record backlog and just could you remind us how much of your backlog would convert in 2019? What percent of that and just talk about that visibility that gives you?","Dave Zapico","Yes, Deane. I think it\u2019s about 85%. It comes out in the next year. So it gives you some very good visibility. But quite frankly there were a number of our businesses that are our book and ship that in the month of the quarter. So we don\u2019t want to take it too far. But 85% of that $1.7 billion is going to go up this year.","Deane Dray","And then last question from me. Was there any growth investments in the quarter that you would call out? What just remind us what the growth investment budget is for 2019?","Dave Zapico","Right. I highlighted the product development and EDAX and also the product development in the adjacent expansion roll-on. Those were the highlights. And regarding investment for the year, we are investing about $80 million of incremental investments in sales, marketing and engineering activities.","As $80 million more than we invested in 2018. So, and that spend is relatively linear through the year and we are getting a good return on it. So certainly, we are investing heavily but our businesses are really focused on getting a return and we are very pleased with our new product development activities and also the work we are done in commercial excellence, and improving our capability to go to market.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is open.","Richard Eastman","Yes. Good morning.","Dave Zapico","Good morning.","Richard Eastman","Dave, just looking at the core growth rates in the quarter, the 3% for EIG and the 7% for EMG against really a tough comp. I am curious as the revenue shook out in the quarter, was there any movement between segments, was EMG maybe a bit of a positive surprise and maybe think -- anything in EIG that maybe became an order that didn\u2019t ship or is there -- was there any movement between the segments here relative to the first quarter macro?","Dave Zapico","Yeah. The -- one first point there, I will make a small correction that what you said. EIG organic growth was 4% in Q1, not 3%.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Fair enough. Same question then applies.","Dave Zapico","Same question applies and it really played out as we thought. I mean, we had a forecast that was -- and both sides of the business met their forecast. So it\u2019s pretty much a\u2026","Richard Eastman","Okay.","Dave Zapico","\u2026very, very -- from the sales execution side, it was a very predictable quarter for us.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And the one thing that steps out from a margin perspective, your core margin in EIG of, I think, you said it was up 110 basis points on the core side.","Dave Zapico","Right.","Richard Eastman","Was that primarily, I mean, what are the dynamics there, was it -- is it mix, was there more price there in EIG product lines or mix or just seems like a very positive variance.","Dave Zapico","Yeah. You are right, Rick. It is a positive variance and you have the cost reduction factored in also. But our pricing that we got 2% in the quarter was broad based across our portfolio, but it\u2019s a little bit higher in EIG than EMG and we definitely had a positive mix. I mean, at this stage of the cycle, people are buying our fully option products. They have money to spend and our mix is positive. So those are the two -- really three factors. We managed cost well, we have got good price in EIG and the mix was positive.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just last question around the M&A and the deals that they are kind of in your pipeline or potential deals in the pipeline, a couple of things. One, are they skewed the prospects, are they skewed towards either EIG or EMG and is there a theme in your pipeline around the type of businesses or the products? Maybe you could just address that perhaps?","Dave Zapico","Yes. EIG is about two-thirds of our business and EMG is about a third. So I think the pipeline reflects that skewing. We are looking on a lot of our business is broad based. Looking at the differentiated products, the secular versus cyclical markets would be a\u2026","Richard Eastman","Yeah.","Dave Zapico","\u2026 priority, so it\u2019s a lot of what you have seen recently. There is healthcare, there is more process, instrumentation, there\u2019s an automation business, there is some very good properties we are looking at, the Power and Industrial segment. So the Aerospace business, I mean, across the Board, we are looking and...","Richard Eastman","Okay. Yeah. Is there a healthy element of this kind of connectivity theme or any type of software extensions to the hardware? Is that representative in there as well?","Dave Zapico","A little bit.","Richard Eastman","Yeah.","Dave Zapico","You see a little bit, it\u2019s around in a little bit with telearm and things like that, that\u2019s certainly\u2026","Richard Eastman","Yeah.","Dave Zapico","\u2026a theme we are looking at. But it\u2019s not -- doesn\u2019t define our entire pipeline for sure.","Richard Eastman","Yeah. Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Dave Zapico","Thank you, Richard.","Operator","Thank you. And our following question comes from Joe Giordano. Your line is open.","Joe Giordano","Good morning, guys.","Dave Zapico","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Giordano","Hey. So, if you have a guess, if you spend the same amount in 2019 on M&A, you did in 2018. Is it more likely that in six deals, more than six deal, less than six deals, like how you skewing the size that\u2019s in your pipeline right now?","Dave Zapico","I don\u2019t want to guess, Joe. Because the pipeline has some more sizable deals and it also has some smaller deals and with our disciplined approach, you don\u2019t know what you are going to find. So we could spend the same as we spent last year. We could spend a lot more. We can spend less and the deals could be a lot of different sizes. So I don\u2019t want -- that\u2019s pretty hard to predict at this point of the year.","Joe Giordano","Fair enough. Dave, one of the things you have focused on when you came on to CEO role was kind of spending to reinvigorate organic growth and on the front end of the business. And certainly that\u2019s shown through on results but part of that is also in your underlying market is getting better. So how would kind of break that down between success internally at AMETEK relative to just your markets getting better over the last couple of years here?","Dave Zapico","Yeah. That\u2019s -- we just finished our ninth quarter in a row with our average organic growth of 6%. So we are really pleased with that. But, clearly, the economic environment helped us, but certainly the focus and work that we are doing is improved also. Our customer facing capability is really improved and our teams are excited and we are seeing positive results from growth Kaizens and digital marketing, and our sales force is much more effective. We are driving aftermarket growth and it\u2019s becoming part of our culture and important part of our business system. So it\u2019s very difficult to bifurcate between the market growth and the company specific growth. But I can just tell you that we are making great progress and we will let the numbers speak for themselves.","Joe Giordano","And then maybe last, if you could do your kind of wrap up of everything on year?","Dave Zapico","Sure. Yeah.","Joe Giordano","Yeah.","Dave Zapico","Yeah. If I go around the horn with market segment commentary, our process -- I will start with process. Our process businesses had outstanding start to the year. Overall sales were up mid-teens. The growth was mid single-digit organically and contributions from the acquisitions of SoundCom, Forza, Telcellular and Spectro Scientific.","Our Materials Analysis business did saw particularly strong and broad-based growth and they are continuing to see solid demand for their high end analytical instrumentation. So that team has done an excellent job. For all of 2019, we continue to expect organic sales to be up mid-single digits.","Our Aerospace and Defense business delivered excellent results as I talked about before, high single-digit organic growth for the quarter. Our growth remains solid across our various Aerospace markets with notable strength across our Military and Commercial OEM businesses. For all of 2019, we continue to expect mid single-digit organic sales growth with balanced growth across each market.","For our Power and Industrial sub-segment, we saw mid single-digit growth in the first -- we saw mid single-digit growth in the first quarter and that was driven by the recent acquisition of Motec. Organic sales were flat in the quarter for Power and Industrial in line with our expectations. We had a difficult prior year comparison in our Power Test and Measurement business. And for all of 2019, we continue to expect low-to-mid single-digit organic growth, driven by the strength of our backlog and the solid order patterns that we are seeing across these businesses.","And finally for our Automation and Engineered Solutions, we saw growth across those businesses. They remain solid with mid single-digit organic sales growth in the quarter. We continue to see excellent growth from our Dunkermotoren business tied to the automation macro trend in serving. In addition, we saw notable strength across our Engineered Medical Components businesses in the quarter. That team is really doing a fantastic job, the EMC business. And for all of 2019, we continue to expect solid mid single-digit organic sales growth for our Automation and Engineer Solutions business. So, thank you, that\u2019s a walk around the horn, Joe.","Joe Giordano","Thank you.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our following question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ken Newman","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Ken Newman on for Steve.","Dave Zapico","Good morning, Ken.","Bill Burke","Good morning.","Ken Newman","Good morning. Hey. I just wanted to clarify, so the hurdle rates within your M&A pipeline haven\u2019t changed in terms of deal size and return metrics and multiples versus what you have said on prior calls. Is that correct?","Dave Zapico","No change.","Ken Newman","No change. So, on the larger end then that $300 million to $500 million in revenue type size or deal size is probably at the upper echelon?","Dave Zapico","Correct.","Ken Newman","Okay. And then it does seem, as my follow-on, it seems that you are pretty positive on the end markets outside of maybe some uncertainty from trade policy, but given maybe some of the conservatism in your guidance. I am curious to hear what your view is on the cycle, where do you think -- what inning do you think we are in right now and how much more legs does this cycle have you think?","Dave Zapico","They are very difficult to predict. As we communicated early in the year, we expect solid growth this year, but it\u2019s -- the growth is going to moderate a bit. And it\u2019s driven by the trade tensions, the global macro uncertainty, and additionally, we have some very difficult comps. And we are staying close to Asia, because of the trade difficulties, but overall, it feels pretty good and where our guys typically a bit conservative. And we are waiting to see things play out, but we feel good about the year.","Ken Newman","Got it. Last one from me and I am sorry if I missed it, how much of the $80 million in OpEx savings have been realized in the first quarter?","Dave Zapico","$18 million of the $80 million, right on our plan\u2026","Ken Newman","Okay.","Dave Zapico","\u2026 and that accelerate a bit as we progressed through the year.","Ken Newman","Thanks a lot.","Dave Zapico","Thank you, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy","You can\u2019t get rid of me it\u2019s more like a bad penny. So just a couple of more since we are round it out for the hour. Touching on your Asia comments, I mean, obviously, you are not exactly a bellwether like three in terms of broad octopus touching every different end market, but you did highlight kind of some incremental softness coming in the February some uncertainty, even the March rebounding. And I think you made a comment about Asia as a whole, right, versus China specifically. So maybe you could just amplify your comments there in terms of what you are seeing -- in terms of what\u2019s going on?","Dave Zapico","Yeah. So the -- as I said, Asia was roughly flat. China sales were down mid-single digits, against a difficult comp. We have done very well over there for the better part of two years. And while the China orders were up, low-single digits for Q1, so similar to Asia, we had tremendous order input in China in March. I mentioned the dynamic of slow February tied to the Chinese New Year.","The other thing our MAT business our Materials Analysis business had a great quarter in China and some of our project businesses with difficult comps were off a little bit. So when you look at China as a whole, we had the good orders in line with low-single digits for Q1 and for the full year for China, we expect the growth to be in line with the 3% to 5% of all of AMETEK.","So it\u2019s moderating from the double-digit growth for past couple of years, but still solid and we are still staying close of that, but there was a bit of uncertainty. It\u2019s the one uncertainty that we are watching closely because of the global trade situation.","Robert McCarthy","Two more if you will forgive me. One you were mail wanted to ask about Brexit, any kind of impact there that we should be thinking about?","Dave Zapico","Yeah. The U.K. accounts for about 4% of AMETEK sales. We are preparing for our Brexit. So we are not assuming there is a political solution. Now the can\u2019s been kicked down the road, it\u2019s delayed until the fall. Certainly there maybe some administrative issues that may cause delays in getting product in and out of Europe into the Mainland, but our businesses are very in tune with the issue. We probably are carrying about a million pounds of inventory to different preposition to make sure them that we are going to be able to sustain a short-term problem, but we -- our businesses from the U.K. to a lot of exporting already not to the Mainland. So we not from the U.K., there may be some administrative issues in the short-term and we are hoping for a solution, but again preparing for hard Brexit.","Robert McCarthy","And then finally just on the M&A environment, obviously, what you guys ultimately do, you go out and buy these private companies, closely held companies, some public companies, but ultimately make them a heck of a lot better and create a lot of value, which is wonderful. And as you know got work as a compounder. But I guess the question I have is for given the prevailing environment, where valuations are, where funding is an optionality. How do you think about the potential for select divestitures in the portfolio and how do you think about the repurchase option which you obviously hit the ignition on over the last six months?","Dave Zapico","Yeah. Our number one priority for capital allocation is to support our capital and acquisitions, and buy good businesses and make them better, that\u2019s generated long-term return for our shareholders and it\u2019s a clear priority.","At the end of last year, we have an opportunistic approach to buybacks. Our stock and a significant market dislocation and we deployed a significant amount of capital and bought back some shares in the low \u201870s that will take a good move at this time. And then the priority three for the capital allocation will be a modest consistent dividend.","In terms of your other question about our portfolio, we are in process of completing our annual strategic review. This is where we closely look at all elements of our portfolio. In the review last year, we concluded that we are very comfortable with our portfolio and we are clear profitable growth opportunities for each of our businesses.","So our strategy is to focus on a broad diverse set of niche markets and we don\u2019t want to become exposed to any one single market customer, technology and but we haven\u2019t completed our review that you share. We do it every year and we go through that review and may come to a different decision we will let you know, but we are comfortable with our performance.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks again for your time.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Bill Burke","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Hey. Good morning, Dave, Kevin and Bill. How\u2019s it going?","Dave Zapico","Whatever -- wherever that in.","Scott Graham","Yeah. I mean I was napping there. I don\u2019t know what happened on the queue here, but I saw -- I just took a nap, but Rob was right, the quarter was boringly comfortable.","Dave Zapico","I am wondering how Rob got two questions and before you got one.","Scott Graham","I think, Rob, got about nine in, but that\u2019s\u2026","Dave Zapico","That\u2019s said.","Scott Graham","That\u2019s good. He -- this is good questions as usual. I do have three more, believe or not. So I just want to understand the cadence of organic that you are thinking this year. Obviously you kind of came in at the high end this quarter on the organic. But also obviously if you look at the stack comp, your second half comps kind of jump up 200 basis points versus the first half. So would -- are you guys kind of thinking that 3 to 5 kind of comes a little heavier in the first half and in the second half?","Dave Zapico","Not really. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. I mean, we grew sales at organically at the high end of our guidance range and it\u2019s still early in the year and we want to be prudent. So that will be the biggest driver. As we mentioned before, we do have some tough comps and that\u2019s driving some moderating growth, but we are feeling good with how the year is playing out nicely one more behind us.","Scott Graham","And I guess this is next. One is a question for both you and Bill. As I know from his history, you typically can really get some good working capital out of your acquisitions after that first, six to 12 months kind of thing. Could we expect an acceleration in free cash flow as the year progresses?","Bill Burke","I would say that the free cash flow probably be a little more heavily weighted into the back half of the year than it is in the front half. And I think it\u2019s, as you, as you mentioned, we were able to drive the benefits from businesses that are now inside the AMETEK portfolio for a longer period of time as well as getting after improving working capital performance across all of our base businesses.","Scott Graham","Got it. Thank you, Will. So my last question is kind going back to an earlier question on M&A, but more specifically, on the segments. There has been a profound difference in M&A, in EIG versus EMG. And I am just trying to wonder why that is I mean I am looking at the organics from electromechanical over the last couple of years they have been outstanding. And I am also thinking that I know you are into the connectivity saying and Dunkermotoren is on that side of the house. So kind of like what\u2019s going on there that is not where we are not seeing more M&A on that side of the house?","Bill Burke","Yes. We are seeing some M&A have set out. We did major aerospace last year and we are actively looking in all of our businesses, put together a strategic plan and we look at those opportunities. And when you look at the characteristics of differentiation, we have very differentiated businesses with Dunkermotorenwith our aerospace presence.","So our aerospace business had an outstanding quarter. So we are looking at that both sides of our house. And I think over the past 10 years, there\u2019s one point EIG and EMG were about the same size and EIG is just grown a little bit bigger. So there is clearly a strong desire to do acquisitions on either side of the business.","Scott Graham","Would you maybe as a corollary to that, would you say that this is my speculation of course, aerospace particularly aftermarket oriented as well as connectivity assets, which are on the electromechanical side of the house that the prices for those deals are a little higher than what you would want for your ROIC or is that just a bad guess\u2026","Bill Burke","I wouldn\u2019t say that - I wouldn\u2019t say that. The pricing is really dependent on the niche market that we are looking and the expectations of the sellers. So I wouldn\u2019t say that I mean, there is a big difference between EIG and EMG from the product portfolio. EIG has a lot of direct and aftermarket with the end users and EMG in large part is a OEM supplier, except for the aerospace business. So, but really we are looking on both sides and I wouldn\u2019t draw anything from your prior point.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.","Kevin Coleman","Great, thank you, Sydney. Thank you everyone for joining today.

AMETEK delivered excellent performance in the fourth quarter, capping another year with exceptional results, highlighted by strong sales growth, outstanding operating performance and robust capital deployment on strategic acquisitions. In 2019, we achieved records for essentially all key financial metrics, including sales, EBITDA, operating income, earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. As a result of this strong cash flow and consistent cash flow, we successfully deployed $1.1 billion on 2 strategic acquisitions. These excellent results are driven by the AMETEK Growth Model and the efforts of our talented employees worldwide. AMETEK is committed to our mission of solving our customers' most complex challenges with differentiated technology solutions and delivering long-term sustainable success for our stakeholders.","Now on to the details of the fourth quarter results. Sales in the quarter were a record $1.3 billion, up 3% over the same period in 2018. Recent acquisitions contributed 5%. Organic sales were down 1.5%, and currency was a 0.5 point headwind. Fourth quarter operating income increased 6% to $298 million. Reported operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 22.8%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating income margins expanded an outstanding 90 basis points over the prior year.","EBITDA was a record $354 million in the quarter, up 7% over 2018 fourth quarter. Earnings for the fourth quarter increased 13% to $1.08 per diluted share, outperforming our guidance range of $1.01 to $1.03. Our businesses also generated a record $342 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, a 16% increase over last year's fourth quarter. This led to a superb cash conversion ratio of 137% for the quarter.","Now on to the fourth quarter details for our operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered strong operating performance with solid sales growth and margin execution. EIG's fourth quarter sales were a record $880 million, up 7% year-on-year driven by contributions from recent acquisitions. Organic sales and currency were both flat in the quarter. EIG continues to drive meaningful efficiency and productivity improvements through our operational excellence initiatives. These efforts led to another quarter of strong operating performance. EIG's operating income in the quarter was a record $230 million, a 7% increase over the same quarter in 2018. Reported operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 26.1%. Excluding acquisitions, operating margins expanded 60 basis points.","The Electromechanical Group also delivered a solid quarter with strong operating performance. EMG sales were $425 million in the quarter, down 5% versus prior year, with organic sales down 4% and currency a 1 point headwind. The lower sales were driven largely by continued softness across our automation markets. Despite the softness, the EMG group responded with solid operating performance. Operating income in the quarter was $85 million with reported operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 19.9%. Excluding acquisitions, operating margin increased 70 basis points over the prior year period.","Now for the full year results. 2019 was an exceptional year for AMETEK with record results. Overall sales were up 6.5% to $5.2 billion. Full year operating income was $1.2 billion, increasing 9% over the prior year, and reported margins were up 60 basis points to 22.8%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins expanded an impressive 100 basis points over 2018.","EBITDA for the year was a record $1.4 billion, up 10% over 2018 and 26.9% of sales. This led to outstanding profit growth with earnings per diluted share of $4.19, an increase of 14% over last year's comparable basis and well above our initial 2019 guidance range of $3.95 to $4.05.","I would like to thank all AMETEK colleagues for their exceptional efforts during the quarter and throughout the entire year.","Before I discuss our 2020 outlook, I wanted to touch on some of the highlights from 2019 that relate to the AMETEK Growth Model. I'll begin with acquisitions. We had another exciting year on the acquisition front, deploying nearly $1.1 billion on 2 highly strategic acquisitions: Pacific Design Technologies and Gatan. This follows an equally strong 2018 where we also deployed $1.1 billion on acquisitions. And we're off to a good start in 2020, announcing the acquisition of IntelliPower this morning.","IntelliPower is a leading provider of high-reliability, ruggedized uninterruptible power systems for mission-critical defense and industrial applications. IntelliPower is a leader in the niche markets given their unique technology and expertise. Their products and solutions perfectly complement our power systems and instruments businesses and deepen our expertise in high reliability power protection applications. Annual sales for IntelliPower are approximately $40 million, and we deployed $115 million on the acquisition.","We remain very confident on our ability to identify, acquire and integrate excellent businesses into AMETEK. Our acquisition process, from deal sourcing to due diligence to integration, is a core competency at AMETEK. Our pipeline remains strong, and we look forward to another excellent year.","In addition to these acquisitions, we made the strategic decision to divest our Reading Alloys business as part of our portfolio review process. We entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business to Kymera International in an all-cash transaction valued at $250 million. This transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.","As a leading provider of highly engineered materials, Reading Alloys experienced solid growth in sales and profitability since being acquired by AMETEK in 2008. As we continue to evolve our portfolio to high-end, differentiated technology solutions with less cyclicality, we thought it was appropriate to explore options for the business. In the end, we believe this is an excellent outcome for all parties, as Kymera is an excellent partner for Reading to support their next stage of growth.","For AMETEK, proceeds from the sale will be redeployed on our acquisition strategy, which remains our #1 priority for capital deployment. I would like to thank the Reading Alloys employees for their hard work and contributions to AMETEK and wish them continued success in the future.","Our operational excellence strategy continues to drive record results and impressive efficiency improvements. In 2019, we generated approximately $95 million in operational excellence savings. This level of savings is an increase from our initial estimate of $80 million and speaks to the flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model to drive higher levels of productivity in the face of softening market conditions.","Our businesses continued to utilize our operational excellence toolkit to improve efficiencies and productivity. A great example of these efforts came from our new instruments team, which won the Dr. John Lux Operational Excellence Award in 2019. During the year, the new instruments team conducted an operational excellence Kaizen and implemented lean processes to reduce the manufacturing cycle time of their scientific instruments for elemental and isotopic analysis. These changes drove a 40% reduction in working capital, shortened lead times for their customers and improved sales and profit growth at the business. Congratulations to the new instruments team on this outstanding achievement. This is one of the many examples across AMETEK, of our businesses driving meaningful productivity improvements through leveraging our operational excellence tools.","Our businesses also continued to enhance our competitive positions through new product development and global and market expansion. In 2019, our businesses unveiled dozens of innovative new products and solutions. These solutions included award-winning advanced 3D scanners for quality control and quality assurance, revolutionary plasma-viewing technology for laboratory analysis, high-speed digital imaging technology, highly specialized test and measurement devices and x-ray microanalysis instrumentation. We remain focused on investing in this innovation to power our future.","In 2019, we invested approximately $260 million, or about 5% of sales in the research, development and engineering of new products and solutions. These new technologies have been well received by our customers, as shown by our Vitality Index, which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions introduced within the last 3 years. In the fourth quarter, our Vitality Index was an outstanding 25%, speaking to the success of our product development efforts.","Our businesses are also expanding our global footprint to reach customers in new geographies and adjacent markets. As an example, in 2019, we unveiled new Technology Solution Centers in both Singapore and France. These state-of-the-art facilities enable our businesses to showcase their products and solutions and better serve their customers with design, implementation, calibration and service capabilities. We remain focused on investing in these opportunities to expand our international sales channels and develop new innovative ways to better serve our customers and support our global growth initiatives.","Now I'll move to our outlook for 2020. While we remain cautious, given the current uncertainties of the global macro environment, we are highly confident in the strength of the AMETEK Growth Model, and in our ability to continue to deliver strong performance. As such, we expect 2020 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.38, an increase of 1% to 5% over 2019's comparable result. This guidance range assumes the divestiture of Reading Alloys during the first quarter and excludes the gain on the anticipated sale.","Overall sales in 2020 are expected to be up low single digits, with organic sales roughly flat for the year. For the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up low single digits versus the prior year.","First quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.04 per diluted share, a 1% to 4% increase over the prior year period.","So in summary, AMETEK delivered excellent performance in the fourth quarter, concluding a year with exceptional results and a decade that saw a tremendous growth for our AMETEK shareholders. The AMETEK Growth Model is proven and scalable and will continue to drive long-term sustainable success for our stakeholders.","I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?","William Burke","Thank you, Dave. As Dave mentioned, AMETEK completed 2019 with excellent performance in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for both the quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were down modestly from the prior year and, as a percentage of sales, were 1.3%, down from last year's level of 1.5% of sales. In 2020, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales, in line with the full year 2019.","The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17.6%, down from last year's adjusted rate of 22.8%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was due to the tax benefits from stock compensation and the finalization of our 2018 tax returns. For 2020, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was excellent at 17.3%, down from 18.2% in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $41 million in the fourth quarter and $102 million for the full year. We expect capital expenditures in 2020 to be at a similar level to 2019 at approximately 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model.","Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $64 million, and the full year was $234 million. In 2020, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $265 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $120 million or $0.52 per diluted share.","As Dave has highlighted, our businesses continued to generate tremendous levels of cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record $342 million, up 16% over last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow was also outstanding, up 15% versus the prior year to $301 million. Free cash flow conversion was exceptional at 137% of net income.","Our full year cash flow levels were also at records. Operating cash flow for 2019 was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $1 billion, each increasing 20% over 2018. Free cash flow conversion in 2019 was an outstanding 118%.","We continue to successfully deploy our strong cash flow on strategic acquisitions. We had another outstanding year in 2019 with $1.1 billion deployed on the acquisitions of Pacific Design Technologies and Gatan. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we deployed $115 million on the acquisition of IntelliPower.","In addition, in the fourth quarter, we paid off $100 million of private placement senior notes, which matured in the quarter. Total debt at December 31 was $2.77 billion, up 5% from the end of 2018. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $393 million, resulting in a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.7x at year-end, consistent with year-end 2018.","Following the acquisition of IntelliPower, we have approximately $1.4 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth investments.","To finish, I'd like to echo Dave in thanking our colleagues for their excellent work in 2019. Our businesses delivered exceptional performance in the quarter and throughout the entire year. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2020 with a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?","Kevin Coleman","Great. Thank you, Bill. Andrew, can we please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.","Matt Summerville","A couple of questions. First, Dave, can you maybe talk about what your expectation is from a purely an organic standpoint as we sort of cadence throughout the year from quarter-to-quarter, maybe first half versus back half embedded in your guidance?","David Zapico","Yes. Sure, Matt. Really, when we think about our guidance for organic growth in 2020, we're really assuming the same activity level that we saw in the fourth quarter and similar run rates expected throughout all of 2020. So there isn't a back-end hockey stick at all on our forecast. It follows a pretty typical H1, H2 of AMETEK.","And now in terms of what it will look like as you proceed through the year, you'll have some negative organic growth comps during the first quarter - or the first half. But in terms of the level of activity, it's pretty linear sequentially and reflects the continuation of the pace of activity we saw in Q4 '19.","Matt Summerville","And then just as a follow-up. Can you do sort of your traditional walk through the businesses, what you saw in Q4 and kind of what the expectation is for 2020 across the portfolio?","David Zapico","Sure, Matt. I'll start with our Process business. They completed an excellent year in 2019 with a solid fourth quarter. Overall sales were up high single digits driven by contributions from acquisitions of Telular, Spectro Scientific and Gatan. Organic sales were flat in the quarter, generally in line with our expectations. However, we did see some slower discretionary CapEx at year-end. For 2020, we expect organic sales to be roughly flat versus 2019 for Process.","Next, Aerospace. Overall sales for Aerospace & Defense businesses were up low single digits in the fourth quarter driven by the acquisition of PDT. Organic sales were down low single digits against a very difficult comp with a plus 10% Q4 '18 in last year's fourth quarter. We saw excellent mid-single-digit growth across our Aerospace & Defense platform in 2019. In 2020, we expect another solid year of growth across our A&D businesses with organic sales up low to mid-single digits and balanced growth across each segment.","Organic sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up low single digits in the quarter, with particularly solid growth in our Programmable Power business. And for 2020, we expect organic sales to be roughly flat across Power & Industrial.","And our Automation & Engineered Solutions business saw a mid-single-digit organic sales decline in the fourth quarter driven by continued softness across our global Automation businesses. In 2020, we expect our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses organic sales to be roughly flat versus the prior year. That's the roundabout, Matt.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt.","Scott Graham","So a couple of questions. The oil and gas piece, I know, is a piece that has obviously been managed down over time. Acquisition is the whole thing. But obviously, that's taken - that market has taken a quite the turn for the worse with the coronavirus really kind of upsetting the sales side of things, I think, in the upstream. And I was just wondering kind of what you were thinking on oil and gas for the year. And then I do have a follow-up on the Automation business.","David Zapico","Okay. Yes. Our - we - in Q4, our Oil & Gas business was flat. There was some - it performed well. There was some project timing in the Middle East, but it had a flat performance. And for the full year, it was up mid-single-digits. And for '20 - for full year '20, we expect a flat performance, and we have a smaller upstream presence. Over 2\/3 of our presence has been downstream. So it's about a 6% exposure for the whole company, about $300 million. And it's been growing, and we've grown around it. And the one point is, if you think back into the 2015, 2016 time period, the commodity-related businesses of AMETEK were 22% of our sales. After the - announcing the divestiture of Reading Alloys, that same commodity level businesses will be about 12% of our sales. So 6% oil and gas, 6% of metals. So we feel really good about our portfolio. We feel good about our exposures. And with the predominant Oil & Gas businesses in the mid and downstream, it looks solid. And we're still at that $50 an order, $50 a barrel level, when in past has been okay for us. So we're feeling pretty good about it, and we have some good projects that we're working on. And we have a good recurring revenue base in that part of the business.","Scott Graham","My follow-up on automation is simply could you kind of break that up by end market where things are weakest. I'm assuming that oil - that auto still goes in the lost column for now, but maybe just a little more color on that business.","David Zapico","If you want to understand that business, what really happened is the automation weakness continued, and the European automation was weaker than expected. So if you think back to last quarter, Europe was kind of strong, and Asia was the weak spot for automation. The U.S. - this quarter, the U.S. was positive. The weak spot was really Europe. So Europe and Asia maintained weakness, and that's really the story in the Automation business.","Now a little bit of encouragement is in December and January, sequentially, the orders normalized. So we seemed to have found bottom, and we'll see if that continues. But it's pretty much a geographical issue where the European weakness was the unanticipated weakness in Q4.","Scott Graham","That's hugely helpful. If I could just sneak this last one in. It's a quick one. What's your productivity expectation for 2020?","David Zapico","Yes. The productivity expectation for 2020 is $90 million. So we began 2019 at $80 million. And through the year, we were - executed very well. We ended up at $95 million. But for 2020, for the start of the year, we set that at $90 million incremental. These are all incremental numbers. Those are incremental productivity numbers that you'll see working through the P&L.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","I might have missed this, but could you tell us what the organic orders were for the segments? And maybe some comments versus expectations.","David Zapico","Yes, sure. I'll go through the whole orders pitch. I mean, it was - orders growth 8 - up 8% in the quarter. Organic orders were down 2%. And both groups were down low single digits. And as I said before, the weakness was driven by the automation and weaker year-end discretionary CapEx spending. And we're seeing - now with January and into the late parts of December, we're seeing sequential orders stabilized with our Automation business. And we have a record backlog of $1.72 billion, and we have a book-to-bill of 1.07 in the quarter. So that's the whole picture on orders, Deane.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then, look, the question, does your - this quarter, everyone's being asked how braced you are for disruptions in China. Is that about 9% of your revenues? Just in terms of potential demand disruptions and supply chain disruptions, is there anything embedded in your guidance for that? And kind of what near-term expectations do you have?","David Zapico","Yes. The first point, it's about 7% of our sales, and we're monitoring things very closely. And first and foremost, we're focused on the safety of our employees, well-being of our employees. And from a business perspective, as you know, the situation is very fluid and difficult to quantify, so our full year guidance is based on what we know now. And we do know that we don't have any significant operations in Wuhan and - nor any significant supply chain exposure to suppliers in the Wuhan City area. But we don't expect - we do expect there to be some delays in the global supply chain and some unanticipated consequences of the supply chain disruptions. So we'll monitor this closely. And we do have very global supply chain capability, so we'll adjust as possible and appropriate. It's very difficult at this point to assess any end demand risk without knowing the severity or longevity of the situation.","And one point to highlight how fluid the situation is or - although our facilities in China have not reopened following the Lunar New Year, they'll reopen next week. One of our facilities is the Chinese government asked us to reopen to operate in order to provide support to a couple of medical device manufacturers that we have in China. We provide motion control solutions to our customers who supply medical equipment used to help to detect the coronavirus. So we're up and running today with a line to fill that need. So it's really changing all the time. And I think we've taken the steps to focus on the safety of both our employees in China and around the world. And as we learn more and we quantify it, we'll let you know what that is.","Deane Dray","Dave, that's real helpful. If I could just squeeze one more in regarding the topic of other potential divestitures. We really did like seeing trimming the Reading Alloys business. I know it's a good business, but the cyclicality didn't quite match what you're looking for. Compounders don't typically divest, so - because it's really hard to redeploy and get the same returns. But just - are you looking - as you look at the portfolio, are there any other potential candidates for trimming at the margin like that?","David Zapico","We do a strategic review every year, so we look hard at our portfolio. And Reading Alloys, as you mentioned, is a really good business. And it was just different for AMETEK. And it was more cyclical. And the value chain was different, where we didn't have the visibility that we have in our other businesses dealing with end customers. So it kind of stood out, and we made the decision to divest it. And it was a good decision. We still have a solid metals business, and we're very comfortable with our portfolio. And no other divestitures are planned at this time.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Just a follow-up on Deane's question on the portfolio. I guess, one of the unintended consequences of being kind of a long-term compounder with a good amount of success on the M&A side is that you need to do either larger deals or have higher velocity to kind of keep the momentum going. Clearly, 2019 was good evidence of both. When you look at the pipeline today, is it a bias toward larger acquisitions? And should we see that become more of the norm?","David Zapico","Yes, it's a great question, Josh. I mean, there are clearly some larger acquisitions on our pipeline, but there are also some smaller-sized acquisitions, too, more typical, and - like the IntelliPower one that you saw that we announced today. And as you know, acquisitions are our first priority for capital deployment. We want to deploy all of our free cash flow on M&A. And we had a successful 2019, and we had a successful 2018. If you look over those last 2 years, we completed 9 acquisitions. We deployed about $2.3 billion, and we acquired $610 million in sales. And I would say, our deal funnel remains consistent, so that we should be able to do the same kind of thing going forward. And we're - feels very good right now. We're evaluating a number of opportunities. As Bill mentioned, we have $1.4 billion of existing firepower with unused revolver capacity and cash. And even with these capital outlays, our - we're going to generate another - anticipate to generate another $1.1 billion in free cash flow. So we're very active. We have a team dedicated to it. The acquisitions at AMETEK are a combination of a set of well-defined processes, not a single event. And we have processes to develop the pipeline, and I feel really good about that right now.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it. That's helpful. And I guess, related to that, the productivity bogey for 2020 looks very solid. I guess, is part of this kind of ramp in productivity given that there are a lot of newer members of the AMETEK portfolio and running them through that operational rigor just leads to larger numbers? Or is there kind of another element of the productivity deck that you guys are unrolling?","David Zapico","Yes, I think it's a combination of both. The acquisitions do provide more opportunities. But at the same time, our growth model is very flexible. And when we get in times, like where the revenue starts to slow down, you saw it the last couple of quarters. We've been, business by business, looking at businesses and taking actions. And it's resulted in extremely strong execution and excellent margins. And we're continuing to get excellent pricing. We're continuing to get excellent productivity. So we really expect another strong year of execution in 2020, and it's really inherent in our model. We have operators that know how to run businesses through the cycle. And when the revenue line starts to waver a bit, then we know what to do. And we have a variety of contingencies planed. So I feel comfortable managing in this kind of environment.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","And if I can just sneak one small one in at the end here. Clearly, CapEx budgets are still very uncertain given all that's going on in the world. Any sense from customers that there's a bit of a coiled spring being formed and that there's projects that are set to release when we kind of get the all clear? Or are people just comfortable spending at lower levels?","David Zapico","With the trade deals that recently have been signed, there's a bit of a momentum building. And now you're dealing with the coronavirus situation. So it's kind of tough to get a read. But certainly, we're feeling some positive momentum building. And it felt like people were willing to spend. And now we just have to see the impact.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","So your comments on December, January were interesting because it's sort of very opposite to what we're hearing elsewhere. And I think your comments were more Europe, Asia as being weaker. And therefore, I'm wondering if you're seeing more stability in those regions. But my real question is more on the sequential Q-over-Q decline at EMG. It was down 8%, which tends to speak to some channel destocking activities. I'm just wondering if you could touch on that and then just a comment on the sort of regional stability question as well.","David Zapico","Yes. I mean, in the EMG, typically, parts of that business do have a slower fourth quarter historically, the calendar year. And it was relatively typical. The European Automation business was - we highlighted also on our Aerospace business, our military business is in the EMG segment, and that saw some program delays, that things were just delayed a bit. So - but as I said, the business has operated very well. We had excellent margin expansion. And certainly, that's - the Automation business has been challenged throughout the year, and the team there has done an excellent job of taking actions. And those are included in the results. We haven't spiked those out because it's just an individual business. That's what we do. And I - that's where we're at, at EMG. It's really automation-driven. It's European automation specifically, and there was a little bit of the military. That's just a timing issue. We have a very good backlog, but just a timing issue in Q4.","In terms of the globe, we were solid growth in the U.S., while Europe and Asia were down in the quarter. So we had low single-digit growth in the U.S., particularly in Process and Power. And the Asia was down mid-single digits and similar to performance we had in Q3. And Europe was the change. And when we look at 2020, we expect the U.S. to do a little better. And maybe the international market is a little worse, but there is a small difference between them. So as I said, we set our plan for 2020 at the same activity level we saw in Q4. We feel pretty confident with that.","Nigel Coe","That's helpful. And your comment - I think you mentioned the book-to-bill was 1.07 in the quarter. Is that correct?","David Zapico","Yes.","Nigel Coe","Yes, that seems like a good number. I mean, I don't have the book-to-bill from last fourth quarter, 4Q '18. How does that 1.07 compare to sort of your normal book rate during 4Q?","David Zapico","Yes. I think that also has the acquisitions in that, where you're booking the backlog of the acquisition. So I think if you normalize out for the acquisitions, it will be around 1 approximately.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And that would be fairly normal.","David Zapico","Yes, that's fairly normal.","Nigel Coe","And just a quick one on D&A. I think you said $265 million for 2020. And that breaks up as $145 million for intangibles and then $120 million tangible.","William Burke","It's about - for 2020, it's about $160 million for amortization and depreciation about $105 million. And then - yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","So on record backlog, just wondering if you see kind of normal conversion going forward. It sounds like the military delays helped the backlog a little bit, so wondering if that is just kind of a one quarter push in your view and if EMG organic, kind of, is a little less negative most likely in the first quarter.","David Zapico","Yes. The EMG - the military is definitely going to correct itself, but the comps in Q1 are very difficult for EMG. So it will be roughly sequentially similar to the level it was in Q4. That would be the best way I can describe that, Chris. And did you have another question?","Christopher Glynn","Yes. I'm dealing one - other one right now. A lot has been asked is EMG, I missed acquisition component in the quarter. I did get Pacific in there, but I didn't hear you mention any acquisition contribution.","David Zapico","Yes. There was an acquisition component in EMG in the fourth quarter. It was about 1 point.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.","Allison Poliniak","Just want to follow along on Josh's comment on acquisition - or his question. You clearly had a strong year. But as we enter 2020, we talked about size, but has your thought process around technology or end markets changed as you look for deals?","David Zapico","That's a great question. I mean, certainly, it's a similar-type businesses that we're looking for. We're looking for businesses that are noncyclical, businesses that have a good percentage of recurring revenue. If we can't find those types of things, we're looking for the return in an existing - around an existing exposure. And we have teams out there beating the bushes, digging up potential deals in many of these companies we've been following for years and years, so - and when AMETEK is looking at buying a business, it's often the ownership - the private ownership they want to retire or they're trying to - it's not how the stock market is doing or things like that. And the example of IntelliPower, we had a CEO that wanted to retire.","And we've been working with them for years. So that's more of the type of deals that we're going to get during this time, and there's a wide horizon. But we're looking in the health care area. We're looking to extend our Process and analytical businesses, Aerospace, Power, it's all the above. We won't buy any cost-driven businesses that went in the market on cost. We're looking for differentiated businesses. That's our key criteria. And because we've been doing this so long, we have approximately 11 people dedicated to it. We know what's going on, and we feel good about the pipeline now. It's always difficult to predict when you're going to do a deal, if it's next quarter or not or - but I feel really good about the pipeline right now.","Allison Poliniak","No, that's great. And then just a last one on IntelliPower. Seems like a nice complement. What does it bring to AMETEK that may be a technology or whatever that you did not have before? Any color there?","David Zapico","Yes, sure. I mean, the big thing, we already have an existing presence in uninterruptible power supplies. And we sell it to the life sciences market, we sell it to the process market. And what IntelliPower brings is really those products, ruggedized uninterruptible power systems sold to mission-critical defense and industrial applications. So they're the largest supplier of ruggedized UPSs for the DoD. They serve a robust set of key programs and applications. Their products include UPS, power conditioners, external battery packs, power distribution units. And they're really a unique company in that they have a sole-source provider for numerous programs. They're on ships, land vehicles, ground stations, mobile networks, so with a blue-chip customer base. And they also have an industrial component that we think we can grow. So we're pretty happy with the acquisition, and there's a meaningful synergy opportunity. It's a mid-single-digit grower, strong visibility on revenue in the short term, solid management team remaining with the business, so we like the deal.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ivana Delevska with Gordon Haskett.","Ivana Delevska","So just wanted to ask about some of your higher-growth businesses, like Telular, Spectro and Creaform. Are they getting affected by the weaker macro at all?","David Zapico","Those are in our EIG segment and in our Process segment. And that businesses - those businesses are holding up very well. We did see some - we usually see a year-end - some capital spending and capital pledge, where people spend their capital at year-end, and that was a bit lighter. But overall, those businesses are doing very well.","Ivana Delevska","And then just one follow up on Gatan. How did the performance in the quarter and the current outlook compare to your acquisition plan?","David Zapico","Right, great question. I mean, the business performed well. It was a bit better than our forecast. So we're very pleased with that performance. And we also announced the combination of Gatan with another business unit within AMETEK. So that was announced in January, and it will drive a substantial synergy as we have really the same customer base. And I would characterize the integration as proceeding very well.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stephens.","Robert McCarthy","I guess the first question I would have is around the orders - the organic orders. Anything you can talk about the backlog in terms of price and how you feel about price because price is such a key lever for you, not only for, obviously, growth organically, but also for really shoring up your incremental margin conversion?","David Zapico","Yes. I mean, the price that we got in the fourth quarter was much like full year '19. So we had a positive spread of about 50 bps and very pleased with the results. And for '20, we expect about a 50 bp spread. Now we think there might be slightly lower inflation, about 1%. And the pricing that we have built into our operating model is about 1.5 points. But we expect a 50 basis point spread, improving productivity for next year. And we're confident that we're going to be able to deliver that because we've been performing so well over the past couple of years. And it is a bit lower than 2019, and that's because the incremental impact from tariffs will be lower also.","Robert McCarthy","Remind us what your pricing was in kind of the '15, '16 time frame during the teeth of the oil and gas recession. Was it a negative spread for several years?","David Zapico","I don't think it went negative, I don't think it went negative. I don't have those numbers in front of me. You can check with Kevin on that after the call, but I don't recall going negative at all.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then I guess, in terms of fourth quarter of '18, you weren't afraid at that time, and there was a pretty material drawdown in the market, obviously, to deploy capital for share repurchase when you thought it was prudent. Given the prospect that we might have a year of unclear macro, given the coronavirus, geopolitical trends, the election, it could be harder to transact on deals given kind of a tacit bid\/ask spread in terms of properties, meaning people have a higher justification for selling than perhaps you're willing to buy, do you think you could amp up the share repurchase if you hit an air pocket in terms of the ability to transact on deals or you just don't see that happening?","David Zapico","Now it's a great question, Rob. I mean, the reality is we have a great pipeline, and we want to deploy our capital on M&A. And I think we're going to do that. But we look at our buyback strategy as more opportunistic. And we have a strong balance sheet. And if the - in the short term, there's overreaction from the marketplace, then we'll deploy our balance sheet to buybacks. But right now, we're focused on M&A.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","David Ridley-Lane","This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Curious if you expect any follow-on impact in the first half from Boeing's kind of 737 Max production cost?","David Zapico","Yes, that's a great question, David. I mean, they - we're on a lot of different programs and all commercial aircraft, military, business jets, so we're not dependent on any one aircraft. But specifically to your question, the 737 Max will be about a $10 million headwind in 2020, and that assumes a start-up of production based mid-year in our current build plan. So it's about a $10 million headwind versus 2018 - 2019, excuse me.","David Ridley-Lane","Got it. And as a quick follow-up. How did EMG bookings, maybe the pipeline develop as you went through the quarter? And any commentary on first quarter to date?","David Zapico","Yes, yes. The EMG bookings, like I had said previously, it was weaker as the quarter started. But the orders stabilized in December, and that continued in January. So we showed a typical - fairly typical ramp in Q4 for the entire business, and EMG was included in that. And then in January, we had a good order month, right in line with our plan. And as I said, sequentially, from December, January, it feels like the EMG automation orders have stabilized and - during that short time period.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.","Andrew Buscaglia","Can you touch on - you talked about the automation weakness continuing and orders somewhat normalized December, January. But can you talk about what - I know you talked regionally, but what about your other areas of the business? What other areas normalized or weakened or got worse because the major - organic orders are down about 2% or low single digits in each business. I would think some things got worse.","David Zapico","Yes. The other thing, there's really another major factor, and I mentioned that earlier. We experienced weaker discretionary CapEx spend than we anticipated. And then the related point, and it's more of a sales issue versus an orders issue, was program delays in - and for military in our Aerospace business in the fourth quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.","Richard Eastman","Dave, just a quick question around - as you look into 2020 with kind of a flat core growth expectation, when you look at Process, and I think your commentary around the Automation business and EMG both flat-flat, it seems like Aerospace, I think you commented low single to mid-single digits. When you look at those 3 buckets of exposure, where do you see the risk to 2020 from a core growth standpoint?","David Zapico","Yes. We try to put a plan together that deal with that by taking the run rates that we're currently at. So we didn't want a hockey stick budget, and we think we have that factored in. But there's clearly risks, and they're more macroeconomic risk than AMETEK's specific risk because the businesses are executing very well. We have a record backlog. We're going to be able to execute on that backlog. We had excellent pricing in the backlog. We're showing the capability to generate excellent productivity. So we're expecting another strong year of execution. And with our crystal ball, we called it flat. And we've tried to base the run rates based on 2019 because we don't like hockey stick plans. And that's where we're at, and that's our best attempt to moderate the guidance with the realities of the market.","Richard Eastman","As you look out into 2020, so difficult to sift out op margins from acquisitions and that contribution. But what kind of improvement do you expect to see in op margins for the full year? Are we talking about maybe 50 basis points? Or what kind of...","David Zapico","Yes, we had 100 basis points in all of 2019. We had 90 basis points core margins in the fourth quarter. And in our plan, we have 30 to 40 basis points of margin improvement - core operating income margin improvement.","Richard Eastman","Okay, for '20. Okay. And then just a very last question here. Just a quick question around Gatan. You mentioned it had a good fourth quarter as it came in for the partial quarter. As we spoke when the business was acquired, I think we're thinking maybe $100 million of - or excuse me, $180 million of revenue for the - for a full year. Growth rate was mid-singles to high singles. There's been some commentary maybe a thermo kind of speaking to weakness in the electron microscope market, which I'm curious. What would be a good revenue contribution in your plan for '20 from Gatan?","David Zapico","Yes. I think it's pretty much what we laid out. It's roughly $180 million.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company.","Robert Jamieson","This is Rob Jamieson on for Joe this morning. Just a quick question on IntelliPower. Can you maybe talk about the margin profile or what your expectations for that business are?","David Zapico","Yes. It's a profitable business, and we paid 9x EBITDA, so it's - you can figure that out. It's roughly a 30% EBITDA business. And we paid $150 million, approximately 3x sales. And we think there's a meaningful synergy opportunity, so we're going to get great return for our stakeholders.","Robert Jamieson","Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the 737 Max. I know this is a small - a very small piece of your Aero's total business. But in terms of what's baked in your guide, how many planes or production number? Like, what's your production number embedded in your guidance there? Is it like 0? Or...","David Zapico","No, I think our - the number is a little bit difficult for us to forecast. And I don't know what disclosure agreements we have with Boeing. I can say that we plan on starting our activity midyear, and it would be about a $10 million headwind, yes.","Robert Jamieson","Okay. And you guys have like 37,000 per plane content-wise, right?","David Zapico","Yes, that's right.","Operator","We would like to thank you for participating in today's conference.

I'll now turn the meeting over to Frank.","Frank S. Hermance","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a solid third quarter. We established quarterly records for sales and operating income. In addition, we ended the quarter with a record backlog of $1.2 billion. Orders in the third quarter were excellent at $937 million, up 7% organically from the prior year. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.05.","Sales in the quarter were up 6% to $890 million. Organic sales were up 1% and in line with our expectations, while acquisitions added 5%, and currency was flat.","Operating income for the third quarter was strong. It increased 9% to a record $204.7 million from $188.2 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our Operational Excellence activities.","Operating income margin in the quarter was also strong at 23%, a 60-basis-point improvement over the third quarter of 2012.","Net income was up 11% to $127.9 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.52 were up 11% over last year's third quarter.","Operating working capital was 18.2% of sales in the quarter.","During the quarter, we recognized an approximately $11 million gain on the sale of a facility. This gain was offset in the quarter by increased organic growth investments and higher-than-normal acquisition-related costs. I will provide some color on these increased growth investments in a moment, but let me first discuss results of the individual operating groups.","The Electronic Instruments Group had a very good third quarter. Sales were up 9% to $499.8 million on strength in our longer-cycle aerospace and oil and gas businesses, plus the contributions from the Micro-Poise and Controls Southeast acquisitions.","We also saw strength in our Advanced Measurement Technology business. Organic sales were up 1%, acquisitions added 8%, while currency was flat.","Orders for EIG were also very strong in the quarter, up 6% organically. EIG's operating income performance was excellent. Operating income increased 14% to a record $138.9 million, and operating margins were 27.8%, up 120 basis points over last year's third quarter.","The Electromechanical Group also had a solid quarter. Sales were up 2% to $390.2 million on strength in our Precision Motion Control business and in our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business. Organic sales were up 1%, and foreign currency was a 1% tailwind. Organic orders were very strong, up 9% in the third quarter. EMG's operating income was $77.5 million, and operating margins were 19.9% in the quarter.","Given the low-growth market environment, we felt it was prudent to redeploy a portion of the facility gain into targeted organic growth investments. These growth investments are incremental to the $35 million of growth investments we had previously targeted for the full year. The investments are focused on Global & Market Expansion and new product development initiatives and are being made in specific targeted projects in support of our growth strategies. I will provide some examples of a few incremental growth investments as part of the update on our 4 growth strategies, which are Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development, Operational Excellence, and Acquisitions.","First, Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion continues to be a key driver for AMETEK's growth. In the third quarter, international sales represented 54% of our total sales, up from 52% of sales in the third quarter of 2012. The increase in international sales percentage was driven by strong Aerospace and Process sales. Our businesses have identified attractive Global & Market Expansion opportunities in service and aftermarket support for customers. A number of the growth projects undertaken in the third quarter were targeted at expanding our capability within these areas. Providing customers with high-quality service capabilities is increasingly being viewed as a key differentiator for our product sales, especially in China, India and Southeast Asia.","In addition to driving incremental aftermarket service sales, adding service and application engineers in these regions will support our product sales efforts.","Across our Process businesses, we initiated a number of service expansion projects in the quarter, including, within our Taylor Hobson, SPECTRO and oil and gas businesses.","In our Programmable Power business, we are investing in a growth project focused on expanding and strengthening our sales channel capabilities and effectiveness. This project is focused in parts of Asia where we see excellent growth opportunities for our power supply solutions within attractive test and measurement markets. These markets include semiconductor and electric vehicles.","The increased investments include additional sales and application engineering resources, increased training for our distribution partners and increased marketing spend. In addition to these incremental growth investments, we continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities.","Now on to New Products. New product development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently invested in RD&E. And in 2013, we expect to spend $178 million, a 15% increase over 2012. A number of the incremental growth investments we made in the quarter were in new product development activities.","As an example, within our Ultra Precision Technology business, we are making an incremental investment to enhance an existing surface measurement product to expand its market opportunity.","The R&D investment will be used to increase the functionality, measurement capability and ease of use of the existing product while also reducing cost. The investment is being made in design and development, testing and production build-out.","From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 21% of sales in the third quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers.","Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. Operational Excellence within AMETEK includes Lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, Design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts and the movement of production to low-cost locales. Operational Excellence also includes our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, where we continue to see excellent results.","In addition to the significant success of our global material sourcing initiatives, we continue to generate excellent results from our overall MRO and e-procurement initiatives, as well as our value engineering activities. From these combined sourcing activities, we recognized approximately $16 million in savings in the third quarter and have recognized approximately $46 million in sourcing savings year-to-date. We continue to expect at least $100 million of total cost savings in 2013.","Now turning to Acquisitions. We've had a solid year thus far in 2013 and had a very active third quarter with the acquisition of Controls Southeast during the quarter and the acquisition of Creaform, which was announced this morning. In addition, our pipeline of deals remains strong, so we expect to remain very active over the balance of 2013. Thus far in 2013, we deployed roughly $280 million in capital, acquiring approximately $100 million in revenue.","I'll provide some more insight into the Creaform acquisition. Creaform is a leading developer and manufacturer of innovative 3D measurement technologies and services. They are the industry leader in stand-alone, portable 3D scanners. Creaform's optically based devices are used across a number of high-growth applications within the aerospace, automotive and general industrial markets. Key applications for their products include reverse engineering, dimensional inspection, precision manufacturing, nondestructive testing, automated quality control and 3D printing.","Creaform is an outstanding acquisition for us and an excellent strategic fit with our Precision Technology -- Ultra Precision Technology division. Its products expand the range of our metrology product and technology offerings in a high-growth niche market in portable, noncontact metrology applications.","Creaform was privately held and has annual sales of approximately $52 million. The price paid was approximately $120 million. The business is headquartered near Qu\u00e9bec City, Canada.","Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value, especially during periods of slow growth. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus, our backlog of deals remains excellent, our balance sheet is strong, and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy.","Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2013. Our estimates for the balance of 2013 reflect the impact from the continued soft but slowly improving demand environment. We anticipate 2013 revenue to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2012. Organic growth is expected to be up low single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. We expect our earnings to be approximately $2.09 per diluted share, up 11% from 2012.","Very importantly, fourth quarter 2013 sales are expected to be up high single digits from last year's fourth quarter, with organic growth up mid-single digits on a percentage basis. We estimate our fourth quarter earnings to be approximately $0.54 per diluted share, up 10% over last year's fourth quarter.","So in summary, our overall business has performed well in the third quarter. The core sales growth, Operational Excellence initiatives and strategic growth initiatives enabled us to deliver earnings at the high end of our guidance, against the backdrop of a continued soft demand environment. We remain well positioned for the remainder of 2013. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our record level of backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2013.","Bob will now cover some of the financial deals -- details, and then we will be glad to take your questions. Bob?","Robert R. Mandos","Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a very good quarter, with solid operating performance and strong growth on orders. I will provide some further details.","In the quarter, total selling expenses were up less than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost containment. General and administrative expenses were up 1.3% of sales, in line with last year's third quarter.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29%. For 2013, we expect our tax rate to be at the low end of our prior full year estimate of 29% to 30%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.","On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 18.2% of sales in the third quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority.","Capital expenditures were $16 million for the quarter. Full year 2013 capital expenditures are expected to be $60 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $30 million for the quarter. 2013 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $118 million.","Operating cash flow was $166 million in the third quarter, and free cash flow was $151 million, representing 118% of net income. For the first 9 months of 2013, operating cash flow was $451 million and free cash flow was $414 million, representing 109% of net income. For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow to be approximately 113% of net income. Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy, where we expended approximately $160 million in the quarter.","Total debt was $1.3 billion at September 30, down $154 million from the 2012 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $255 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at September 30 of 26.3%, down from 33.8% at the end of 2012.","At September 30, we had approximately $950 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives.","Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Creaform. Capital deployed was approximately $120 million, which brings our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2013 to approximately $280 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.","In summary, we had a strong third quarter, establishing record levels for sales and operating income. We're well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a very strong balance sheet and cash flows.","Kevin C. Coleman","Great. Thank you, Bob. Myra, now, happy to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On -- Frank, on the $11 million, I guess, the gain on sale unit [ph], is there any way to quantify what in terms of that went to, I guess, the incremental growth investments?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, sure. Sure, Allison. Of that $11 million, approximately $7 million went to incremental growth initiatives, and the remaining $4 million was higher-than-normal acquisition-related costs. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have been very active in the acquisition environment, not only on the deals that we have already closed, but on other deals that we hope to close in the relatively near future. So if you look at what actually went through the P&L, about $5 million of acquisition-related costs went through the P&L, but we're saying that $4 million were incremental because we always have some residual level going through the P&L.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got you. Perfect. And then can you just touch on EMG margins? They were a bit pressured this quarter. Was there something with mix there? Or I don't know, just elaborate what's going on there.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, sure, Allison. Yes, you're right, it was a mix issue. Our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business had a tremendous quarter. Their organic sales were up about 15%, and that was one of the drivers in the performance of EMG. And as I believe you're aware, the margins in Floorcare and Specialty Motors, although very good, are below the group average. So that mix shift is what drove that slight decrease in EMG margins.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Now should we assume that mix shift continued into Q4 to some extent?","Frank S. Hermance","I think you're going to find Q4 better. We are expecting good margins in Q4. We expect Floorcare and Specialty Motors to continue to do well, but we also expect the Differentiated businesses to do better. So therefore, maybe there'll be a slight mix shift but not of the same magnitude.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Drew Ronkowitz in for Nigel Coe. Just wanted to get a sense for what end markets were driving the order growth in the quarter and then how that's going to flow into your 4Q guidance.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. Great question. It really was across the board. If you look at the 5 sub-segments that we talk about, which are basically Aerospace and the Process businesses and Power and Industrial on the EIG side, and the Differentiated and the Floorcare and Specialty Motors sub-segments on the EMG side, all of those sub-segments had mid-single-digit or greater than mid-single-digit organic growth in orders. So it was a very, very encouraging sign for us to see that sort of broad-based improvement. Within each segment, the higher than sort of the mid-single-digit levels on the EIG side, were in Aerospace, where they were up in the low double digits, and in Floorcare -- or in the EMG segment, Floorcare was actually up organically, around 20%. So very, very strong performance, really, across the company and, in particular, in those 2 groups. So your follow-on point is, obviously, as we look to the fourth quarter, we're feeling very, very good about the organic growth of the company. And you can see sort of the progression of organic growth through the year. I think we started at about minus 2% in the first quarter, and then we went to flat, and now we're at 1%, and we're saying mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. So the trend is actually similar to what we laid out at the beginning of the year, maybe a little fourth-quarter-oriented than what we had expected, but the end result is excellent, and we feel good about the fourth quarter, and we also feel good going into next year as a result.","Andrew Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, if you could, on the Creaform acquisition, just give us a sense for the competitors in the space and then maybe the margin profile as it compares to the rest of the segment.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, sure. The margin profile is less -- a little bit less than AMETEK's margins, and we see opportunity to basically grow those margins as we do with most deals. The prime driver for this business, and why we acquired it, is that it has a very high organic growth rate. Over the last 5 years, it has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of about 20%. There are not a lot of what I would call direct competitors to Creaform in this 3D, portable noncontact metrology area. But in the broader sort of noncontact metrology area, competitors would be people like Hexagon, Nikon has some business here, FARO has some business here, so those are the type of competitors that you will see, although somewhat tangential to Creaform.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt McConnell with Citi Research.","Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that 20% organic growth. What's your expectation when you come up with your deal plan? When you model this out, what are you expecting over the next couple years or so?","Frank S. Hermance","We're expecting a low single -- low double-digit types of organic growth rates. We actually modeled it a bit lower than that to make sure we were paying a proper price for it, but I think that's the expectation. And obviously, that's on the high end of the businesses that we have. So we're pretty excited about this particular deal.","Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And switching gears a little bit, you've done great on the cost savings year-to-date, and I wonder whether growth investments were ever put on hold or maybe pushed out. That target has gone up a couple times this year as end markets look slow. So are you reinitiating any growth investments? Or is this facility gain really funding new projects?","Frank S. Hermance","No, it's definitely funding new projects. So we stated at the -- I think at the beginning of the year that we were putting $35 million in growth investments, and we have not, in any way, tailored that $35 million as we made other cost improvements. Our cost improvements were more focused on the materials side, on consolidation of facilities, things of that nature, not the key growth initiatives in the company. So this extra $7 million that I talked about in response to Allison's question is truly incremental to that $35 million. So we are now saying we are going to invest $42 million in growth investments during full 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","One question for Bob and then 2 for you, Frank. Did the additional acquisition costs roll through the other line? Is that where we're seeing it?","Robert R. Mandos","Yes, Scott. That's where it rolled through. There was a piece that rolled through the other line, and there's also some that's above the line as well. But the majority of it flowed through the other line.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it. Frank, how was pricing in the quarter?","Frank S. Hermance","It was great. We're very pleased with pricing. It was up 1.8% in the quarter. And we look at a metric, as I think you're aware, Scott, of pricing minus total inflation in -- which includes salaries, materials, MRO activity, everything -- essentially everything. And that ratio of price minus cost was actually up about 0.8%. So in essence, that went to the bottom line. And obviously, there's other give-and-takes in terms of the growth investments, et cetera, but if you look at just the pricing minus inflation, that's the impact of it.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And is there any way to kind of parse out what pricing is? Is it kind of the same level in the order number?","Frank S. Hermance","I can't answer that off the top of my head. I would not expect any major difference, but I actually did not look at pricing in the orders that were coming in. We can -- usually, there isn't a major difference, but I really didn't look at it. We can get that information to you, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","But bottom line, is that with volumes apparently been down a little bit in the quarter, you're expecting that to reverse course in the fourth quarter?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, that's exactly right.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, could you just go through your typical 5-business unit sales, Frank?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, sure. Okay, we'll start with EIG. In Aerospace in EIG, the business really had an excellent quarter. Sales were up high single digits on a percentage basis, driven by continued strong performance in our commercial Aerospace business and from continued strength in our business and regional jet businesses. We remain really very well positioned to capitalize on the growing OEM build rates, increasing content on the next-generation aircraft and also the improving trends in the aerospace aftermarket. So for all of 2013, EIG Aerospace organic growth should be up mid-single digits. And as I mentioned, order growth in the quarter was up low double digits. So Aerospace looks solid going forward. Moving on to Process, our Process businesses also had a very strong quarter, with overall sales up mid-teens on a percentage basis, and organic sales were also strong, up mid-single digits. Organic growth in the quarter was driven by continued strength in oil and gas, which we have talked about for a number of quarters. And also, our Advanced Measurement Technology business had a strong solid quarter. Overall growth, well, obviously benefited from the Controls Southeast and Micro-Poise acquisitions. And for the full year, we expect our Process businesses to grow low double digits on a percentage basis, with overall organic growth up low single digits, maybe edging up to mid-single digits. Power and Industrial -- sales for Power and Industrial were down 10% on a percentage basis, on a difficult comparison to 2012. In 2012, we had a number of large Power and Industrial projects that went through the sales line, and therefore, this number is depressed based on that. And for all of 2013, we expect sales for Power and Industrial to be down mid-single digits. So if you sum those 3 parts of Aerospace for all -- or 3 parts of EIG, for all of EIG, we expect overall 2013 sales to be up mid-single digits, with organic growth up low single digits. And then, Scott, moving to the other part of the company, in EMG, the Differentiated businesses' overall sales were flat during the quarter from the prior year, we had solid growth in Precision Motion Control and third-party Aerospace MRO businesses, but it was offset by softness in our EMIP business. For all of 2013, we expect the Differentiated businesses to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, with approximately flat organic growth. And the last part of the company, Floorcare and Specialty Motors had a really great quarter. As I mentioned, their orders were up organically on -- about 20% basis, and overall sales were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the quarter. And this is driven by new program wins. It's not driven by an easy comparison, et cetera. It's really driven by new program wins. That team has done a superlative job in finding new business where not only we can grow the top line but also grow the bottom line. And for all of 2013, we expect sales for this business to be up mid-single digits. So if you sum those 2 parts of EMG for all of AMETEK, we're expecting mid-single-digit sales growth, with organic growth up just low single digits. But as I mentioned, the fourth quarter, we expect to be really good with overall sales up high single digits and organic growth up that mid-single-digit level. So, Scott, that's the company.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Frank, can you talk about the really strong orders in Aerospace? How does that breakdown as far as when you expect to deliver, is it a mix of some short-cycle, maybe, MRO, as well as longer-cycle, longer-term projects you're going to deliver in 2014?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, it's a combination of both, Mark. Orders were particularly strong in the business. In regional jet business, they were up mid-teens, actually, and most of that business is on the EIG side. Those shipments tend to be quicker than commercial aerospace. And the commercial aerospace orders were also strong, but that tends to be longer term. To your point, moving over to the EMG side of the business, we had good order growth in our third-party MRO business, and that tends to be, obviously, much shorter term. So it's a pretty good outlook for Aerospace, both on the short term and the long term. If you look at the backlogs at Boeing and Airbus, they're very, very strong. Boeing just had a great quarter. They're shipping at higher levels. They're -- this year, overall, Boeing is going to be up about 7% in OEM shipments, Airbus is going to be up about 5%, so roughly 6% in commercial aerospace looking at those 2 major providers. Business in regional jets, the market isn't as strong, but as I've mentioned on previous calls, we've won some major business, in particular with Gulfstream. So that, both in orders and in shipments, this is one of our highest growth areas right now. So we're really outpacing the market there. And the trends in third-party MRO seem to be on the improving side, so it's a really good outlook for Aerospace.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","And when you mix all that together, is there going to be a -- there's probably going to be a significant shift in margins in the Aerospace? I assume your MRO is more profitable than the OEMs, but if they're both growing, do you think the mix is going to be relatively stable?","Frank S. Hermance","Well, it depends on what part of the MRO business we're talking about. I was actually referring to the third-party MRO business that we have. And actually, our OEM margins are higher than the third-party MRO margins by a bit. If you look at our aftermarket business, in other words, products that we sell to the aftermarket that we also have the OEM business on, then you're right that, in essence, there is going to be a margin improvement. So I would expect, as we look forward, a bit of a market -- margin improvement but not as significant as your question suggests.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then finally, when you talk about strong oil and gas, can you go a little deeper. Just what products are particularly strong for you there, and are you talking more up-, mid-, downstream, what you're seeing in those markets?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. I think the best way that I could characterize it is that our upstream business is doing extremely well. It has done extremely well for an extended period of time. A major part of that business is outside the United States, about 70% is outside the United States, about 30% inside the United States, so we're enjoying the international growth aspects of the oil and gas business. Midstream is doing fine. It's not growing at the same rate, but it's doing fine. And then the downstream part of the business, which has lagged, is starting to show some life. So overall, when you look at the 3 segments, it's a very good picture, but it's clearly being driven by the upstream portion.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then finally, Bob, what were payables?","Robert R. Mandos","$331 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On Creaform, can you talk about the multiple on the deal and sort of what you're seeing out there in terms of multiples in general? You talked about a pickup in activity, it seems like.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, Jamie, we paid approximately 10x EBITDA for this business, and that is a bit higher than we normally pay. But as I've already mentioned, this is a very high growth kind of business. So taking that into account, it's sort of a normal type of deal for AMETEK. In terms of your more general question, deal multiples have gone up a bit. They basically -- if I had to average it, they're probably up about 1 point from where they were 1 or 2 years ago. And what we're doing is parsing the deals that we're looking at, either to where we have more than the norm of synergies or more than the norm of organic growth. And with Creaform, it was clearly a growth picture. For CSI, the other deal we announced this year, it was more of a cost type of picture with high synergy. So that's the way we're viewing it, and thus, we're getting a very good internal rate of return on these businesses, good ROIC in year 3 and some accretion out of these businesses as well.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So does it seem a little bit tougher to get deals closer to the finish line, given the filter is a little bit more fine now from what you're looking at, given the multiples?","Frank S. Hermance","I would say maybe a little bit, but the other side of that is, our team, and as I think you may be aware, we have about 10 people throughout the company who are spending 100% of their time on deals and a large number of other people who are spending part time on deals. So many of our deals are coming from our internal efforts and tend to be more proprietary. And on those deals, I'd say there hasn't been any significant change. So there might be a slight impact, mainly due to the deals that come in from the investment banking community, but I'm pretty bullish right now on deals. We're as busy as we have ever been. So hopefully, we can close the deals that we have in the hopper. And if we can, we're not only going to have a very good year this year, we're also going to go in to next year with some sizable upward thrust due to those deals.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And maybe, if you can, just talk through the geographic organic growth you sort of saw around the world and, given the strong orders, if there is any notable trends by geography as well.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, I can give you the organic growth in sales. Basically, when we look around the world, the weakest part for us was actually the U.S., it was down about 4%. Asia was roughly flat. And Europe, surprisingly, I guess, was up about 4%. So when you average those, you'll get to that plus 1% organic growth for the company. And if you look at the detail underneath those numbers, I would say both the U.S. and Asia were just due to this somewhat lethargic return that we're seeing in the general economy. Our strength in Europe was driven by both our Aerospace and our Process businesses, where in our Process businesses, oil and gas, as we just recently talked about, is -- was very strong. And our Aerospace businesses are doing very well in Europe. So that's sort of the picture around the globe. When I step back and look at the whole sort of demand environment, I characterize it as a slowly improving demand environment. No question, it feels better today than it did 3 months ago, but somebody mentioned to me recently, \"Oh, you're seeing a major uptick.\" And I would say, \"That is not the case. It is not a major uptick, it is a slowly improving demand environment.\" The follow-up on your question of orders, we were actually pretty strong -- stronger in all of the regions, so orders were encouraging, and things are, in fact, picking up a bit. I don't have the numbers in my head for each area, but I do know that each geographic area was good on orders.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Frank, just 2 questions, maybe some follow-ups here on the Aerospace side. How did the military aerospace piece hold up, not just in the quarters but orders?","Frank S. Hermance","Okay. Military was strong. It was strong. It was low single digits. I'm saying that's strong in terms of organic growth because we had been running down a few points. So this quarter, we were actually up a few points on sales. And orders were roughly in that same magnitude. Actually, I think orders were a little bit better. Kevin is actually looking it up. Do you have it there, Kevin?","Kevin C. Coleman","It's here, yes.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So, okay, kind of a mid-single-digit level?","Frank S. Hermance","It was high single on orders.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That seems to be a pretty positive surprise for you...","Frank S. Hermance","Yes.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","As you head into the back part of this year.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Do you think that's -- as just a quick thought on '14 on the military aerospace side, is it just -- is flat a good assumption or should we be more cautious than that?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, I think, with what I know right now, and we're just going into the budget season and one of the first businesses, actually, is our military business that we're going to take a look at. So barring the fact that I don't know exactly what they're going to say in that budget meeting, my gut is flat is a good assumption. Clearly, this business is not going to be down 5% or 10%, which was our fear maybe a year ago. But right now, I would say, flat is a reasonable assumption, and I'll update you in the call at the end of the first quarter as to exactly how we're feeling about the year.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Sure. And then in terms of Europe, again, I'm curious, Aerospace has been strong in Europe for the year. And is the obvious conclusion there that our Airbus exposure is kind of driving that strength?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, there's -- there are 2 parts to that. There's definitely our Airbus exposure, which has been very, very helpful. And now with winning new business on all of the major Airbus platforms, it's going to be very positive for AMETEK because we're going to be sort of agnostic as to whether Boeing is winning in the end market or Airbus is winning in the end market. In addition, though, our third-party MRO business there is doing very, very well. We've got a strong management team there. They have been winning share in that part of the world. And as a result, it's really the combination of those 2 things that is driving the strong European performance.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question. At EMG, we touched on the margins there, the 19.9% margins. And again, I understand the mix of business today kind of maybe pressuring the margins a little bit. But what seems interesting here is that, with these new wins and the volume gains on the Floorcare side, I presume when the Differentiated businesses recover, that the margin potential of this segment will be higher.","Frank S. Hermance","No question, Richard. When we step back and look at the margin profile of the company, the differential in group margins is significant between EIG and EMG, and the potential is definitely in EMG. On the longer term, there's absolutely no reason that we can't raise the EMG margins to start approaching the EIG margins. And just the natural migration in EMG, where we're going to do deals and where we're going to put the majority of the investment is going to be on the Differentiated side. So as that Differentiated side of EMG first comes back, and then as we increase their volumes through acquisitions and organic growth investments, the margins on EMG are going to work in our favor. So in a way, this was a bit on an abnormal quarter, where the Floorcare and Specialty Motors part of the business just performed so well that it did have a bit of a slight deterioration on the margin impact in that business.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","But is the cost-driven Motors business, with these new wins and the volume that they bring and, obviously, a new market niche, I would think, if you just segment out the cost-driven Motors business, that the margins 1 year or 2 from now are going to be better than cost-driven margins were a couple years ago?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. I don't think there's any question about that. That, that is, in fact, a true statement that those numbers are going to improve because, there's no question, the margins on the new wins is much better than the base business. However, they are still not going to be at the level of the Differentiated businesses.","Operator","And the next question comes from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Frank, this is actually Joe Radigan on for Matt. In Process, are you still seeing orders drift to the right for the mid- and higher-end instrumentation that you sell? I'm assuming the funding environment there is still pretty challenging. And then maybe a second part to that, do you typically benefit from a year-end budget flush? Or what sort of visibility do you -- are you getting from your customers?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, that's a good question. I would say there is still a bit of a shift to the right. I would say it is not as significant as what we saw at the end of the third quarter, but I still detect some cautiousness with our customers. At the year-end, there are some of our businesses that, in their weekly reports, are definitely talking about customers that normally would take shipments in the fourth quarter are just being hesitant and trying to shift some to the first quarter. So to me, it just lines up with this slowly improving demand environment, that everybody is a bit cautious, it feels a bit better now than it did a quarter ago, but this is not an all-out let's go for the gold here. It just isn't -- it isn't that kind of environment. And I haven't heard anything when it comes to, specifically, budgets, but I think it's all wrapped up in that equation of a slowly growing economic environment.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the EMIP business, have you anniversary-ed the destocking that's been a headwind there? It seems like you've been calling off -- calling out softness there for some time now. Just can you just update us kind of on the situation in that business?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. No, that's been a disappointment to us. In fact, the destocking impact on that business has dragged on a bit longer than we expected, and that was a bit of a drag on our performance in the third quarter, and -- but it's definitely getting better. And I think it is going to cycle out as we get to the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. Just was more of a buildup because the OEMs had, really, take-or-pay contracts with many of the titanium producers. And as a result, they were forced to take the products when they didn't need it. For instance, when the 787 was grounded for a period of time, obviously, there was some backup in the supply chain. But I think it's getting better. I think we're going to see much better performance out of this unit next year. And so it's really -- I'm viewing it as upside from this point on.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, on the incremental growth investments, you talked about service opportunities. Can you just give a little more color there? Is this greenfield stuff or is it expanding the footprint that you already have? Just a little more on the aftermarket service side.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. I know, it's a great question. In general, this is service in areas where we are presently selling products and where service is particularly important to the customers. And that tends to be in Southeast Asia, China, that part of the world. And you can imagine, you put a high-end analytic instrument into a factory in the middle of China, and if it fails and they can't get a replacement product, they're going to have a problem with their output. And so what we are doing is putting more sales and service people in those geographic regions, a little bit in the U.S. but predominantly outside the U.S. And what that does is when something fails, they call our service people. We're there. We're there within a few hours or 24 hours, and we can get their plans back up. And that is highly valued. And it isn't just the fact that we get the revenue on that sales call, which is high, and the margins are good, it's very important for the next level of sales from those customers. There's going to be a strong bias to buy the products from people who have those service capabilities. So that's why we're putting that investment in. It's almost, from an economic return viewpoint, a no-brainer. It's just you can put the people in, they pay for themselves in a very short period of time, and it essentially helps the organic growth of the business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Andy Noorigian with Vertical Research.","Andrew Noorigian - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Frank, I was wondering if you could touch on the Power and Industrial business a little bit more. Have you seen any signs in the heavy truck and off-road of inflection in orders or just underlying improvement in demand trends there?","Frank S. Hermance","Maybe a little bit of an upturn. And if you look at the market data in the North American market, which is the primary market that we serve, in 2013, the forecasts are about 244,000, if I remember the number correctly, in truck sales. But that's down about 9% to 11% over 2012. The market forecast for 2014 is actually up, it's up about 16%. Now that number does tend to fluctuate, but it does suggest market improvement next year. And I would say we're starting to see some of that right now.","Andrew Noorigian - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Great. And then on the U.S., down 4%, I was wondering if anything in particular stood out that drove that. And has some of that softness continued into October?","Frank S. Hermance","I would say there was really no specific area in the company that I could point to. It was just general slowness in the U.S. So there was -- nothing that I can point to that says that's it, that that's the reason for that. And your second question was?","Andrew Noorigian - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just how that's trended into October from the management perspective.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes. I can't answer that question because I look at overall orders. I haven't looked at U.S. orders in particular. I mean, we're only a few weeks in, but, again, Kevin could get that data for you.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time. Mr. Coleman, I'll turn the conference back to you.

I'll now turn the call over to Dave.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. The AMETEK business model continues to deliver exceptional results, with another outstanding high-quality quarter. We generated a record level of sales, with both strong organic sales growth and solid contributions from our recent acquisitions. We delivered excellent operating performance which drove a record level of diluted earnings per share and we generated significant level of operating cash flow with impressive free cash flow conversion, which speaks of the high-quality nature of AMETEK's performance. As a result, we are again raising our full-year 2017 guidance across all key metrics.","Now, on to the financial and business highlights for the quarter. AMETEK's sales in the third quarter were a record $1.08 billion, up 15% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Organic sales were up 7%. Acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency was a one-point benefit. We are very encouraged by the continued strong level of organic sales growth. It remains broad based and reflects the strength of our underlying niche businesses.","In addition to the strong sales growth, we continued to see excellent growth in orders. Overall orders were up 16% in the quarter, while organic orders were up 9%. This level of organic growth drove our record backlog at nearly $1.4 billion.","Operating income in the quarter was $232.8 million, up 16% from the same quarter of 2016. Operating income margins were 21.5%, up 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. Excluding the dilutive impact on margins of recent acquisitions, operating income margins in the quarter were 22%, up 70 basis points versus the same period in 2016. Third quarter diluted earnings per share were a record $0.66, an 18% increase compared to last year's third quarter of $0.56. Our businesses continued to operate extremely efficiently, leading to strong cash flow generation. Operating cash flow in the quarter was excellent at $239 million, up 41% over the prior year.","Now, turning to the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG sales in the third quarter were a record $671.6 million, up 16% versus the third quarter of 2016. Organic sales were up 5%, with the acquisition of Rauland and MOCON contributing 11% increase in sales. Foreign currency was a small tailwind in the quarter. EIG's operating income in the third quarter increased to $164.4 million, up 15% over the prior year and operating income margins were strong at 24.5%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions on margins, EIG margins were 25.6%, up 100 basis points over the prior year.","The Electromechanical Group had a great quarter with broad-based sales growth and excellent operating performance. EMG third quarter sales were $413.2 million, up 13% year-over-year. Organic sales were very strong, up 11%, with the acquisition of Laserage contributing two points and foreign currency was a one-point benefit. EMG's third quarter operating income was $84.1 million, an increase of 18% versus the third quarter of 2016. Operating margins were excellent at 20.3%, up 80 basis points compared to the same period last year.","In summary, the growth in performance across all of the AMETEK, both in the third quarter and over the first nine months of the year, has been excellent, with double-digit growth in sales and earnings through the first nine months of 2017.","Now, before I discuss our updated outlook for the year, let me touch on some exciting recent events that highlight some of the success of our growth strategies. First, we're very pleased with the performance and integration of our recent acquisitions. With the acquisitions of Rauland and MOCON thus far in 2017, we have deployed approximately $520 million in capital and acquired approximately $225 million in sales.","Related to these two acquisitions, MOCON, a leading provider of laboratory and field gas analysis instrumentation, recently launched a new system to measure the water vapor transition rate of ultra-high barrier materials. This new product will help MOCON expand into several new high-growth market adjacencies. The AQUATRAN Model 3 will out push the performance of highly engineered materials, such as flexible films and organic LED displays used in high-end televisions and electronics and photovoltaics for solar panels, which can be affected by moisture damage. The AQUATRAN system measures each molecule of water that passes through the sensor, providing highly sensitive, accurate, and repeatable results.","Also, during the third quarter, Rauland, a leader in the design and delivery of critical communication solutions for hospitals and nursing care facilities, launched an exciting new product, the Responder 5000. This new solution was developed to assist nursing care facilities in providing the residents with a high quality of care by providing economic and effective workflow and communication solutions. As a result, the Responder 5000 can help nursing care facilities ensure compliance with Medicare value-based purchasing programs, leading to higher levels of reimbursement. So, the solution has also been customized for use in hospitals internationally, with efficient workflow and communication solutions for those markets.","We are very pleased with the performance of these recent acquisitions and are very excited with the growth potential, given their attractive stream of new product offerings and their global and new market expansion opportunities: two pillars of AMETEK's four growth strategies.","In addition to these new products from Rauland and MOCON, all our businesses continued to develop differentiated products and solutions to solve our customers' most challenging problems. The success of this work can be seen through our organic sales and orders growth, and also on our vitality index, which measures the share of sales coming from new products and solutions introduced within the last three years.","In the quarter, our vitality index was very strong at 24%, reflecting excellent engineering and new product development capability, combined with our commitment to investing appropriately in innovation. In 2017, we expect to increase our investment in RD&E to approximately $220 million, which is roughly 5% of sales, and up 10% over 2016.","Along with these new acquisitions and new products, our businesses continued to strengthen through our operational excellence initiatives. As we have highlighted throughout the year, we are rolling out several very exciting operational excellence initiatives focused on enhancing the organic growth opportunity across our businesses. Our teams are engaged and we are excited with the early results we have seen from these efforts.","We also continue to drive impressive results in productivity improvements and cost reductions, as we continue to expect approximately $100 million in total operational excellence savings for all of 2017. Along with these savings, we continue to deliver excellent working capital management, leading to outstanding cash flow generation, which Bill will discuss further in a moment.","One final bit of exciting news I would like to share involves AMETEK's Zygo business and their important contributions to the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to three scientists for their work in the observation of gravitational waves. Zygo, a supplier of optical metrology instruments, high precision optical components and complex electro-optical systems, manufactured critical components for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. The observatory successfully detected gravitational waves for the first time, and as a result, proved one of Albert Einstein's key elements in his general theory of relativity. This achievement speaks to the high quality and highly technical nature of our businesses and products and the positive impact they are making.","We remain focused on strengthening our leadership in differentiated products and in continuing to develop important solutions for our research and science customers throughout the world. I would like to congratulate Zygo for their contributions to this important project. With that, let me finish with our updated outlook for the year.","For all of 2017, we now expect overall sales to increase by low-double digits on a percentage basis compared to 2016. Organic sales are now expected to increase mid-single digits on a percentage basis over the prior year. Once again, we have increased our earnings guidance range for 2017. We now expect earnings to be $2.57 to $2.58 per diluted share, up 12% over 2016's adjusted diluted earnings per share. This is an increase from our prior guidance range of $2.46 to $2.52.","For the fourth quarter of 2017, we are anticipating overall sales to be up low-double digits on a percentage basis, with organic sales up mid-single digits. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share are expected to be $0.66 to $0.67, an increase of 14% to 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 adjusted earnings.","To summarize, AMETEK delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter and we are well positioned for a strong finish to 2017. Our world-class teams are operating their businesses very well, which is producing high-quality earnings growth and providing a solid foundation for future success through our four growth strategies.","I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter and the year. Then, we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. As Dave mentioned, our businesses continue to perform very well, generating record results during the third quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights.","In the third quarter, core selling expenses were up in line with core sales growth. General and administrative expense in the third quarter were up $2.7 million over the prior year, due largely to higher compensation expense. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.9%, in line with last year's third quarter rate of 25%.","For 2017, we now expect our tax rate to be between 26% and 26.5%. As we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full-year rate. Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was excellent at 17.9% of sales in the third quarter, down from 20.8% in the same period of 2016.","Capital expenditures were $18 million for the quarter, and $46 million through the first nine months of 2017. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $45 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $180 million.","Our businesses continue to generate excellent cash flow. Third quarter operating cash flow was $239 million, a 41% increase compared to the third quarter of 2016. Free cash flow in the quarter was $221 million, an outstanding 144% of net income. For the full year, excluding the $50 million pension contribution we made in the first quarter, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 125% of net income. Our primary use of this strong cash generation is to support strategic acquisitions. As Dave mentioned, we've been very active on this front in 2017, deploying approximately $520 million on the acquisitions of Rauland and MOCON.","Total debt at September 30 was $2.43 billion, up from $2.34 billion at the end of 2016. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $736 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 31%. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.8 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.","To summarize, the performance from our businesses during the quarter was outstanding and provided high quality of earnings. We look forward to closing out a strong year, and remain well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow.","Kevin?","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Bill. Andrew, we'd like to open the line for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. Great quarter.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Now, I will ask a question. If I look at your operating leverage back in sort of 2012, 2013, 2014 period, it does seem it was a tad higher versus what we're getting right now. Can you just talk about specific challenges of coming out this prolonged downturn and just how much costs you need to add and whether we can get back to the old operating leverage or this is the kind of level we should be thinking as new normal? Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure, Andrew. We think we had a great quarter margin wise. We were 21.5%, up 20 basis points. But excluding acquisitions, as I said in the prepared remarks, they were actually 22%, up 70 basis points. And if you go to the group lines, the EIG and EMG, ex acquisitions, were actually up 100 basis points in each group. And we saw incrementals, core incrementals in Q3 were up 39% on the incremental volume. So, we're very pleased with the results and we believe it's a good thing for our shareholders when AMETEK acquires lower-margin businesses.","And what you're seeing is the Rauland and MOCON, when we acquired them, they were low to mid-teens EBITDA businesses. And AMETEK is obviously much more profitable. So, we improve the margins of those businesses substantially and they may be dilutive to margins for the short-term. But, ends up driving tremendous value creation in the long run and excellent returns on capital. So, we're very pleased with the performance of the strategy and we think it's endorsed with what we're trying to do with the business.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","39%, nothing to sneeze at. Another question, can you just talk about, Dave, since you've taken over, what are the changes that you're implementing? We're sort of hearing about sort of a more structured approach to internal business systems. What can you share about what's happening inside AMETEK, culture wise?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Andrew, I've been with the company for 27 years and I was part of the culture of the past and part of the culture going forward, and really, the culture hasn't changed. I mean, the two areas that we've talked about, we've definitely put a larger emphasis on our organic growth and we have a structured approach to that, and we made it part of our operational excellence program and we're really getting traction with that organic growth, and the tools that we're adding to our toolkit to help our businesses understand the opportunity.","And then, the second issue is related to the size and scale of the business. We want to double the earnings of the company over the next five years. So, we increased our acquisition pipeline of businesses a little bit larger, $200 million to $400 million in revenue. Prior to that time, they weren't in the pipeline of deals. So, they're working through the deal pipeline and we're looking at those bigger deals and we think we can add the same kind of value to them. But, it's the same company. The strategy is flexible enough to tweak it when it's needed. But, we feel really confident we're on the right track and headed in the right direction for the next five years.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thank you so much.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Dave, Bill, Kevin. How are you?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I was wondering if you wouldn't go through your typical by-business...","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","Sub-segment sure (19:56).","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. But even, if I may, before that, could you talk about the orders as the quarter progressed? And obviously, I'm not talking about dollars because of seasonality, but on a year-over-year percentage change basis. Because your second half of last year starts to show some more stability in orders. And just kind of wondering what that looked like as each month passed? And now with October done, if you can maybe comment there, as well?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Our orders for the quarter organically were up 9%. So, we had a very strong quarter in orders and it was broad based across end markets and geographies, and it followed a typical pattern. So, we started the quarter a little bit lower and we finished really strongly. So, the orders strengthened through the quarter. And that answers that question.","I'll get into the sub-segments. Go across around the sub-segments of AMETEK. I'll start with our overall Aerospace business. Sales for overall Aerospace were up low-single digits in the quarter. Similar to last year, we saw strong growth across \u2013 similar to last quarter, we saw strong growth across our military business. Our military business has really picked up.","We also saw solid growth across our business and regional jet business due to a ramp up in shipments and support of new program wins. And for all of 2017, we continue to expect our Aerospace business to be up low to mid-single digits with growth expected across each of our market segments.","In addition to the solid growth this year, the Aerospace business is a long-term business and you have to win new programs. And our Aerospace teams continue to have excellent success in delivering new long-term program wins across a wide range of platforms. Year-to-date, our teams have already secured over $300 million in life of program awards across a range of commercial, business jet, and military platforms.","Next, I'll talk about process. Our process business has had an excellent third quarter, with overall sales up 20%, driven by contributions from the acquisitions of Rauland and MOCON and by strong mid-single digit organic growth. The organic sales growth was broad based across our process businesses. And we saw excellent growth across our ultra-precision technologies, our UPT business, especially in our Zygo and our TMC, Precitech business units. And given the quarter's solid performance, we now expect organic sales for the process businesses to be up mid-single digits for the year. Well, we've increased that a bit.","Our power and industrial business performed very well in the third quarter with solid mid-single-digit organic sales growth. We saw solid growth from each power and industrial segment, particular strength was across our power, test and measurement segment. And we continue to expect organic sales for power and industrial to be up low to mid-single digits for the full year.","Our differentiated EMG businesses continued to perform very well, with another quarter of excellent growth as end demand remains solid across our key markets. In the third quarter, organic sales for our differentiated EMG businesses were up low-double digits, with particularly strong growth in our EMIP and Precision Motion Control businesses. Within our Precision Motion Control businesses, we're continuing to see very strong growth within our Dunkermotoren business, as it is benefiting from strong conditions across its key automation markets.","So, for all of 2017, we now expect organic sales for all differentiated EMG to be at mid to high-single digits versus 2016. And finally, for Floorcare & Specialty Motors, our smallest segment, organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were up low-single digits in the third quarter, as this business continues to see solid demand across its key elements and across its key markets and key customers. And for 2017, we continue to expect organic sales for this business to be up mid-single digits.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That'll do it. Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning, all.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just want to come back to the growth initiatives. Obviously, a lot of traction there on the channel development and some of the measures you're taking internally. I guess, if you were to look at the order rate of 9% in the quarter, are you able to identify or unbundle that rate between what's being driven by the market and what share gain and some of the opportunities that you think you're winning based on some of these initiatives?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yes, we are definitely seeing broad based improvement across our end markets and we're also seeing improved geographical strength throughout the world. But, with 7% organic growth, we're clearly win share also, both in Q3 and as you see in the first nine months of the year. And we're certainly seeing tangible success from some of the organic growth initiatives that you mentioned, and we also continue to see great success from our new product development efforts driving market share gains. But it's very difficult to dissect those in our niche businesses.","And so, we're definitely growing share, and if I point you to some businesses where I saw excellent performance, is our PMC business. The automation market is about 10% of sales for AMETEK. And participation in this market is the result of some acquisitions that we based around our core motor technology, and it's resulted in the acquisitions of Dunkermotoren and Haydon Kerk. And really those businesses, working in unison, have perfected the art of delivering custom automation subassemblies to customers and they're seeing tremendous growth and the growing share in a good market.","We're also growing share in our Ultra Precision Technologies business. But in general, across the board, we're motivated, we're winning share, and we're also benefiting from improvements in end markets and improvements in geographies, and it's very difficult to break those out.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood. And then, just back to EIG operating margins, obviously some dilutive pressure from the two deals in 2017. But, I guess, as you normalize, or you think about the construct into 2018, what was the headwind this year? How much more runway do you have over the next 12 months to improve the operational performance in those businesses? And I guess, I'm trying to get at, what's sort of a good placeholder for EIG margins into 2018 as these integrations kind of run their course?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. I understand the question. As we always do, we'll provide our guidance for 2018 when we release our fourth quarter earnings in late January. And our businesses in both EIG and EMG are going through their detailed budget work, and we'll be meeting with each business this month to review those plans for next year. So, I'm really not in a position to comment on our expectations for 2018. But I will say that we've stated externally that we think there's margin expansion opportunities for the company. And the number that we've used, as far as the eye can see is 30 basis points to 40 basis points.","And we get to that number by taking the high contribution margins of our business, of 40-plus percent, 35% contribution margins and adding to that our pricing power, and adding to that our tremendous operating capability. So, as we sit here and we look out long term, we'll certainly be expanding margins, but I don't want to comment specifically on a group or a business because we haven't done the work yet.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then, just one follow-up. You said 39% core incrementals. Presumably, most of the pressure, sort of one-time pressure would be in EIG. Electromechanical incrementals were kind of 27%. So, implicitly, much higher in EIG on a core basis. What were they, on a core basis, if you remove some of the deal noise in EIG?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, it was over 50% on a core basis. I think it was 57%. So, you're right on that.","Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Thank you. Just a quick one in terms of where you were in the quarter on pricing versus raw material input costs, and whether or not you have any sort of concern over inflationary pressures heading into 2018, perhaps more so than you were heading into 2017?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure, Matt. Pricing actually improved in Q3 versus the first half of the year for us. So, we achieved 1.3% across our entire portfolio, and total inflation was about 1%. And it was very balanced across our portfolio, with similar results in all our different businesses. So, we are very pleased with that. And as you know, some other industrial companies have not been able to offset inflationary costs with increased pricing. So we were concerned with this trend and made sure all our business leaders were aware of it, and we're very pleased with the results. The results speak to the differentiated aspect and nature of AMETEK's product portfolio and our leadership position in the niche markets that we're in.","And, as I said before in the prior quarter, what you see generally in 2016, the customers will migrate to \u2013 we have a good, better, best pricing marketing philosophy within the AMETEK portfolio. So, often, when times are tough and customers don't have a lot of capital to spend, they'll buy our good products. And as the markets tend to improve, customers will buy a fully-featured product, that are maybe the best. And we'll see pricing expand with that. So, we are pleased to see 1.3 points of price in the quarter and we feel good for fourth quarter that kind of performance will be able to continue.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","And then, just a follow-up on backlog. You continued, I believe so, at least, continued to build backlog throughout the year. What has been the key sort of either business or end market contributors to that build? And do you expect further expansion in Q4? Thank you.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Our backlog was a record at $1.4 billion and it was broad based. I mean, we had positive book-to-bill in EIG and EMG. So, as we had said in prior quarters, with some of our longer-cycle businesses, they're not going to necessarily ship in the next quarter or the current quarter. They're going to be out there in the backlog. So, that's what you see happening. You see our longer cycle businesses strengthening.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. Thanks, David.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hey, just wanted to \u2013 you talked about areas where you're gaining share. Just wanted to see if you could draw a distinction between gaining share or actually creating market size with some of your applications.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, creating markets is something that we're doing with some of our technologies, like our \u2013 in our Materials Analysis business. And we're doing adjacency work there and adjacency work on our UPT business. And those adjacency works were often taking core technologies and combining it with other technologies into new markets and creating some markets. Our atom probe for our Materials Analysis division will be that kind of business, where there's really no competition, because we've got the only person that manufactures atom probes. And so, we're creating a market there. And creating a market could take time, and there's a lot of missionary work done on the expenses. We're doing some missionary work like that with our Creaform business, also, with our \u2013 and our UPT business with some of the 3D metrology. So, that's happening. But, what you really see is, in general, good markets and share gains adding to 7% organic growth.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. And just in terms of the M&A pipeline, I think some areas like metrology and power quality, you've done a fair amount of consolidation already. What platforms you're currently seeing as particularly attractive in terms of the fragmentation out there and ripeness for you to step up the consolidation?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Right. Well, we have a dedicated team of about 10 M&A professionals who work closely with our businesses to identify strategic acquisitions and we have each of our business units develops an acquisition strategy. So, we have a lot of people working on a lot of things across a broad set of opportunities which we can identify, find good fits for AMETEK and remain disciplined in our return metrics. So, we need a big pipeline. We've got a lot of people working on it and we're searching for deals in a lot of areas.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. You've actually got Sawyer Rice on here for Nigel. Maybe just, firs, a high level question on EPS reporting. We've seen some news from other companies around the industry, on shifting to a cash EPS or an EPS that excludes the amortization. Just wanted to know if you guys have had any \u2013 if that's something you guys have looked at or any thoughts on that metric there.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. Being an acquisitive company, we certainly would have a benefit if we excluded the amortization. But we reported \u2013 we're a GAAP company and at this time, we decided to not to do that at this point. We've been talking to our investor base about it. Even within the same shops, there's a bit of an argument within our investor base if we do it or not, so we're listening to it. And we certainly don't want to put ourselves at a disadvantage, but we report GAAP numbers and we haven't made a decision to do cash EPS reporting. We've reported the amortization, so it's out there and it can be calculated and figured out. But, we have no plans to do it at this time. That's probably the best way to state it.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then, maybe just one more, if I could squeeze it in here. On the EMIP backlog, just any color on the visibility you have in that business? And then, again, maybe some color on how we should think about orders phasing through 4Q and into 2018, in terms of conversion and sales. Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. In Q3, our EMIP business showed a continuing positive sequential trend. Sales were strong. Orders were also strong in the quarter, a bit better than the EMG average for organic sales. And for the year, for EMG \u2013 for EMIP, we're projecting mid to high-single-digit organic growth in line with the EMG average. So, very pleased with what's happening in that business. Very pleased with the sequential growth and it feels like our customers are back to normal and we're executing well.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Congratulations, guys, on a strong quarter.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you, Robert.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess, dovetailing some of the other questions that have come on about margins, maybe you could give us a state of play for your end markets around specialty metals and oil and gas, and obviously it relates to certain divisions as well. But, how has been the incremental margin performance there? Has it been in line? Because, I think the previous expectation, sort of (36:46) was probably in the 40% to 50% range? Have we been seeing it there? Was it a major incremental driver for your incremental margin strength at EMG? And then, how do we think about in the context of these end markets whether we've already seen the bolus of kind of the rebound or is that more on the common fourth quarter and going into 2018?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we're continuing to see our orders strong and there was broad-based improvement. So, orders were ahead of sales in a lot of our markets and a lot of our regions, so we're bullish about that. And our incremental margins were 39%. And with the contribution of the margin to the business is about 40%. So we think we're performing at a very strong level. And with the pricing power added to that, that's how we ended up with the EIG and EMG core margins at the group line, up 100 basis points. So, we're really pleased with \u2013 when you get under the hood, the margins are doing great and we look at it, even in the financial statements, with the acquisitions are doing very great. So, we're very pleased with our margin performance and we're very pleased with some of the pricing power we saw in the quarter.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess \u2013 but the spirit of the question is maybe drilling into the specific end markets around oil and gas and specialty metals to see what was the relative mix in those areas and whether that mix is going to be on the come, have we seen it? Kind of, what's the timing of that kind of incremental strong mix?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, the one point with metals, there is a dynamic there with metals inflation. So, as metals inflation increases, we pass that through to our customers. So, when you look at the EMG organic sales rate of 11%, about a point of that was from metals inflation. So, if you want incremental or contribution margin, it will be on a lower sales number. So, that may be what you're asking a question about.","And in terms of EIG, we're really seeing, in the oil and gas business, the upstream market is coming back very strong. We're seeing high-single-digit growth in the upstream and low-single-digit growth in the downstream. And we're also differentiated in niches, we didn't really give up much price in the downturn. So, we've got really strong pricing in oil and gas, and those markets are improving and it's a high contribution margin business and we're optimistic about the future.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Well, it sounds, from Brett Linzie's comments \u2013 questioning, obviously, the EIG margins were kind of in the high-50s on a core basis. And then, EMG was kind of in the high-20s. So, that speaks to that dynamic you're talking about. So, I think that's an important nuance. The other thing ...","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","So, to be specific, EIG was 57% core incremental and EMG was 33%.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Math has never been my strong suit. And then, finally, just on size decile, is there \u2013 do you think there's a strategic imperative here for the company, just given how long it takes to do a deal, the fixed cost and association with specing deals \u2013 getting done deals over the goal line, et cetera, et cetera. Could we see larger deals here given your fire power? How should we think about kind of the odds that your pipeline is maybe more shaped towards something larger?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Well, bigger deals are working in the pipeline. And you may see us announce a bigger deal every couple of years. But clearly, the core acquisition, the thing that AMETEK is really good at, is buying businesses in that $50 million to $150 million range, and that is the predominant acquisitions that you're going to see from us going forward. Our M&A team is setup to process four to six deals of these simultaneously, and we're out looking at a lot of things. Our pipeline remains active. Our pipeline is very active. We're busy, and we're excited about the quality and the breadth of our pipeline.","And you can't ever predict when something's going to transact in the short term, but we don't feel any need to stretch and do a bigger deal. We think there's plenty of opportunities in typical size deals, but at the same time, we're starting to look at slightly larger deals. They are by no means mergers of equals or anything like that. These are $200 million to $300 million revenue businesses, but we think we can add a lot of value. But, I would say that the predominant acquisition will be those $100 million deals that we create a lot of value with going forward.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys, good morning.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Good morning, Allison.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Dave, could you talk about R&D, 5% of sales today? Any changes to where you're eyeing that R&D? Obviously, there's some more technical aspects of your portfolio. And I guess, is that an appropriate amount, or should we be increasing it going forward? Any thoughts there?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I think the 5% is appropriate. And we've been very consistent over a long period of time, and the R&D was increased about 10% this year. So, healthy increase and we think we're getting a great return on that. And as you know, the way we manage that, our individual business units put together an R&D plan, those individual businesses will present their plans during their budgets and during their strat plans, and we'll critique them. But they're driving where they're spending their R&D.","Certainly, with the higher technology nature and with the larger size of EIG, we spend a bit more on EIG than EMG, but we've been a consistent spender over the long-term and we're really happy with what's happening. We have up-to-date fresh products and we're winning share. So, we're very pleased with our R&D efforts.","And I can just also add that over the past few years, we've added a tremendous capability in India. We have about 110 engineers over there that are augmenting our product development capability. And in our niche markets, we have some of the rock stars of the industry, in terms of our engineering capability with people that really know the products and the applications and take the technology forward. So, we have a great niche business of great technologies and we think we're spending appropriately.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And then, just going back to the M&A pipeline, you talked about it being active, as the industrial economy recovers. Has there been any, I guess, push-back, changes to multiples? Any different color that you've been seeing there?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, sure. I mean, the current environment, it's very similar to what we've been experiencing recently. And pricing is elevated, there's no doubt about that. There's plenty of cash chasing deals.","Despite this, we've been successful in deploying our free cash flow on acquisitions that will enhance the value of the company. So, we are really parsing a very robust pipeline to find the deals where we can remain disciplined in our return metrics. And we'll select the deals and we'll do the deals that \u2013 and we're focused on return on capital when we do a deal. So, we have $1.8 billion of fire power and really optimistic with what I see in the pipeline.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","David A.

So, given the multiples are fairly high, are you guys making any considerations for portfolio pruning actions?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","We ended our strategic planning process in the first half of the year, and we're very comfortable with our portfolio at this time. Our strategy is to focus on a broad, diverse set of niche markets, and we look to grow organically and through acquisitions in these niches. We don't want to become overexposed to any single market or any single customer. And we've weathered a bit of a downturn over the past couple of years, and all of our businesses have a bright future looking out the next two or three years. So, right now, that's our position.

Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah, I see \u2013 with EMIP, we're seeing in 2016, there was a financial problem in the metals market and we were really well positioned with niche products. And we told you at that time that the end markets were good, but the metals market in between us and our end customers were poor. So, what you really saw was that market in some distress. And what you really see now with the year, mid to high-single digit growth with our EMIP business is really a reflection of that improvement. So, we think we're at a level now that we're performing very well at and we're very pleased with the EMIP.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","It probably wouldn't be insane to think that that could even accelerate further as the build rates go higher, is that fair?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","I'm not going to comment on 2018, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Fair enough. Maybe you can comment a little bit on how the front end of your business looks today versus maybe how it looked a year or two ago. I mean, I know you, guys, with an engineering background had a bit more focus on driving the front end and the sales channel more recently. So, how does that look today? How do you feel about that now versus maybe when you stepped into the role?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","I feel really good about what's happening on the front end of our business. And we wanted to make our customer-facing capability as really as strong as our operational and engineering capability. And we're using some tools. I talked about that growth kaizens in the prior call where we're getting after ways to improve our distribution channel in our niche markets. We have a focus on digital marketing now to take some of our businesses that are truly world-class and bring all of them up to that level. We have a program on sales force effectiveness that involves the leadership development and compensation of our sales force. We're focusing on the aftermarket side of our business. We think there's opportunities to grow there. So, I'm very pleased with what's happening in the front end of our business and the focus on improving organic growth.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, Dave.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is now open.","Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, good morning. The prior commentary, you talked about or at least referenced broad-based growth globally, geographically. So, I was just curious if you could drill down into that how the various geographies look, and specifically, I know North America, it kind of lag Asia, Europe through the first half of the year. And specifically, maybe give some color on North America and which businesses you're seeing gain some strength there, because seemingly that's the case.","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. That's an excellent point, because what we really saw this quarter was tremendous strength in the U.S. Our U.S. business was up high-single digits, and it was improving sequential trend from about, I think it was low-single-digit, 1% actually last quarter. So, we saw a tremendous strength in the U.S. and it was broad-based strength. It was a military business. It was our aerospace business. It was our metals business, it was oil and gas. It was really strong. It was across the board. So, we're very pleased to see that.","In Europe, we were up mid-single digits, in line with recent trends. That was also broad based, and notable strength. I mentioned our Dunkermotoren business was very strong in Europe. Our process business was very strong in Europe. And in Asia, we had another great quarter, up high-single digits, continuing the growth that we've been seeing. So, across the geographies, we're very pleased with what we're seeing.","Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And so, just one follow-up. So, it has been good to see the outlook ratchet up as we've gone through the year and I think you made reference to higher compensation as well. Any way to size what that year-over-year delta is going to probably shake out for 2017 in compensation or as a margin headwind year-over-year?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, our G&A in Q3 was up about 20%, and it was largely driven by higher compensation expense. So, that would be the best way to-Bill?","William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.","It's a $10 million kind of number for that.","Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","For the full year?","David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.","For the full year.","Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time. So, with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.","Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Andrew. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

I will now turn the meeting over to Frank.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a strong second quarter with excellent operating performance. We delivered a record level of earnings at the high end of our guidance range despite what remains a slow global growth environment. We also continued to be very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we acquired Global Tubes, a leading manufacturer of high precision, small diameter metal tubing, and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed the acquisition of the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation.","I will provide some further details on our continued strong acquisition activity in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were up 1% to $1 billion. Organic sales were flat while acquisitions added 5% and currency was a 4% headwind. Operating income for the quarter was very strong. It increased 4% to a record $240.3 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was excellent at 23.9%, a 50-basis-point improvement over the second quarter of 2014. Net income rose 4% to $155.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.64, up 5% over last year's second quarter. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was up 5% to $163 million.","Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very strong quarter. Sales were up 4% to $596.5 million on strength in our Aerospace business plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Zygo and Amptek in our Process business. Organic sales were up 1%, acquisitions added 7% and foreign currency was a 4% headwind. EIG's operating performance was outstanding. Operating income increased 8% to $164 million and operating margins were 27.5%, up 110 basis points from last year's second quarter.","The Electromechanical Group also had a good quarter with strong operating performance. Overall sales were down 2% to $407.3 million. The lower sales were driven largely by currency headwinds with the contribution from the acquisition of Global Tubes, a partial offset. Organic sales were down 2% driven by continued weak global macro conditions, foreign currency was a five-point headwind and acquisitions contributed four points. EMG's operating income declined 3% to $89.3 million while operating margins were very solid at 21.9%.","Now turning to our four global strategies of: Operational Excellence; Global & Market Expansion; New Product Development; and Strategic Acquisitions. First I will touch on Acquisitions. We continue to remain very active, acquiring two excellent businesses since our last earnings call. Thus far in 2015, we have deployed approximately $360 million in capital and acquired approximately $180 million in revenue on these two acquisitions. Over the last 24 months, we've acquired 10 businesses, deployed over $1.3 billion in capital and acquired nearly $650 million in revenue. Our acquisition pipeline remains very strong. Now let me provide some highlights on the two recent acquisitions.","First, Global Tubes; Global Tubes manufactures high precision, small diameter metal tubing from stainless steel, nickel alloys, zirconium alloys and titanium for very specialized applications. These highly specialized products are manufactured of very tight tolerances and customer specifications for demanding applications within the aerospace, medical, nuclear, and oil and gas markets. Global Tubes is a really good strategic fit with our Specialty Metals business. It allows us to expand our product offering into a number of attractive market segments, while also expanding our Specialty Metals presence within Europe. Global Tubes is comprised of two businesses: Superior Tube, based in Collegeville, Pennsylvania and Fine Tubes based in the UK. Global Tubes has annual sales of approximately $120 million.","Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation. The Surface Inspection Systems Division or SISD develops and manufactures software-enabled vision systems used to inspect surfaces of continuously processed materials for flaws and defects. SISD's proprietary high-speed defect recognition technology detects, classifies and accurately maps specific defects over the entire area of the surface. This business is also an excellent strategic acquisition for AMETEK as it expands our presence in the non-destructive process inspection market. In addition, SISD will be able to leverage a number of AMETEK's complementary technologies and products within its vision systems. SISD is headquartered in Hayward, California, and has annual sales of about $60 million.","Now turning to Global & Market Expansion; Global & Market Expansion continues to be an important driver for our growth through the expansion of our presence in attractive, higher growth market segments and geographic regions. In the second quarter of 2015, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. We continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities, and manufacturing footprint, in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities.","For example, we continue to make sizable investments in both India and Serbia to drive our Global & Market Expansion initiatives. In India, our business continues to add sales and service capabilities to support increased demand for our products and technology. Additionally, we've been very pleased with the tremendous success of our Engineering Center of Excellence in India. As a result, we continue to expand and then broaden our RD&E capabilities and infrastructure in that region.","In Serbia, we have a low-cost manufacturing facility which was acquired as part of the Dunkermotoren acquisition in 2012. This facility primarily serves our Precision Motion Control customers in Europe and the Middle East. As other AMETEK businesses identify incremental growth opportunities in Europe and especially the Middle East, we are expanding our presence within Serbia to adequately support their growth.","Now turning to New Product Development, we continue to see excellent results from our New Product Development efforts. Our businesses are doing a great job developing new products to serve both their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets or applications. We'll continue to make sizable investments in RD&E to ensure we are developing the right products to serve our customers in target markets. In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E, or approximately 5% of sales.","We've made a number of recent new product introductions. SPECTRO Analytical Instruments, a global leader in instruments for advanced elemental analysis, introduced their new portable SPECTROSCOUT X-ray fluorescence spectrometer designed for at-line use. This durable and compact XRF analyzer delivers reliable, precise and fast laboratory-quality elemental composition monitoring and quality control testing for the field or manufacturing floor. The new SPECTROSCOUT delivers results onsite, eliminating the need to transport samples back to a quality-control laboratory.","Zygo, a leader in optical metrology solutions, high-precision optics and optical assemblies, released its Verifire XL high-precision large aperture Fizeau interferometer. It is the latest addition to Zygo's industry-leading line of phase-shifting laser interferometers, and is designed to measure large plano surfaces such as mirrors, semiconductor wafers, and wafer chucks. The product is a compact, cost-effective and complete turnkey solution with a highly-accurate characterization of flat surfaces up to 12 inches in diameter. To further increase precision and reliability, this new Zygo product incorporates a vibration isolation platform from another AMETEK business, our TMC business.","Lastly, Solidstate Controls, a recognized leader in highly-customized uninterruptible power supplies, has released its DSE UPS system. This new DSE system is an industry first; it combines the robust design of a ferroresonant transformer with the enhanced digital communications, monitoring, and diagnostic capabilities of a pulse width modulation UPS system. It is a true, on-line, double-conversion UPS system that provides highly reliable, clean, and regulated power for critical AC loads in demanding process control applications. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 24% of sales in the second quarter, up from 22% in last year's second quarter; it's a very high number, which we're very proud of.","Lastly, I will touch on Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. We continue to see tremendous results from our various Operational Excellence initiatives. Our teams continue to do an excellent job driving operational improvements in their business by leveraging the numerous Operational Excellence tools we have in place throughout the company.","In low-growth environments, the success of our Operational Excellence initiatives takes on even greater importance, so we are able to continue to drive meaningful margin expansion, while allowing us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall, in 2015, we anticipate approximately $145 million of total Operational Excellence savings, and we believe that's a conservative number. The largest contributor to this savings is our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, where we expect approximately $70 million in savings in 2015.","Turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015, we anticipate 2015 revenue to be up low single-digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Organic growth is expected to be roughly flat for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. We continue to expect adjusted earnings for 2015 to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over last year's adjusted earnings per share. Third quarter 2015 sales are expected to be approximately flat versus the third quarter of 2014. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.64 to $0.65 per diluted share in the third quarter, up 3% to 5% over last year's third quarter.","So in summary, we delivered strong results in the second quarter with record earnings. While global growth remains challenging, we are very confident in our ability to execute on our growth strategies and to deliver excellent earnings growth. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy.","Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions.","Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a good second quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details.","In the quarter, selling expenses were down slightly versus last year's second quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales, slightly above last year's second quarter level of 1.2%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.7%, down slightly from last year's second quarter rate of 28%. For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be between 28% and 28.5%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate.","On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.1% of sales in the second quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital expenditures were $12 million for the quarter. Full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $37 million for the quarter and 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. Operating cash flow was $163 million in the second quarter, up 5% over last year's second quarter. Free cash flow was $152 million in the quarter, up 8% over last year's second quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow, excluding the $50 million pension contribution made in the first quarter, to be approximately 115% of net income.","Total debt was $1.67 billion at June 30, down slightly from the 2014 yearend. This amount reflects the second funding from the private placement agreement we entered into last September. This funding of $50 million was received on June 15 and was used to pay down revolver debt. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $327 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at June 30 of 27.9%. At June 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives.","During the second quarter, we acquired Global Tubes. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation, bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2015 to approximately $360 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.","In summary, we had a very strong second quarter, and delivered solid operating results. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.","Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Bob. Tara, we'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please proceed.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. I just wanted to just ask if you could do your thing with each of the business units and what have you? And maybe before that just tell us what pricing was in the quarter for the company?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Pricing was up 1.5%, and I can add that the total inflation across the company was such that the net of pricing minus inflation was 0.6%.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, sure, Scott, I'd be glad to go through my normal discussion of the various subparts of the two groups. And I'll start with EIG. EIG Aerospace had a very solid second quarter. Overall growth was up low single digits against a very difficult comparison. We saw strong growth in our regional and business jet business and continued solid growth in our commercial business.","EIG Aerospace continues to gain additional content on a number of attractive platforms, really as a result of their strong technology and service capabilities. Very importantly, thus far in 2015, we have won over $400 million in new lifer program awards (21:25) on over 20 different platforms, including the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engine on the Airbus 330neo. Our team in this business has really done an excellent job. For all of 2015, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up mid-single digits, driven by the continued ramp up of key commercial OEM platforms and solid growth in business and regional jets.","The second part of EIG is our Process businesses. Overall Process sales were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis. Overall growth benefited from the acquisitions that we did in Process, they were Zygo and Amptek, and from solid growth in our Material Analysis and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses. Organic sales were flat as a result of weakness in our Upstream Oil & Gas business. The weakness that we've seen in Oil & Gas is in line with our original expectations at the start of the year. In 2015, we expect organic sales growth to be down slightly versus 2014.","And the last part of EIG is Power and Industrial. Our Power and Industrial businesses had a very good second quarter. Organic sales were up mid-single digits with solid growth across both our Power and Industrial businesses. And in 2015 for the whole year, we expect our organic sales for Power and Industrial to be up low-single digits. So, if you take the sum of those three, for all of EIG, we're expecting organic sales to be approximately flat for 2014 (sic) [2015] (23:19).","Moving to EMG, starting with the differentiated part of EMG, overall sales were down low-single digits on a percentage basis in the quarter as foreign currency headwinds were only partially offset by the contribution from the Global Tubes acquisition. Organically, we saw a solid growth in our Precision Motion Control business, but weakness in our Engineered Materials Interconnect & Packaging business due to the continued soft macro environment. For 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be approximately flat organically.","And the last part of the company, our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business, organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were flat in the second quarter, and for 2015, we expect sales for this business to be up low-single digits organically. So in 2015, for all of EMG, thus we expect roughly flat organic sales growth on a percentage basis.","So, sort of the bottom line here is with organic growth very difficult for just about every industrial company, the focus really becomes cost. And we've done an excellent job, as typical of AMETEK, in terms of reducing our cost structure and obviously getting record earnings and record performance as a result. So, Scott, that's sort of a recap of what you asked for.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC","That's perfect, Frank. Thank you very much.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Allison.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","How are you? Just following on the prior comments, Energy sounds like it's coming in line with what you're looking at. I guess I don't know have the notes from last quarter, but what's become progressively weaker that you're now expecting a sort of lower organic for this year?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There's no question just the general industrial environment is softer than we had expected. Europe is obviously having difficulties and in Asia as well, the growth, while still overall we're relatively bullish on Asia, there's no question that the overall growth is slower. So, it's not specific in any given business, Allison, it's just a general sort of slow macro. And getting back to my point that I mentioned with Scott, we have been very aggressive on the cost side of the business and, as I stated, the $145 million of cost reductions is actually a conservative number, and therefore we've got really good confidence in our earnings, given the global macro.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's great. And then just touching on the operating side, I imagine there's some acquisition-related accounting and cost in that number. Do you have a sense of what the \u2013 I mean I imagine the organic expansion of those businesses were much higher. Can you touch on that a little bit?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You're talking about the costs that go through the P&L as a result of buying these businesses. It's probably on the order of a $0.01.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Oh, okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's the magnitude of it. So, you couple those costs with the currency impacts, which although not off the charts, we lost another couple of pennies in terms of earnings in the quarter as a result of this. So, that's why these cost reductions become so critical; you're just fighting a number of headwinds.","Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You bet, Allison.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Mark.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Payables were?","Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","$384 million.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","$384 million. Great, thank you.","Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Frank, you mentioned Europe and then Asia were a little disappointing. You grew mid-teens in China in first quarter, so I think it was a real surprise to everybody; that was a very good number. I assume you've seen the slowdown in China catch up to you, and then can you size what China is now? And what the slowdown is like there?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean if I give you a geographic look at our business, Europe was down about 4% organically and obviously, that's just a result of the general economic condition in Europe. In Asia, we were actually down 6%, but that was against a very tough comparison. Organically last year, in the second quarter, Asia actually had 15% organic growth, so it was a very difficult comparison, so we don't expect that it's going to be down that much as we go forward, but again, it's not going to be as robust as it was a number of quarters ago. And actually, the best performance was in the U.S., which was up about 5% organically. And when you sum those, based on our heavy concentration outside the U.S., that's how you get to the relatively flat organic growth overall.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","U.S. is up 5%, is that related to your Power and Industrial also being up mid-single digits? That was...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the Power and Industrial segment was good; the Aerospace business in particular was very good in the U.S. So, they were key drivers to our performance and also, our Precision Motion Control business on the EMG side of the business had very strong U.S. performance. So I think, if you just step back from those parts of the world, it's kind of reflective of what's happening in the global environment in each of those businesses. The U.S. is getting better, albeit slowly, but it is getting better. Europe is tough, and Asia is slowing. And that's sort of the global picture.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Just finally on the power and industrial, can you go into a little bit of detail, what businesses within there, or what markets, were particularly good for you?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, well, the good thing there is, both power and industrial were very, very good. In the industrial side, although a small part of overall AMETEK, the heavy vehicle business continues to do very well, and it triggered very good growth in the industrial piece. If you look at North American heavy truck sales, it's estimated this year to be about 325,000 trucks, which is up about 10% over last year. So we are enjoying that.","If we look at our power business and you break it down, there's really three parts to the power business. There's a test and measurement piece of the power business; there's a battery backup piece of the power business; and then there's instrumentation for the generation, transmission and distribution part of our power business. And the latter two of those had good growth in the quarter. And that business is performing quite well for us. And their earnings were excellent in the quarter. And so we're very pleased. We got really good management in that business, and they're doing an excellent job. And it's now becoming a sizeable part of AMETEK, with over $0.5 billion in sales on an annual basis.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Matt.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Could you give me a sense of how the stronger dollar might be impacting your sales? And not just on the translation side, but are you seeing any international projects get delayed or pushed out? Or any pressure on your export sales? Just what impact might you be seeing outside of translation?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm going to let David take this one.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Yes, Matt, it's a great question. Fortunately, AMETEK is relatively balanced on revenues and costs around the world. But the strong dollar does cause some competitive situations in \u2013 we're in niche markets. We're leaders in niche markets and largely what we see is the delay of projects when people can't get the U.S. dollars necessary to go forward with projects. So they're usually delayed three months, six months to go back and get the money. This has happened before, and certainly we're seeing some of that.","Because we're at the top of our niches and technology, we're not seeing a lot of negative impacts. But certainly, anytime the currency changes, there are some businesses that are impacted by the stronger dollar. The cases where we're manufacturing in the U.S. and we have competitors in Europe or Japan, the environment is tougher. Conversely, AMETEK does manufacture in Europe and Asia, and we have to take advantage of that to our competitive advantage.","So it's certainly an issue, but I think we're managing it well. We've done an analysis business by business, every business unit in the company, and we have plans in place to relocate to lower-cost regions. As Frank mentioned, we have 24% of sales from new products. We're really emphasizing new product development to enhance our competitive advantage. So it's an issue for every company. There is a competitive issue with it, but we're managing it well.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then maybe on free cash flow, I know you're running below 100% conversion, and that's probably from the pension contribution. But CapEx is down 10% year-to-date. The plan's for it to be up 5% for the year. Are there specific projects in the back half of the year, or acquisitions? Do you have capital spending plans for those, or anything else that would drive a pretty big ramp in CapEx in the back half of the year?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, actually, Bob and I discussed this recently, and I think it's unlikely that we're going to spend the $75 million in capital that we talked about. And part of the issue here, to be very upfront about it, is that the environment is tough, and our people are heavily focused on getting the revenue and getting the profit that we're looking for, so that it's just difficult to find the time to do some of the projects. So, I doubt very much that we're going to spend the full $75 million.","In terms of free cash flow, usually in the first part of the year, we always run below net income. But, if we look at the full year and actually extract that $50 million in pension contributions that you've mentioned, we actually expect free cash flow to net income to be about 115% of sales. And that's probably a conservative number. I mean we're just throwing off significant cash and it's sort of a hallmark of AMETEK and the second half will be very strong in terms of cash generation.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. That all makes sense.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Radigan with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Joe.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Frank, first on EMG, you've called out Precision Motion Control as an area of strength for a while now. I think that business has pretty diverse end markets. So can you talk about where you're seeing the growth come from in particular?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I mean this is really a great business and we've got excellent management in this business. And the model for the business is a very interesting one because it's different than most of our other businesses, in that we have a number of platforms in the business. And what this team does is when a customer comes in and needs a special motor for a given application, we can take a platform that is closest to that requirement and basically design or with very little engineering solve that customer's problem. So from the viewpoint of the customer, he's getting a highly specialized motor, whereas we don't have to do a lot of engineering in order to make that happen.","So this is, as you point out, very diverse. And what this business has recently done is expanded globally. They were predominantly a U.S. business, and with the acquisition of Dunkermotoren in Germany and real focus on growing in Asia, this company has diversified its global reach and it's basically looking at the stronger parts of the industrial market and being able to serve them well.","So, to me, this is an example of really strong management in a difficult global macro environment that is actually taking advantage of their approach to the market, and therefore their organic growth has been very good.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. And then a couple questions on aero. There's been several companies that have indicated that they've seen some weakness in the business jet market here recently. It doesn't sound like you're seeing that? So can you just comment on your outlook there?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes...","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And on the EMG side of aero. I'm sorry, go ahead.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Very good question. People have talked about the turnaround in the business and regional jet market for about three years now, and they've all been wrong in terms of predicting an upturn. And actually we're not seeing a major market change in this business. My view of it is that we're sort of bouncing along bottom and I think what you're hearing from other companies is that there's a little bit of an uptick and then it comes back down, so you're sort of on that cycle of bouncing along bottom.","Our growth here is purely not market-driven. It's from new product wins. We have major wins on HondaJet, for instance. We have major wins on other platforms like the Global Express, like Gulfstream aircraft. And you sum those and actually in the second quarter our business and regional jet business was up organically the most in AMETEK. It was up low-double digits. So it's all driven from platform wins, not market.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. That's very helpful. And then just lastly on aero on the EMG side, can you talk about what you're seeing in third-party MRO and military? Again, there's been a lot of mix commentary this earning season, so...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes...","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","...that's what you're seeing.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I'm going to give you some mix commentary as well. In terms of military, this has been an absolute surprise for us that actually when we look at military across the company, that would be both EMG and what we do in EIG. It was up low-single digits. So we're actually growing organically in military. I would have bet a fair amount of money that that wasn't going to happen. But we'll take it. We need it.","The third-party MRO was weak. It was weak in the quarter. We were actually down. But we also had a tough comparison, and if you look at the third-party MRO business overall, that market is growing 3% to 4%. That's basically the market dynamics right now. And we think that's the kind of growth that we're going to get and are getting, actually, if you look at it over a longer period of time. But the second quarter was weak.","Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Frank.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please proceed.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Robert.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So the first question, Frank, is, you've spoken a lot about your cost initiatives and the fact that they could be fairly conservative, and so this question gets to that. If we get into even a worse macro environment, clearly there's some conservatism there, but would you take another whole look given the fact that you've already highlighted the strong payback you announced with your $16 million or so of initiatives in the first quarter? How should we think about it if we go into a cyclical rollover? What kind of cost saves or cost actions could you take?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's a really good question. And it really depends on how significant a downturn would be. We have sized the company as we think is appropriate for the guidance that we've provided to you, both in terms of overall sales, organic sales and what we're expecting for the second half. You used the term rollover. If we're talking about a slight degradation, we'll be able to handle that. You just look, for instance, at the price of oil in the last few days where it has gone a little bit lower than actually when we put our presentation together here, but when we looked at it we said, it's not going to be significant to us. It could be a little bit slower than what we expect and we'll deal with it.","But if there's a major downturn \u2013 this is sort of the hallmark of AMETEK that there are always substantial things that you can do in the cost structure of a company. And our approach to our businesses where we're highly diversified with lots of manufacturing facilities, there are still opportunities for us to do more. We can do additional consolidation of facilities, we could be even more aggressive on our material cost reductions, we could move more production to low-cost locales, and if we got in a major downturn, we would shift some of our focus which, as Dave mentioned and I mentioned, is more right now on RD&E and the acquisition front, we would move even more of it to the cost side of the business.","And if I can just look back historically during the 2008 and 2009 downturn, our margins at the operating level were down just a little over 100 basis points. We were top of class. You go to the recession before that, our profit margins were actually up in the downturn. So this is sort of the core competency of our company, and the basic answer to your question is if things get worse, we will do more. And we'll get the cost structure aligned with the revenue. I hope we don't have to do that, but we'll be able to do it.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Understood. The second question is around acquisitions in association with \u2013 you highlighted your kind of track record over the past two years in terms of the acquired revenues and how much capital you deployed. In terms of doing the post mortem of those acquisitions, have you seen a superior organic growth rate from those acquisitions versus the core portfolio? And you are a harsh grader of yourself internally, but I mean how would you kind of give yourself a grade in terms of the acquisitions that have kind of come through the past two years? And do you think there's a problem in terms of your acquisition selection in terms of organic growth?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think so. We specifically have a focus on acquiring companies that are very high up the differentiation curve and, in general, the higher up the differentiation curve, the higher the organic growth of those companies. The issue is even when you roll through the acquisitions we've done, they're not a major part of the company. And some of that growth is also being muted by just the general macro conditions that we have talked a lot about on this call and most industrial companies are talking about. So I actually believe the organic growth of the companies that we acquired is higher than the base organic growth of the core business. And if we take the last one, the Cognex deal, Dave, you remember what it was, organic growth, before we acquired it, 5%, 6%, 7%? 6%?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It was 6%. Okay. 6% was the number. So yeah, that's a good number in this environment. And there that's just an example of the last one that we did.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","The third and final question, if you'll indulge me, is...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","...basically \u2013 and then this will be it, I promise, is you have been able to execute on some reasonable multiples, particularly in this M&A environment, I mean, you look at some of the public multiples being paid right now for some of these businesses as companies kind of search for growth and wrestle with the kind of portfolio transformation. Clearly companies of slightly larger deciles than yourself, but there are some very healthy multiples being paid. Are you nervous, given the fact that you've executed some reasonable deals in terms of EBITDA and the specter of slower growth that there could be a bid-ask issue in you being able to get deals done in the back half? And because you'll probably be walking away from \u2013 because seller expectation is going have to moderated, I guess is my point.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's a great question, Robert. If you look at this, we parse the deals that we look at because, you're absolutely right, some deals are just going for ridiculous multiples, and when you look at paying 15 times or 17 times trailing to get a return on invested capital that meets a reasonable criteria, and in particular our criteria is, it's virtually impossible unless you've got super growth with the business and\/or almost unbelievable types of cost synergies.","So we will parse those deals and we won't even spend any time on them because we're not going to get the return on invested capital that we target. Now having said that, our acquisition program has really been fruitful; we put a solid team in place; they're doing a super job, and a lot of the deals that are coming to our attention are coming up on a proprietary basis. And as a result of that, we're able to pay reasonable multiples. And I can remember like the last two deals we bought, they were 9 times kind of deals. And we can say that's reasonable in an environment where some companies are going for 15 times, but on the other hand, 9 times is probably a point more than we've historically paid.","So, there's just \u2013 you have to be cautious in terms of not overpaying for a business; and again, this speaks to the quality of our acquisition program, and our backlog is good right now. The free cash flow of the company this year is going to be on the order of $740 million. And my objective is to spend that free cash flow on acquisitions, and we're pretty much right on target. You look at what we've done in sort of the first half of the year, as Bob mentioned, we did $360 million, so we're right on target to spend that. And that's the best utilization of that capital, if we can take the free cash flow of the company, invest in businesses and then make them better, it's sort of a no-brainer from an economic analysis viewpoint.","So no, I'm not overly worried about it. One good metric that I like to focus on is nopac (48:32) to total average capital. And you look at this, and although we probably shouldn't look at it on a quarter basis, but in the second quarter, that number was just under 14%. So you look at our cost of capital which, depending on how you value cost of capital, a reasonable number for us would probably be 8%. So you take 8% and you get no pac (48:58) to total capital of 14%, we're creating sizable value. And that's the name of the game is, you got to create value. So I hope that helps.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great narrative. Thanks, Frank.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Frank, so seeing a little bit of a transformation in how the macro cycle is playing out relative to the last couple of cycles. I'm wondering if you've seen any changes in competitive landscape of any of the businesses, and in particular, with respect to your categorization of the portfolio, is serving the top of the top of the markets served. And I'm wondering if you're seeing any mix down in solution selection to kind of mid-tier solutions by any of the customer bases?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think that's a fair question. And I think the right answer is definitely, in this kind of environment, you see customers pushing down to some degree because, either they don't have the capital to spend or they're trying to have the capital that they do have go across a wider selection of products. So yeah, I don't think there's any question but that's a part of the dynamic that's occurring here. But in general, our products are differentiated enough that it's not a sizeable impact on the business, but it's definitely a factor. And I think it's just normal, actually, when the global macro is weak.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, definitely appears subtle. We've seen bigger top-line changes. Yours barely changed. Also, just would like a reminder on what the organic surge in Asia was last year, and how that carries through the balance of this year?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we had, last year, very big sales of our CAMECA products. These are very high-level systems. And there was very, very strong performance. And that business does cycle, as to where they get the business. And actually, in the first half of the year it wasn't even in China, a good part of that was in Japan. And this year we're not seeing that, so that had probably the most significant impact on the organic growth.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Good morning.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi Richard.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Frank, could you speak a little bit to orders, maybe what the order number was in the quarter and then, what the core order change was year-over-year?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the core orders were $1.035 billion in the quarter. The book-to-bill was 1.03. If you exclude backlog in both this year's second quarter as well as last year's, so that you get a sort of an equal comparison. Overall orders were flat. And from a organic viewpoint, they were down just a titch, just a very small amount. So it's pretty consistent with the sales and the picture that we're painting.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I understand. Okay. And then also, I was trying to think, when you went through your comments on the two segments, in EIG, am I correct, is the Process portion of EIG, you commented that Oil & Gas was down as expected, but was the balance of that business a bit weaker? Is the expectations faded there a little bit on the Process side for EIG? Or no?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, not really. Dave, you want to take that one?","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No, we had solid growth in Materials Analysis and our Ultra Precision Technology Division.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","It's probably Q2 and the Oil & Gas was weaker, but they essentially offset and we were flat.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I understand. And then also, just one quick question on the midstream and downstream Oil & Gas business, I know the expectation there was for a modest decline this year. Has there been any acceleration or deceleration again in the mid and downstream spend?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, that's exactly \u2013 we went out and checked this with our businesses, and factually in Q2, it was down slightly, and we queried our businesses about what they expected for the rest of the year, and that's the expectation. Now, as I mentioned, the price of oil has come down a little bit in the last two days and will that have an impact? It could have a modest impact and it could be a little bit weaker than what we're talking about, but again, when we discussed that actually this morning, we said, we've got the cost handled here, so we've got really good confidence on our earnings for the year.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And I recall the mid-downstream piece was expected to track down maybe 5%, upstream down 20%, and that's how you were weighting (54:32) for this 10% number, and that's those two...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Your numbers are close.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It was 25% on the upstream and a few points on the mid and downstream piece.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Okay. And then just one real last question; did you say that the FX impact on the EPS line was $0.02 in the quarter?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you. And nice work in the quarter.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Richard.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Please proceed.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors","Good morning, guys.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Matt. Welcome back.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors","Thank you. Hey, I was hoping you could give a little bit of clarity as to the linearity you saw in terms of orders, and what you've seen in July. I would imagine you have a preliminary order number by now.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Through the second quarter, orders actually went up, so we saw a positive trend on orders. For July, we have orders and sales data. We don't have profitability data yet. We'll have that in another day or two. But on orders and sales, they were basically in line with the forecast that I've given you. So we have pretty good confidence going into the beginning at least of Q2 that the estimates are going to hold.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors","And then just with respect to Oil & Gas, is your sense, again thinking about linearity, is your business bottoming? Is it getting worse? And what sort of oil price do you feel we would need to see for your business, particularly on the upstream side obviously, to start to reaccelerate?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's a great question, and there's a lot of the data in the industry as to what's the price of oil where you'll see expansion. And I think our consensus is it's a number like $70 a barrel. If you get up to that $70-plus a barrel, you're going to start to see expansion. One of the reasons that I actually have not highlighted yet on this call as to why maybe AMETEK isn't seeing as significant an impact as some other companies is that we're not as, in terms of our content, we're not as much focused on fracking in the U.S. Our business is much more internationally focused. And as a result of that, the estimates that we put together at the beginning of the year are pretty much \u2013 are holding, basically.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors","And then just lastly, if you could, you have $145 million that you've committed to in terms of cost savings. You've mentioned several times there's upside to that. I guess, what could the upside scenario look like? And then could you remind us if $70 million comes from sourcing and procurement, what our major buckets are to get you to $145 million, please?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. On the $145 million, about $70 million is a result of activities that are directly sourcing-related. And that would include our strategic procurement initiatives. It even includes our value engineering activities where we will do some minor redesign of products and lower the material content as a result of that value engineering and value analysis work. So that's about $70 million of the $145 million. And the remaining, I guess, $75 million is all of the actions that we have done in terms of plant consolidations, reductions in force in those businesses that have had the most significant impact as a result of the macro environment, et cetera. In terms of the first part of your question, we have not actually rolled that up. But I think a number on the order of $10 million is very realistic.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors","Great. Thanks a lot, Frank.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And that gives you a flavor as to why we're comfortable with the estimate.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors","Perfect. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Drew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Drew on for Nigel.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Nigel.","Drew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","This is Drew. But the...","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Drew.","Drew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Could you just go back to the third-party MRO real quick, you mentioned the market's growing 3% to 4%. Do you have any sense for when that turns back positive for you guys?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think next quarter. Yeah, I think the reason the quarter was down was mainly due to the comparison that I talked about, so I think we're going to see some growth out of MRO next quarter.","Drew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just lastly on the organic growth in 3Q, could you just kind of clarify what you're looking for there? Kind of looks like the 1% to 2% implies could be down next quarter?","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Flat. We're actually talking about a flat number. But yeah, I mean, if Oil & Gas gets a little bit worse, you might see a minus 1%, that's possible; but we're calling flat right now.","Drew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time.","Kevin C.

For the full-year, we established records for essentially all key financial metrics. We delivered 7% organic sales growth and 26% growth in diluted earnings per share. We generated record cash flows which we successfully deployed on strategic acquisitions and we continued to invest on our businesses to position them for long-term success.","In addition to the impressive result for the full-year, we also had a fantastic fourth quarter with record results. Sales were up low-double-digits driven by strong acquisition contributions and continued solid organic growth. Orders also grew at a strong pace and we ended the year with a record backlog.","Operating profit growth and operating margin expansion in the quarter were excellent leading to a high quality of earnings that exceeded expectations.","We remained very active investing on our strong cash flows, deploying over $750 million on three acquisitions, and $364 million on an opportunistic share repurchases in the quarter. We also bolstered the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet with an expanded revolving credit line and completed a private placement debt offering providing us significant capacity to pursue future growth opportunities.","Now for the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.3 billion, up 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Organic sales growth was solid at 5% with acquisitions contributing 7% in foreign currency, a 1% headwind. Orders also remain very solid, overall orders were up 11% over the prior year with organic orders up 5%. Another positive book-to-bill quarter resulted in a record backlog of more than $1.6 billion providing us with solid visibility as we enter 2019.","EBITDA in the quarter was a record $332 million, up 22% over the prior year period with EBITDA margins a very strong 26.1%.","Operating income in the quarter was a record $282 million, up 14% over the same quarter last year, with reported operating margin of 22.2% up 50 basis points over the prior year period. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins increased an impressive 130 basis points over last year's fourth quarter.","Diluted earnings per share were a record $0.86 in the quarter representing an outstanding 23% increase over the prior year's fourth quarter earnings.","Now for the full-year 2018 results. AMETEK delivered annual record essentially on all key financial metrics in 2018. Overall sales were up 13% to $4.8 billion. Organic sales grew an impressive 7%, acquisitions contributed 5%, and foreign currency was a one point benefit. Overall orders were up 11% and organic orders were also up 7% in 2018.","Full-year operating income was $1.1 billion and operating margins were up 70 basis points to 22.2%. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, 2018 operating margins were up an impressive 110 basis points over 2017. Full-year diluted earnings per share were $3.29, up 26% over the prior year.","Now turning to the fourth quarter results of the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Fourth quarter sales for EIG were up 11% to a record $826 million. Recent acquisitions contributed 8%, organic sales grew 4%, and foreign currency was a one point headwind. We continue to see strong growth across our process businesses, with particular strength on our Materials Analysis businesses.","EIG's operating income in the quarter was a record $214.6 million, up 11% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Reported operating margins were 26%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG margins were up a robust 130 basis points versus the prior year.","The Electromechanical Group had another excellent quarter with strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance. EMG sales in the fourth quarter were $445.3 million, up 11% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Organic sales growth was very strong at 9%, while the acquisition of FMH Aerospace contributed 3%, and foreign currency was a one point headwind. Sales grew nicely across all EMG businesses in the quarter with particular strength across our aerospace and engineered materials businesses.","EMG's operating performance in the quarter was outstanding with operating income increasing 18% to $85.8 million and operating margins expanding 110 basis points to 19.3%.","So to summarize, AMETEK delivered tremendous performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Each of our businesses continue to deliver exceptional results through the execution of AMETEK growth model which combines our four growth strategies with a disciplined focus on cash generation and capital deployment to create long-term value for all of AMETEK's stakeholders.","I would like to thank all AMETEK colleagues for their exceptional work and success in 2018.","Before I discuss our outlook for 2019, I wanted to highlight some of the efforts our businesses are taking to drive the future of AMETEK. I will start with acquisitions. 2018 was an exciting year on the acquisition front having deployed a record level of capital to acquire six outstanding businesses. We deployed over $1.1 billion on capital on these acquisitions and acquired approximately $350 million in annual sales. In the fourth quarter alone, we completed three acquisitions.","Forza and Telular which I highlighted during our last earnings call and Spectro Scientific which we acquired in late November. Spectro Scientific is a leading provider of machine condition monitoring solutions for critical assets and high-value industrial applications. They offer differentiated solutions that serve the increasing need for productive maintenance in a broad and growing set of end-markets. Spectro Scientific provides both lab-based and onsite instrumentation including consumables, and cloud-based software analytics to help customers determine the model of the condition of lubricants and fluids in mission critical equipment. They're based in Chelmsford, Mass, and have approximately $50 million in annual sales. Spectro Scientific along with the other businesses acquired in 2018 are integrating very nicely into AMETEK and we expect them to add tremendous value going forward.","In addition to deploying a record level of capital and acquisitions, we also deployed $364 million on share repurchases during the quarter, bringing the total capital deployed in 2018 to nearly $1.5 billion. Acquisitions clearly remain the number one priority for capital deployment. As we have done in the past, we will continue to repurchase our shares opportunistically and will continue to pay a modest dividend to our shareholders.","Despite the record level of capital deployment, we have significant capacity available to continue our acquisition strategy and Bill will touch on this further in a moment.","We remain focused on investing back in our businesses to support the growth initiatives. In 2018, we invested approximately $75 million in incremental growth opportunities. These investments were focused across our sales and marketing and research development and engineering content. We're seeing excellent results from these initiatives as we continue to drive strong organic sales growth.","One important driver of this organic sales growth is new product development. In the fourth quarter our vitality index which measures the level of sales generated for new products and solutions introduced within the last three years was excellent at 25%. The traction that our new products are gaining in the respective market speak to the success of our research, development, and engineering efforts.","We also remain focused on expanding our footprint across the globe and to new adjacent markets. In October, we celebrated the opening of our newest technology solutions center in Bangalore, India. The center showcases the latest products and technologies of many of AMETEK's businesses and is designed to assist customers in selecting the right equipment and enhance our service platforms within the region. This facility greatly enhances our ability to expand our position in India's attractive growth market.","We will continue to expand our global sales channels, develop additional service capabilities, and add to our manufacturing flexibility to better serve our customers and support global growth.","Lastly, our operational excellence initiatives continue to drive strong improvements in the operating performance as was seen in our margin expansion in the fourth quarter and full-year results.","In 2018, we generated approximately $90 million in savings from our operational excellence initiatives, largely driven by our global sourcing and strategic procurement efforts. We also remain focused on driving top-line growth through our expanded commercial excellence toolkit which continues to drive additional market share gains across our businesses. These key strategies make-up the cornerstone of AMETEK's growth model and will remain a strong focus as we move into 2019.","Now let me provide some brief comments on tariffs. Our businesses continue to do a tremendous job managing each of the work streams we have put in place to help address the effects of tariffs. Our situation remains fluid. We remain very confident in our ability to mitigate the headwinds from the announced tariffs given our ability to capture incremental pricing due to the highly differentiated nature of our business, the strength and flexibility of our global supply chain, and our ability to ship production given our asset-light business model. AMETEK's proven Operational Excellence capability, which captures each of these elements positions us extremely well to offset the impacts from tariffs. In the fourth quarter, we will be able to fully offset the direct impact from tariffs and for all of 2019; we also expect we will be able to offset the impact of known tariffs through our various initiatives.","Now I will move to our outlook for the year. As we noted in our press release, going forward, we will report EPS results and guidance on an adjusted basis that adds back non-cash after-tax acquisition related intangible amortization. We believe providing this non-GAAP measure allows our shareholders to better understand the strength of our cash flow generation and core operating results and aligns more comparably to our acquisitive peers.","With that said, we expect 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.05, an increase of 8% to 11% over the comparable results in 2018.","We expect overall sales in 2019 to be up high-single-digits. Organic sales are expected to be up 3% to 5% with a similar level of organic growth across each reportable segment.","For the first quarter, we anticipate sales will be up high-single-digits, adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.95 to $0.97 per diluted share, and 9% to 11% increase over the prior year.","To conclude, our teams performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and delivered outstanding results in 2018. We are firmly positioned to achieve another year of solid growth and sustainable long-term success to the execution of the AMETEK growth model.","I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?","Bill Burke","Thank you, Dave.","As Dave highlighted, AMETEK finished the year with a strong performance and a high quality of earnings in the fourth quarter. I will provide some additional financial details but first a brief comment on the fourth quarter tax related gain. As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, AMETEK recognized a net gain in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax liabilities and the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. This gain was considered provisional and was subject to further adjustments during the measurement period. The $11.8 million or $0.05 we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 was the finalization of the provisional adjustments from Tax Reform.","Now on to the additional financial highlights. Core selling expense was up in line with core sales in the quarter.","General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were down slightly over the prior year and were 1.5% of sales in the quarter, down from 1.6% of sales in last year's fourth quarter. 2019 general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2018 levels.","The adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 22.8% and in line with our expectations. This compares to last year's adjusted rate of 25.7%. The year-over-year reduction in our effective tax rate was due to the benefits of Tax Reform. In 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. As we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate.","Working capital in the quarter was very solid at 16.9% of sales essentially in line with last year's fourth quarter.","Capital expenditures were $35 million for the quarter and $82 million for the full-year. We expect capital expenditures in 2019 to be approximately $100 million or 1.9% of sales reflecting our asset-light business model.","Depreciation and amortization expense was $54 million in the fourth quarter and $200 million for the full-year. In 2019, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $235 million including acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $130 million or $0.43 per diluted share.","As Dave mentioned, our businesses continue to generate excellent levels of cash flow. Fourth quarter operating cash flow and free cash flow were both records at $296 million and $262 million respectively with both up 17% over the prior year.","Free cash flow conversion for the quarter was outstanding at 131% of adjusted net income. Our full-year cash flow was also very strong, operating cash flow for 2018 was $926 million, and free cash flow was $843 million, both of these metrics up 11% over the prior year.","We remain focused on deploying our strong free cash flow on strategic acquisitions, and as Dave mentioned, AMETEK had an outstanding year on this front. In all of 2018, we deployed more than $1.1 billion on six acquisitions with approximately $750 million deployed on three acquisitions in the fourth quarter alone.","In addition, we deployed $368 million on share repurchases in 2018, with $364 million of the repurchases occurring in the fourth quarter.","Total debt at December 31st was $2.63 billion, up from $2.17 billion at the end of 2017. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $354 million. Following our record level of capital deployment in 2018, we still have significant capacity to support our growth initiatives with more than $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities. These amounts reflect the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended and upsized revolving credit facility we announced in November and which I discussed during our last call as well as the private placement offering we announced in mid-December.","The private placement offering consisted of $660 million of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 3.93% and a weighted average maturity of 8.2 years. The proceeds were used to pay outstanding borrowings on our revolver as well as a maturing $100 million senior note in December.","To summarize, our businesses delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter to complete an exceptional year. Looking ahead to 2019, our outlook is positive as we are well-positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?","Kevin Coleman","Thanks, Bill. Jimmy could we please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Scott Graham","So I have two questions, one on organic and one on the savings which is easy, the 3% to 5% organic guidance, I'm just wondering two things on this, your orders, organic orders have been running at 5% or better for quite some time. You had a pretty good fourth quarter, I'm just wondering is there something relative to the orders where maybe that's maybe a little bit longer-term that would be keeping the guidance to 3% to 5%? And then secondly what gets you to the 5%?","Dave Zapico","Right, I appreciate the question. We\u2019re expecting solid growth in 2019. But we do expect the growth to moderate compared to 2018 and the growth is moderating a bit because of the global uncertainties and the trade tensions but we expect to continue to grow nicely. And certainly the comparisons will make it more difficult.","We just completed eight quarters with average organic growth of 6% and six straight quarters with a positive book-to-bill. So and we ended the year with a record backlog. So overall we feel very good about the environment where we're operating in, and we feel good what we're hearing from our businesses and our customers and we continue to see solid underlying demand and we're positioned to perform very well in this environment and we're executing very well. But there is a little bit of global uncertainty and our guidance takes that into account.","Scott Graham","Got it. Thank you. And then secondly on the savings, I know you mentioned that most of the $90 million in savings this year was from global procurement. I was wondering if you can kind of maybe specifically parse that out global procurement versus the other areas and what you're expecting that -- on that from each for 2019 as well?","Dave Zapico","Sure, sure, Scott. And as you know we started the year in 2018 with an $80 million guide for cost savings and those are cost savings that actually work their way through the P&L. And where we ended up, we did a little bit better than that and it was largely driven by our sourcing initiatives. So we ended up at $90 million as you mentioned about $70 million of that was from sourcing and about $20 million was from other OpEx initiatives. And for 2019, we're starting the guide at $80 million, about $60 million of that will come from sourcing initiatives and strategic procurement initiatives, and about $20 million from other OpEx initiatives. Does that answer your question?","Scott Graham","Thanks a lot. Yes.","Dave Zapico","Okay. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe","Yes, I want to get away from the ops for a second and just talk about the share repos in 4Q, I mean you're not known for being a heavy repurchase company. So is that a reflection of the M&A options on the table here that the backlog or is it more a reflection of your share price that's in the November\/December and supporting your stock at those levels but the real question is how does the M&A backlog look from here?","Dave Zapico","Yes, the M&A backlog looks great. We just completed a record year and I think the pipeline looks equivalent to what it looked like as we entered 2018. So for 2019 we have a very strong pipeline. Over time, we have an opportunistic view of share purchases and we see the market adjust like it did in the fourth quarter and we have a strong balance sheet. We thought it was a good time to buy back some shares. And in the past that has been a good investment for AMETEK shareholders when we made that decision.","Nigel Coe","I agree with that. And then --","Dave Zapico","When you think about our balance sheet, Nigel, we entered 2018 with a debt-to-EBITDA of about 1.95% -- of 1.95%. We end 2018 at the same level, 1.96%. So we deployed over $1.5 billion on acquisitions and M&A and we still have the same debt-to-EBITDA. So it's really the strong balance sheet, the strong cash flow generation and generating capability of the company and the fact that we can control our own destiny to a certain degree.","Nigel Coe","Great. And then one question two parts, what have you seen in China, you got a recently large exposure to China about terms of the sales, what you see in there by major business? And then on tariffs, you talked about how you're accompanying couple of tariffs, do you have list 3 25% priced right now or do you have to go out and re-price if we do get that step up in March?","Dave Zapico","Right, great question. The list 3 is built into our guidance, so we assumed in March 1st that the tariff would go to 25%, that's built into our guide and as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel comfortable that we will be able to offset the impact of tariffs completely.","And regarding to China, China is an important market for us, it's about 9% of our sales and China grew nicely in the quarter, it drove overall Asia growth of 12% and there was a bit higher than the overall Asia growth and certainly the trade situation with China has a complexity that we're watching very closely.","So far we continue to grow nicely but we're going to continue to monitor that. As I've said before the reality is that we produce products that China market needs to upgrade their manufacturing capability to monitor to nuclear power plants and help clean up their environment. We are expecting growth to moderate in 2019 more in line with AMETEK's overall growth but we feel good about that level of growth in China for 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Matt Summerville","Can you first talk about how much price you guys actually realized in 2018 and based upon the comments you just made, David, how much price do you anticipate realizing for 2019?","Dave Zapico","Sure, Matt. As you will recall, during the year we increased our pricing as we got ahead of tariffs and inflation and Q4 was misolate [ph] Q3. Q4 we had an excellent quarter, we achieved a bit more than 2% of price across our entire portfolio. Total inflation was about 1.5%. So we're very pleased with these results and we think we're well-positioned to continue the trend in 2019.","Specifically for 2019, we're expecting about two points of price and about the same level on total inflation about 1.5 points. So the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of our AMETEK portfolio and our leadership position in niche markets and our focus and determination to make sure we stay in front of the global changing environment. So we're feeling good about pricing going into 2019.","Matt Summerville","And then, David, can you comment when you look into fourth quarter specifically with EMG, what drove the year-over-year acceleration in organic performance against a double-digit comparison? And then, specifically can you also comment at what you're seeing with respect to the robotics and automation market specifically? Thank you.","Dave Zapico","Yes, robotics and automation was a driver of the EMG growth but it was more broad-based on that. I mean we had really solid growth in the military aerospace business and we also saw solid growth on our EMED business. So pretty much all components of the EMG were firing in all cylinders in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Allison Poliniak","Could you maybe give us a little bit more color on growth investments in 2019 I know obviously new product development there? Where else are you focusing your growth investment dollars for 2019 at this point?","Dave Zapico","Right, our growth investments, incremental growth investments for 2019 are up about 7% versus 2018 and we're going to invest incrementally about $80 million in growth investments and they're going to be across incremental sales opportunities, incremental marketing opportunities, and incremental engineering opportunities. And then they're in three buckets and they are probably about equally spread across those buckets.","Allison Poliniak","That's helpful. And then incremental operating leverage for 2019, anything we should be mindful of there that could maybe drive it outside of the normal for you?","Dave Zapico","We were -- we -- for 2018, we have excellent operating income margins, we had about 110 basis points of expansion ex-acquisitions and the core incrementals were about 35%. And we think about 2019 we're back to about 34, 30 to 40 basis points of operating income margin expansion and we're back to about the incrementals of 30% to 35%, there's really nothing driving that except there's -- we're going to see how the year gets started and but we feel good about the way the company is performing and the margin performance of the company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Christopher Glynn","Hey Dave, wondering about the $80 million in savings forecast similar to executed in 2019, you have been delivering that range as long as I've been covering you, just want to ask about the evergreen aspects of that, does that get more challenging at some point?","Dave Zapico","I don't think it does, Chris it is kind of in our D&A. I mean we go around to each of our businesses and we look at cost reductions as an element of our core operating environment and then there's always new acquisitions that come into the fold that provide some new opportunities. So I think we're solid for 2019. And when I look long-term, I think as long as we keep executing our strategy they will remain evergreen opportunities.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks for that. And in the outlook, I'm just curious if you're seeing any acceleration in aerospace clearly some peers are seeing that into that vertical and overall if there are other areas that are accelerating whereas notably stable or potentially some rollover?","Dave Zapico","Yes, I think our aerospace and defense businesses has had an outstanding fourth quarter. I mean a lot of it is what you see across other businesses. Our sales were up high teens on a percentage basis in the quarter and the growth was driven by very strong organic growth. Our organic growth was 10% on our aerospace business in the fourth quarter.","We had similar for the first three quarters a year, we continue to see solid and balanced growth across aerospace markets with notable strength across both commercial and military businesses and so we're feeling good about our aerospace business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Brett Linzey","Hey, just wanted to talk about the pace or pattern of activity through Q4 any, any major fluctuations between October and December and then how did January orders perform for the total company?","Dave Zapico","Yes, great question, Brett. Q4 played out like a typical Q4. We strengthened in the Q4 and December was our strongest month in terms of orders and sales. So that's pretty typical for us and we had a very strong December as we anticipated.","When you look at January recently completed our orders were right on plan. So we feel real good about January orders and then across the board, across all business, they came in on plan, so we feel good about that too.","Brett Linzey","Okay. And then just more and more housekeeping, what are you assuming for interest expense in 2019 given the heavy deal load in Q4 and are you assuming any deleveraging within that assumption? Thanks.","Dave Zapico","Yes, our interest expense is going to be up a bit for -- in 2019, up a little bit and what was the second question, Brett?","Brett Linzey","Just --","Dave Zapico","We have it. If you look at our debt profile, most of it is fixed debt with some balance on the revolver. So given the new private placement in December and the heavy acquisition and share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter, you'll see an increase probably upwards of close to 10% in interest expense year-over-year. And given that most everything of our debt is fixed, you'll see modest deleveraging as we pay down our revolver. But again that's really going to depend on the pace of acquisition activity as we go through the year or so. Our full expectation is we'll continue to be very active on the deal front and deleveraging won't be a factor.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray","Hey, I would like to start first with congratulations on the move to cash EPS but we all acknowledge it doesn't change the fundamentals but it certainly puts you on a level playing field with your acquisition line of competitors. What I also like seeing is that you guys are willing to adapt and be flexible, so maybe you can share with us a bit about the deliberation process internally, obviously you are at the beginning of the year would be the time to do it but any insight in to the focus internally on this?","Dave Zapico","Yes, it all comes down to our cash flow and we have strong cash flows or consistent cash flows and it's just another window into our financials that will allow our shareholders to better understand the strength of those cash generating capabilities. And as you said it aligns more comparably with our acquisitive peers. But it doesn't change how we're operating the business, it doesn't change how we're valuing deals, we always value deals on a cash basis anyhow.","So really it's additional information, a different window into the business that will provide our investors with that view. And we've got most people that we talk to want to go cash EPS, some a minority, were not fans of it, but net-net the aggregate it was a good decision for us because we didn't want to disadvantage everyone versus our peers.","Deane Dray","Great. And for the record we're big fans of the move, so we applaud that.","Dave Zapico","Thank you.","Deane Dray","And then second question is on CapEx. So $100 million, you did $82 million in 2018, that's a nice healthy 20% plus boost. And if we look around the multi industry sector that's probably going to be one of the higher if not the highest percentage increases. I think it's the first look we're seeing is closer to flat, so that speaks to your growth ambitions and confidence but can you share with us the thought about investing CapEx here at this rate and how committed are you to spend all of it and kind of -- what kind of returns are you expecting?","Dave Zapico","We're an asset-light business and we spend less than 2% of sales historically on CapEx and the $100 million ends up being about 1.9% of sales and they're really good projects across our businesses and it makes sense to fund them and they're all have excellent returns. So I think there is a commitment to do that and our businesses have good plans. So we're bigger business, we acquire some businesses, there is some investments that are needed to be made still within the context of being asset-light business and spending less than 2% of sales on capital.","Deane Dray","And do you look at those returns in comparison to the same thresholds on acquisitions what's the algorithm there?","Dave Zapico","Yes, usually the returns on internal CapEx are much higher. But there is a process that is a similar metrics on returns and they come bottom up from our businesses and we evaluate them during the budget process and that's where we ended up this year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Your line is now open.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning everyone. Can you hear me?","Dave Zapico","Yes, great.","Robert McCarthy","Great to be back and I must say, Brett, had asked a while very, very direct good question. So we're getting to the end of the bingo card here. But nevertheless just a couple of things, I mean I guess number one I know I've been out of it for a while but can you do the typical around the horn on organic growth across the segments and orders trends?","Dave Zapico","Sure, Rob, and we are glad to have you back and I will go around the horn. I talk about aerospace a little bit and so I will start with our process businesses and we finished the year with an excellent fourth quarter. The overall sales order were up mid teens driven by contributions from the acquisitions of SoundCom, Forza, Telular, and Spectro Scientific. Organic sales were up mid-single-digits in the quarter with particularly strong growth across our materials analysis business. And for 2019 we expect another solid year for our process businesses with organic sales expected to be at mid-single-digits.","Our automation and engineered solutions business has closed out the year with another excellent quarter with organic sales up high-single-digits in the fourth quarter. Our Dunkermotoren continues to deliver excellent results as their growth funnel is driving exciting new applications in precision motion control.","Additionally, as I mentioned before our engineered solution businesses are seeing continued solid demand across our key markets. And in 2019, we expect solid mid-single-digit organic growth across our automation and engineered solutions business.","And that brings me to power and industrial. Overall sales for power and industrial were up mid-single-digits driven by contributions from recent acquisitions of Arizona Instrument and Motec. Organic sales were down low-single-digits in the quarter against a difficult prior year comparison for our power instrumentation business.","And for 2019, we expect low-to-mid-single-digit of growth with balanced growth across our power and industrial. So if you look at our different market segments we are expecting mid-single for process, mid-single for aerospace, low-to-mid for power and industrial and mid-single for automation and engineered solutions.","Robert McCarthy","And just in that context, in the context of this question, how do you think about your oil and gas especially metals exposure for the quarter and then expectations for next year just break sense of that for us?","Dave Zapico","Yes, sure, Rob. In the fourth quarter, our oil and gas was up mid-single-digits, our upstream was up mid-teens and our mid and downstream was flat. It was precipitous decline and then a significant increase in the quarter; it really didn't impact business conditions much for us.","For all of 2019, we expect our oil and gas business to grow mid-single-digits, and we expect the upstream to be up high-single-digits, and mid and downstream to be up low-to-mid-single-digits, so moderating growth but still solid for our oil and gas businesses.","Robert McCarthy","And in specialty metals, I mean I didn't note for that.","Dave Zapico","Yes, metals business was up a bit higher than EMG. So EMG we had solid growth and specialty metals had a good quarter. And for 2019, we expect it to be in line with AMETEK growth, so we're seeing strong markets, the end markets there are aerospace, medical, specialized industrial so that business is doing well and we're expecting it to continue in 2019 at a somewhat moderating basis.","Robert McCarthy","If you both in one follow-up, a different question, looking at some of your ostensible comps in the public markets, real acquisition stories, they definitely have a narrative around how they buy companies and I think there's a narrative view of all not formally articulated but if you were to formally articulate how you go about buying companies and improving them, what would you focus on, would you focus on besides all being public and private multiples, I mean would you focus on R&D enhancement, would you focus on international expansion or global excellence procurement, what would -- how would you explain to someone how you're going to take a business and make it better on the SG&A gross margin front, working capital front and what is kind of your secret sauce for capital deployment and fundamentally making these businesses, selecting these businesses but then fundamentally making them better?","Dave Zapico","Right, Rob, in terms of selection, it really comes down to being in a near adjacency, I mean, our existing presence and we look for product differentiation, we look for service differentiation, that's the number one attribute. And in terms of how we add value to deals, we have a long track record of taking businesses that are 10% to 15% EBITDA and then doubling the margins and over the course of three to five years and really it's all of the above in terms of how we do it, we have seasoned operators that are very experienced in M&A and very experienced in improving the businesses. And we -- the playbook that we develop can be based on improving organic growth in terms of exporting global opportunities that can be based on improving gross margins by global sourcing, it can be based on reducing G&A, it can be -- there's a whole playbook and certainly pricing is one thing that we think we have some insight into these markets and know what price can be paid and what the customers are willing to pay.","So we do, we have a very well defined process, it results in custom playbooks for each business, we have excellent process capability and so, process capability across deal closing and across deal modeling, diligence and integration. And I think our secret sauce is our very strong business operators that are well ran in the AMETEK business system and they provide ownership for delivery of the financial metrics for each individual deal and none of that has changed. And we have a great class of businesses that joined AMETEK in 2018 and we are looking forward to improving them in 2019 and we also have a strong pipeline to looking at bringing into the company. So we feel very good about the M&A opportunities for AMETEK.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Andrew Obin","Just couple of questions from me, I was really surprised by your China growth number, very different I think from a lot of your competitors, can you just give us some more color as to what end markets are driving this strong performance?","Dave Zapico","Yes, I think the biggest market that's driving the strong performance are our process analytics instrumentation businesses and it's chiefly because their primary products allow customers to enhance their manufacturing capabilities. So as China moves up the value chain and wants to do more sophisticated manufacturing, our process businesses provide that capability through their instrumentation. So that's the primary reason that we've been doing so well in China. And as I said we think the growth is going to moderate but we still feel good about the market.","Andrew Obin","Sure. And then the follow-up question on M&A, and by the way just too concerned, when we say process that's manufacturing process not oil and gas process?","Dave Zapico","Yes.","Andrew Obin","Right. Okay. And just a question on M&A, have you guys changed how you guys source the deals because lot of companies sort of complain about the pricing availability, you guys still seem to be able to execute very well in the M&A pipeline, if you could give us some color on sourcing of your deals and evolution of your sourcing over the past couple of years? Thank you and a great quarter by the way.","Dave Zapico","Well, thank you, Andrew. Deal sourcing is a competitive advantage for AMETEK. We have in our niche presence is we dedicate resources to developing a pipeline of deals. So some of our deals come through the typical auction process but some of our deals are privately sourced by businesses that see how we operate in the niche markets that we're in. So and we have a dedicated we have about nine, nine or 10 M&A professionals, there's 10 actually, 10 M&A professionals who work closely with our businesses and they identify strategic acquisitions and we have people dedicated to the field to, so it's a business process, it's not just an event and that process allows us to build off an intangible asset of these pipeline of deals that we follow over years.","So we're looking to acquire them, they see how we operate and we're preferred buyers. So it's really a long-term commitment to the markets that we operate in and good knowledge about the targets and the pipeline, as I said, look so strong now as it did entering last year and last year we had a record year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Yes, just a follow-up on some of the other questions that have been asked. I guess first on some of the actions that we saw in the fourth quarter particularly the oil price dislocation, I think for a lot of folks who had brought up kind of the 2016, 2017 timeframe and some of the volatility you saw in the businesses back then just as a bit of a sanity check, can you remind us kind of how far off trough or maybe still how far away from prior peak some of those businesses are to -- give us some sensitivity around if we were to come into a more difficult macro scenario maybe there's not as much downside as there was back in that time frame?","Dave Zapico","Yes, sure, Josh. If we go back our oil and gas exposure was peak at about $400 million. And right now total exposure is about $290 million. So it's about 6% of the company and about $290 million, so we are still well off our peak and of our presence about one-third of that is U.S. and two-third of it is international and about 25% of it is upstream and 75% is mid and downstream. And what we're seeing in the markets pretty typical of oil and gas expansion, the upstream starts as you come out of a cycle and then it transitions to mid and downstream and we have a bigger mid and downstream presence.","So we're expecting the mid and downstream to pick up a little bit this year. So we're feeling pretty good about our oil and gas presence right now and we think we're well positioned.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it, that's helpful. And then a lot of questions on M&A during the call maybe one more from me, a lot of your peers that are kind of in the same category is as being near compounders and who have also moved to cash EPS, I think I've also tried to develop a bit more of a recurring revenue profile, I think any idea you probably touch more data than a lot of your peers or competitors out there, is there an ambition to maybe step up the recurring revenue side of that through something in the software space, is that something that you've looked at in the pipeline, something you've kind of considered strategically, just curious what are your thoughts on those?","Dave Zapico","It\u2019s a great question, if you look at the last two acquisitions we did with Telular and Spectro Scientific, there is both a recurring theme in both of those businesses that's tied to the software, this is tied to the data and it's -- I think with Telular we have about 65% recurring revenue and with Spectro about 25% recurring revenue. And in both cases they're dealing with information, they're dealing with algorithms; they are dealing with making the information and solving customer problems. So it's definitely a focus for us and we have a tremendous growing software capability, we've been investing in over many years we're about 150 engineers in India developing software for us in Bangalore. So we have a good internal capability and with our acquisition profile it's certainly something that we're looking at and the recurring nature is something that is key for us to grow in AMETEK.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Ken Newman","Hey, thanks for fitting me in. This is actually Ken Newman on for Steve. I just had a quick modeling question and I'm not sure if this has been covered already but you had really good flexibility to hedge some changes in FX this quarter, just curious is there any embedded expectations for the impact on foreign exchange to sales or margin within the guide?","Dave Zapico","Yes, for the full-year 2018 on the top-line FX was a benefit of about a point. But for 2019 the full-year FX is a negative 1%. And then when we move to the bottom-line, as we've communicated in the past we're largely naturally hedged at the profit line given the general balance of revenues and costs across currencies. So you won't see a meaningful impact either way on our profitable results from the FX movements, so that's how we model the year and that's been the history of how the business has resulted in operations.","Ken Newman","Got it. And then last one for me, you saw a pretty decent acceleration in the incremental margin for EMG, I think someone else touched on this a little bit before, is there any reason to believe that that could kind of revert back to the same type of incrementals as you saw in the last -- in the first half of 2018 or is this kind of run rate for incremental margin pretty, pretty solid for 2019?","Dave Zapico","Yes, we had a good year in 2018 and we had a good year in Q4, our incrementals were solid at 40%, with our EIG business around 50% and our EMG business around 30%. And then for 2019 we are expecting good solid incrementals but more in the 30% or 35% range.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is now open.","Richard Eastman","Dave, just kind of reading the body language here through -- your body language through all the responses and questions, as we guide the 3% to 5% core for 2019, I'm curious I mean the tone here is such that the businesses generally stay steady and strong but run up against the comps and so is that largely kind of how you're feeling about the business right now given the backlog, the orders is this -- is the 3% to 5% really kind of the comp issue more so than the tone of business in any of those segments?","Dave Zapico","Yes, I think that is an accurate representation of how we are feeling, Ric.","Richard Eastman","Yes, and like Dunkermotoren, I mean you commented how strong it was in the fourth quarter but I would think of that business as being maybe an early or cyclical kind of indicator, oil and gas maybe the same but no break in trend in those businesses all when you look out to 2019?","Dave Zapico","When you think about Dunkermotoren and think automation and the global macro trends and automation is really a secular trend. So Dunkermotoren is a really strong backlog and is performing exceptionally well.","And as I said with oil and gas, it's -- we are positioned now with larger mid and downstream presence to do quite well and that business is performing very well and we're quite a way from our peak so feeling pretty good about that.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Yes, and geographically the 3% to 5% they're pretty much spread across the three major regions in terms of an expectation for 2019?","Dave Zapico","Yes, that's pretty much maybe a little bit better growth in the U.S. but pretty much all geographies are growing at 3% to 5% range.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just last question this might be a little bit more difficult but when you look at AMETEK\u2019s mix of business on next 12 months basis, could you take a swing at what revenue is coming from call it maybe the medical and food exposure that we now have, I mean, it must be north of $0.5 billion, I would presume or --?","Dave Zapico","Yes, our medical exposure is about 13%, 14% of sales and you have to work with Kevin on the food exposure. I'm not a legal expert coming out. So that's combining our process businesses and actually shows up a little bit about in our automation businesses also. But it\u2019s a growing presence and but the medical, the healthcare business is about 13%, 14% of sales and it's performing well for us.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And just last question, in aerospace you may be provided this but in terms of 2019, what's the growth expectation for all of aerospace and do we still lead with commercial and military or as the BizJet piece of the business as a backlog they're built or how do we look at the four segments there against the 2019 forecast?","Dave Zapico","We are expecting growth in all four segments and our guide is positive mid-single-digit growth and we're still seeing strong business in the military and commercial side. So business jet is going to have a solid year but we think we are going to have more strength in commercial and military.","Operator","Thank you.

AMETEK had a strong fourth quarter to complete another outstanding year. We established quarterly and annual records for sales, operating income, operating margins, net income, diluted earnings per share, and operating cash flow. ","For the full year of 2011, sales were up 21%, operating income was 32%, margins were up 180 basis points, and diluted earnings per share ended at $2.37, a 35% increase over 2010.","Focusing on the fourth quarter, sales were up 13% to $762.8 million; internal growth was strong at 6%, while acquisitions added 7%. ","Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 24% to $167.4 million, from $135.5 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our operational excellence activities.","Operating income margin in the quarter was a record at 21.9%, a 190 basis points improvement over the fourth quarter of 2010. ","Net income was up 25% to $101.9 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were up 26% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Orders in the fourth quarter were $748 million, up 4% over a difficult comparison from the prior year. ","Operating cash flow was suburb with both the fourth quarter and full-year results representing records. Operating cash flow was $153 million for the quarter and $509 million for the year, up 19% and 20% respectively. Free cash flow was 132% of net income in the fourth quarter and 119% of net income for the full year.  ","Turning our attention to the individual operating groups; the Electronics Instrument group had a tremendous fourth quarter with strength across each of our major businesses. For the quarter, sales were up 17% to a record $441.5 million, on accelerating growth in our Aerospace business, and continuing strength in our process, tower, and industrial businesses. The Reichert technologies and EM Test acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter, also contributed to the growth. ","Internal growth was 9%, acquisitions added 8%, and foreign currency translation had no impact on EIG.","EIG\u2019s operating income increased 29% to $116.3 million, and operating margins were very strong at 26.3%, up 240 basis points over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Both operating income and operating margins in the quarter were records. ","The Electromechanical group also performed well in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Sales were up 7% to $321.3 million in the fourth quarter on strength in our differentiated businesses. In particular, our aerospace third-party MRO business was very strong. The acquisitions of Avicenna Technology and Coining, also contributed to the growth. ","Internal growth was 1%, acquisitions added 6%, and foreign currency had no impact.","EMG\u2019s operating income increased 6% to $62.3 million, and operating margins were 19.4%. ","Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company and our focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. ","Operational excellence has many facets within AMETEK, including lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back office operations, designed for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts, and the movement of production to low cost locales. ","We are especially pleased with our working capital results, which reached an all-time record level in the fourth quarter. Working capital as a percentage of sales was 17% in the quarter. We also continue to drive lower cost through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. From these sourcing activities, we recognized $8 million in savings of the fourth quarter, and $30 million in savings for all of 2011. ","For 2012, we expect approximately $40 million in incremental savings through our material cost reduction initiatives. All of these operational excellent efforts were key drivers in achieving record operating margin of 21.9% in the quarter, full-year margins were 21.3%, an all-time record for AMETEK and up 180 basis points from 2010.","Moving on to our second strategy, global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK\u2019s growth. ","In the fourth quarter of 2011, international sales represented 50% of our total sales. Due to the investments we\u2019ve made over the last several years, order growth in the BRIC locations was very strong, at 18% in the quarter and 35% for the full year. We have also seen continued growth in our global, oil, and gas business, as many new supply sources are being explored and developed.","In particular, the growth of the Canadian Oil Sands, as an attractive source for proven oil reserves, has led to a number of opportunities for our solid-state controls business unit. The latest order awarded was the UPS system contract for the Kearl Oil Sands in Alberta, Canada. The initial order was valued at $2.3 million with additional orders expected to follow. AMETEK\u2019s solid-state controls was previously awarded orders for the supply of industrial UPS equipment, totally over $6 million related to other Oil Sands projects in Canada.","AMETEK has devoted considerable resources to this growing market, including establishing a local service center, to further enhance our position and serve customers. We are well positioned to capture additional business and support of the development of the Oil Sands as the leading supplier of industrial UPS equipment in Canada.","In the fourth quarter, AMETEK\u2019s EM Test business booked their first order to supply compliance testing solutions into the hybrid and electric car market. This order is for the supply of a compliance test system, to test surge, harmonics and flicker for E-car charging stations. EM Test is in discussions with many of the leading automobile manufacturers, and expects similar orders to follow. ","As the hybrid and electric vehicle market develops, a set of compliance standards is emerging, which will require electric automobile manufacturers and charging stations to comply with electronic discharge and compatibility standards. ","REM Test business, which we acquired in October of 2011, is well positioned to capitalize on this niche market opportunity. EM Test is currently the clear leader in providing conductive immunity solutions to the automotive test industry, enabling car manufacturers and their supply chain, to ensure compliance to ISO standards. This opportunity is a great example of AMETEK\u2019s strategy to expand our existing capabilities into new market areas.","Moving on to our third strategy, new product development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We\u2019ve consistently invested in RD&E. In 2011, we spent $137 million, which was up 22% from 2010, and in 2012 we expect to spend $155 million, a 13% increase over 2011. ","And we\u2019re excited about some recent new product introductions. Our Vision Research business introduced a third generation of their Phantom Miro high-speed imaging camera line, the Miro M-Series. The Phantom Miro line is targeted at scientist and engineers for use in applied research applications, product development, and quality monitoring of high-speed processes. The new Miro M-Series delivers a price-to-performance ratio, which sets a new benchmark in the industry, in addition, it provides for a new level of performance and ease of use, which will open new segments of the market to high-speed imaging.","Our Medical Interconnects business recently received their first order for the supply of highly-engineered cables and cable harnesses, for use in portable medical imaging products. This order was received from Varian Medical Systems, an existing customer of our medical interconnect business. ","Demand for portable products, such as portable ultrasound and X-ray equipment, has increased through the improvements in imaging quality, along with the continued focus on reducing medical cost and improving access.","Our Medical Interconnects business is well positioned to capitalize on further opportunities in this developing niche market, given our strong technical and engineering capabilities, along with our excellent relationships with many of the key medical OEMs.","From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 21% of sales in the fourth quarter, up from 19% last year, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. ","Turning our attention to acquisitions, which is our core strategy, we had another tremendous year for acquisitions in 2011, and with the announcement this morning of the acquisition of O'Brien  Corporation, we started 2012 strong. I will discuss O'Brien in a moment, but first wanted to address our 2011 acquisitions. ","We deployed nearly $475 million in capital on five acquisitions in 2011, and acquired approximately $215 million in annual revenue. We acquired an excellent set of highly-differentiated businesses that expanded our market opportunities and technology base, in the areas of electrical interconnects, [inaudible], diagnostics, programmable power, and high-end and analytical instrumentation.","In the fourth quarter alone, we closed three acquisitions, Reichert Technologies, EM Test, and Technical Manufacturing Corporation. ","Over the last two years, we have deployed over $1 billion in capital on acquisitions, and acquired approximately $430 million in annual revenue. ","The last acquisition completed in 2011 was Technical Manufacturing Corporation, which we closed in December. TMC is a global leader in high-performance precision vibration isolation systems, for use in ultra-precision measurement applications, where vibration isolation is critical to accuracy. AMETEK has and will use these products in conjunction with our high-end metrology instrumentation. ","TMC was privately held and has annual sales of approximately $30 million. TMC\u2019s products include Piezoelectric vibration cancellation systems, which are based on TMC\u2019s patented active Piezo technology. They also provide passive vibration cancellation systems, optical test benches, and acoustic and magnetic isolation hoods. It\u2019s customers include the leading manufacturers of life sciences, botanics, and semiconductor equipment, along with testing laboratories and universities, where vibration isolation is critical to the quality of their testing work.","TMC is an excellent acquisition for AMETEK and fits well with our ultra-precision technology business, it\u2019s the leader in its market niche, and has unique differentiated technology. It also provides compelling market synergy opportunities across many of our high-end analytical instruments businesses, given the complementary nature of its product offering, and the common customer base.","Now, turning to the acquisition of O'Brien Corporation, which we announced this morning. ","O'Brien is a leading manufacturer of fluid and gas handling solutions, sample conditioning equipment, and process analyzers used in critical applications in the process industries worldwide. ","O'Brien was privately held and has annual sales of approximately $80 million. The price paid was approximately $175 million. O'Brien\u2019s product offering includes pre insulation tubing bundles, sample conditioning equipment, specialty electro polished tubing for use in high purity applications, instrument enclosures, and process analyzers. Its products are used to enable the capture, transport, and analyses of liquids, gases, vapors and emissions, in challenging process environments, such as oil and gas production, refining, petrochemical processing, power generation, pharmaceutical manufacturer, and semiconduction fabrication.","O'Brien\u2019s product lines are both highly differentiated and highly complementary to AMETEK\u2019s process instrument businesses, combined with our analytic instrument solutions, AMETEK can now offer its customers a complete solution for most of their process analysis needs. In addition, we expect to lever the strong customer relationships of the combined businesses and AMETEK\u2019s global capability, to further extend O'Brien\u2019s market reach.","Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2012 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our backlog of deals is excellent, our balance sheet is strong, and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. ","Turning now to the outlook for 2012. We expect our businesses to continue to show solid growth in 2012, with our longer-cycle, oil and gas, power and aerospace businesses showing particular strength. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence, capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2012.","We anticipate 2012 revenue to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis from 2011, organic growth is expected to be up mid-single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2012 are expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.70 per diluted share, up 12% to 14% over 2011, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth and our operational excellence initiatives.","First quarter of 2012 sales, are expected to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis from last year\u2019s first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.63 to $0.65 per diluted share, up 13% to 16% over last year\u2019s first quarter.","In summary, our overall businesses performed extremely well in the fourth quarter and in 2011, producing record results for essentially all key financial metric. We expect top and bottom-line growth to continue in 2012, as our longer cycle, higher profit businesses show particular strength, and the benefits of our 2011 acquisitions are fully realized. We have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. ","In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth. John, will now cover some of the financial details, and then we\u2019ll be glad to take your questions.","John Molinelli ","Thank you Frank. As Frank noted, we had a strong fourth quarter with excellent financial performance and a high quality of earnings. I will provide some further details. ","Core growth in selling expenses in the quarter was in line with growth in core sales. General and Administrative expenses were 1.5% of sales below last year\u2019s fourth quarter level of 1.9% of sales, driven primarily by lower consulting spend in this year\u2019s fourth quarter. ","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.7%, up from last year\u2019s fourth quarter rate of 29.4%. The full-year tax rate was 30.9% versus last year\u2019s rate of 30.1%, and in line with our expectations. ","For 2012, we would expect our tax rate to be between 30 and 31%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full-year rate.","On the balance sheet, working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables was 17% of sales in the fourth quarter, down from 18% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This record low level of working capital positions AMETEK as one of the top performers in our peer group, and is a direct reflection of the tremendous drives our business units have taken, in driving towards operational excellence.","Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital spending was $18 million for the quarter, and $51 million for the full-year. Full-year 2011 capital expenditures were 1.7% of sales. 2012 capital expenditures are expected to be about $60 million. ","Depreciation and amortization was $24 million for the quarter and $87 million for the full-year. 2012 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $100 million. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and full-year were records. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $153 million, up 19% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter, and full-year operating cash flow of $509 million was up 20% over 2010.","Free cash flow was $134 million for the fourth quarter, representing 132% of net income. For the full-year, free cash flow was $458 million approximately 119% of net income, continuing our strong free cash flow generation. Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy where we expended nearly $475 million on transactions in 2011. In addition, we repurchased $59 million in stock in 2011. ","Total debt was $1.26 billion at December 31, up $95 million from 2010 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalence of $170 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at December 31, of 34.8%, down from 36.2% at the end of 2010.","At December 31, we had approximately $915 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Subsequent to the end of 2011 we acquired O'Brien Corporation for approximately $175 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains to acquisitions. ","And in summary, we had an outstanding 2011 establishing records for essentially all the key financial metrics. We\u2019re well positioned for further growth, organically and through acquisitions with a strong balance sheet and cash flow.","That concludes our prepared remarks, we are now happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions).  Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Allison Poliniak \u2013 Wells Fargo","","Hi.  Good morning, guys. ","Frank Hermance","","Hi, Allison. ","Allison Poliniak \u2013 Wells Fargo","So, obviously, concerns about Europe and emerging market growth is certainly on the forefront of investor\u2019s minds.  Could you just give us a little color on what you\u2019re seeing geographically as well as how you\u2019re thinking about it going into 2012?  ","Frank Hermance","","Sure, Allison.  We saw a little impact of Europe in the fourth quarter.  It was predominately in our floor care motor business.  If you look at the organic growth numbers for the company at 6% overall, the organic growth in Europe was about 3% and the organic growth in Asia was about 9%.  And in the U.S., it was around 6%.  So Europe was a little weaker but you know, not significantly.  And probably, very importantly, our order intake so far in January has been nothing short of superb.  And Europe looks fairly good so I\u2019m not overly concerned at this point, but obviously, we are going to watch it very, very closely. And as you know, they\u2019re very aggressive if revenue starts to show weakness in terms of removing costs and keeping our profitability up.  So, so far, so good, but I would say some slight weakness in Europe.  ","Allison Poliniak \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great.  And also, obviously you guys have done a great job on margins in 2011 and historically.  How should we think about the margin profile going forward?  ","Frank Hermance","","Yeah, we believe that even though we\u2019ve hit record levels on margins, that there\u2019s definitely more runway.  I have consistently said through the course of 2011 to model about 30 basis points as we go forward and as we\u2019ve rolled up the budgets, we feel confident in another 30 basis points of improvement in 2012.  And it really comes from two places; first, with the organic growth that we\u2019ve talked about in 2012 of mid-single digits and with the contribution margins that we have, which are superb.  In the fourth quarter, our contribution margin was greater than the 40% so you take that organic growth with that kind of contribution margin and obviously that\u2019s going to be a positive impact on the overall margins in the company.  ","And secondly, as always, we will be aggressive on the cost reduction side.  In 2012, we\u2019re going to put approximately $60 million of cost improvements through the P&L.  So you take those two dynamics and it does lead to improving margins. ","Normally, what we do is give you some estimates at the beginning of the year and then the margins get better as we go through the year and I hope that will be the case this year.  So the 30 basis points is probably a conservative amount. ","Allison Poliniak \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great.  Thank you. ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Berry with UBS.  Please proceed with your question.  ","","Robert Berry \u2013 UBS","Hi, guys.  Good morning.  ","Frank Hermance","","Hi, Robert. ","Robert Berry \u2013 UBS","First on O'Brien, is there any assumed accretion this year from it?  ","Frank Hermance","","There\u2019s a cents of accretion that\u2019s in our estimates, but nothing substantial.  There will be costs that will run through the P&L as we integrate that business.  So the real effect on the bottom line will come more in 2013 than 2012. ","Robert Berry \u2013 UBS","Got you.  And then you called out areas of strength; Aerospace and also Oil and Gas.  I was wondering if you could just unpack each of those a little bit for us in terms of what your outlook is in the various areas within Aero and also within Oil and Gas, particularly up versus downstream.  Thanks. ","Frank Hermance","","Sure, Robert.  I would be glad to do that.  Why don\u2019t I start with our overall Aerospace business.  That business completed a solid year with high single digit organic growth in the fourth quarter and it was on strengths in the third-party MRO business, the commercial businesses.  We expect to really see strong growth for all of Aerospace in 2012 and that\u2019s going to be based on the OEM build rates.  ","If you look at Boeing, they\u2019re projecting to be up about 18% on build rates.  Airbus is expected to be up about 9%.  So overall, we\u2019re looking at 13% build rate in the 2012 timeframe.  And also, revenue passenger miles support strong growth. ","And our business and regional jet business as well, is expected to do very well.  But that\u2019s mainly due to program wins on new aircraft, not as much by market as it is by the engineering efforts we\u2019ve put in place.  ","So to give you some specifics on the various segments, in 2012 we expect our commercial and third-party MRO businesses will be high-single digits.  Our business and regional jet business, we actually expect to be up low-double digits, so it\u2019s going to be actually our strongest growth area.  And our military business is expected to be up low-single digits.  ","So when you sum all of that up, we expect our overall Aerospace business should be up in that mid-to-high single digits region in 2012.  And as I mentioned, our orders look really good in January and Aerospace is one of the drivers for that.  ","Talking about the process businesses and oil and gas, I\u2019ll talk first about the process businesses overall and then I\u2019ll come back to address your upstream, midstream, downstream question.  ","The process markets performed extremely well in Q4, both in the quarter and the full year, with strong growth across most of the business in process.  In the quarter, our growth was driven by oil and gas, ultra-precision technology and our advanced measurement technology businesses.  So it\u2019s broader than oil and gas, although oil and gas was a key driver.  ","Sales were up high-single digits organically in the quarter and high-teens overall.  And if you look to 2012, we expect this business to grow high teens overall with organic growth of mid-single digits.  ","And if you look at the later cycle oil and gas businesses, that is going to be a driver for this.  ","So if you look at the various segments of upstream versus midstream versus downstream. The growth is clearly being driven more by upstream than it is by midstream or downstream. However, the midstream business is still reasonably good and if you look at the downstream business, outside of the U.S. and about 70% of our process businesses are outside the U.S. it\u2019s pretty good.  This has been a driver to the company in 2011 and we expect it to do extremely well in 2012.  ","Robert Berry \u2013 UBS","Great. Thank you very much. ","Frank Hermance","","Sure. ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.  ","Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Thanks, good morning, guys.  ","Frank Hermance","","Hello, Jim. ","Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Frist a housekeeping question. John, the payables number? ","John Molinelli","","Sure, Jim; $283 million. ","Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Great, thanks a lot.  And Frank, first question.  With regards to the EMG core of 1% in the fourth quarter, could you walk us through the dynamic there given the commentary about the Aerospace and differentiated businesses?  Just what was the dynamic behind the slower core in the fourth quarter in EMG? ","Frank Hermance","","Yeah, sure, Jim.  Basically, the driver there was Europe, as I mentioned and it was predominately in the floor care and motor business.  That particular business was weaker than we had anticipated.  It was down about mid-single digits and we were forecasting more flattish for that particular business.  So that had an impact on the organic growth in that portion of our business.  ","But the good news is that January is starting off quite strong.  So it\u2019s actually a bit hard for us to understand exactly what happened.  It was really at the end of the fourth quarter, it just looked like things slowed, but then it popped back.  So we\u2019re going to watch that closely, but that was the key driver and the answer to your question.  ","Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay, so the other components of EMG were in line or better than your forecast? ","Frank Hermance","","Yeah, they were fine.  The other components were fine.  ","Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay.  And you know, just a follow up on the emerging market question; you\u2019ve, you know, made a lot of investments there through the years.  Could you just give us an update of what you\u2019re seeing in the three key emerging markets of China, India and Brazil going into 2012?  ","Frank Hermance","","Yeah, I mean, the BRIC countries in general look very exciting to  us.  I know there\u2019s been a lot of talk in the press about slowing growth rates in those countries.  But our market shares are low and all those countries are doing well for us.  Overall, for the BRIC countries in 2012, we\u2019re looking at approximately 20% growth for the company.  So they will be a key driver.  Actually, it\u2019s 22% is the actual way that our budget is rolled up.  So they\u2019re going to be a driver to our growth. ","If you\u2019ll look at our concentration, it\u2019s heavily China.  That market continues to do well for us.  India, we\u2019ve made some major investments over the course of the last three or four years.  We saw excellent growth in 2011 and we expect that to continue in 2012.  If you look at Brazil, we don\u2019t have as much volume in Brazil, but we have decided to put significant investments in Brazil.  We feel that, you know, we\u2019ve been working in China for many, many years.  We\u2019ve done a lot in India, so our intention now is focused more in Brazil.  ","I may have mentioned in our last conference call, Jim, that we know have a 140,000 square foot facility in Brazil.  We\u2019ve won some major business with PetroBrass, which we\u2019re going to produce in that facility.  We\u2019ve opened it up now to the other AMETEK divisions, that they can put production down there.  We\u2019ve got the infrastructure to support that and our businesses are looking at it as aggressively as they have in China, for instance.  It\u2019s very unfortunate to be able to manufacturer in Brazil because of the terror situations that are a factor in that business.  ","And in that plant, we\u2019re also going to beef up our distribution capabilities.  We\u2019re going to have our divisions as we have in China and in India, put people down there in all of these BRIC countries.  If my recollection is correct, we\u2019re going to add just under 60 people that are predominately in the distribution network, a few in engineering in India just to continue that growth profile. ","So we\u2019re pretty encouraged with all of the BRIC countries and we think it\u2019s going to be a key driver to our gross, so we\u2019re going to continue those investments. ","Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay, great.  Thank you very much.  ","Frank Hermance. ","","You bet.  ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Frank Hermance","","Scott, are you there? ","Operator","","Mr. Graham, go ahead, your line is open. ","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Can you hear me? ","Frank Hermance","","Now we can, Scott.  ","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Fine, I\u2019m sorry, I had my mute on.  Good morning, all three of you.  ","John Molinelli","","Hi, Scott. ","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Company","So from what I heard you say, Frank, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I think you said fourth quarter organic orders were up 4, is that right? ","Frank Hermance","","That\u2019s correct.  \u201912 overall orders are up four.  And organic\u2026","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Would you be able to split that between the two segments? ","Frank Hermance","","Actually, I don\u2019t have that information here, so I can\u2019t split it.  We don\u2019t look at orders as fundamentally the key drivers, Scott, because Aerospace orders just come in in lumps and actually, I don\u2019t have that data here.  So we can get it for you. ","John Molinelli","","We\u2019ll get it for you. ","Frank Hermance","","We\u2019ll get it for you, Scott. ","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Yeah, no, but [inaudible] cycle is always lumpy, I get that.  But was there anything, you mentioned that there were tough comps and you\u2019re kind of talking about the floor care.  Was there any other businesses that maybe contributed to that number maybe being a little bit below what we have seen?  ","Frank Hermance","","Not really.  There was maybe a little weakness in our TMC business, which is the higher technology and motors that are more in the differentiated segment.  But again, those orders came back very good in January.  So I would just say it was sort of the even flow, not anything that would be any different than sort of a normal recovery because we\u2019re coming back from sort of a recession.  We\u2019ve had huge organic growth over the course of the last year and now we\u2019re coming back to what I would call more normality.  So there is some movement up and down. But we\u2019re fairly encouraged right now.  We think 2012 is going to be a fine year.  ","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Yes.  I definitely sense that you know, my sense is that you\u2019re sensing that the fourth quarter 4% was just something more of lumpiness more than anything else.  I don\u2019t want to paraphrase here, but that\u2019s\u2026 ","Frank Hermance","","That\u2019s true. ","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Company","And then if you wouldn\u2019t mind, maybe going through some of the other businesses, you know, power, industrial and is there anyway, would you mind, if you could do this, great, to split kind of floor care versus technical versus EIG on the fourth quarter organic?  ","Frank Hermance","","Yeah, let me talk to your question in a way that I typically talk about the various subsegments in the business.  Looking at EIG, I think we\u2019ve handled Aerospace and we\u2019ve handled the process businesses.  So the one remaining part of EIG is the power and industrial and that business was very strong in Q4, sales were up low-teens organically and more than 20% overall, with excellent growth across both the power and the industrial parts of the business.  So strength really across that whole subsegment.  ","Looking forward in 2012, we expect sales for power and industrial to be up low-teens overall and mid-single digits organically.  So if you sum what we talked about for Aerospace, for process and for power and industrial, for all of EIG, we\u2019re expecting sales to be up about mid-teens overall and organically to be up mid-single digits.  And hopefully, that mid-single digit organic is a conservative number.  We\u2019ll see how that goes as the year unfolds.  ","Moving to the other half of the company where we really talk about this in two subsegments, the differentiated EMG businesses and our cost-driven motor business, for the differentiated EMG businesses, overall sales were up about 10% in Q4, a solid growth in the third party MRO business and obviously, we had contributions from acquisitions, which were out of [inaudible] Technology and coining, which helped to drive that business.  ","And looking into 2012, we\u2019d expect this business to be up again about 10% and organic growth in the mid-single digit arena.  So you know the business is doing very good and we expect it\u2019s going to continue.  ","The cost-driven motor business, which is the other piece of EMG, was weak in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned.  Q4 sales were down mid-single digits, which was weaker than we had anticipated, primarily due to Europe.  And for 2012, we expect this business to be up low-to-mid-single digits and you know, the January orders support that growth. ","So if you sum those parts of EMG, for all of EMG we\u2019re expecting a high-single digit growth in 2012 and organic growth of mid-single digits.  And the last thing I commented is, if you then look at both halves of the business and sum them up, as I'm mentioned in my overall talk , we\u2019re expecting low-double digits sales growth.  We\u2019re expecting another just fine year from a sales growth picture with organic growth in that mid-single digit arena.  ","So that gives you some color. ","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Company","That gives a lot of color, Frank.  Thank you.  My last question is this.  Do you have a specific FX impact within your budget, you know, is it, are you expecting minus 1, 2, 3?  Is there, you know something that you can offer on that? ","Frank Hermance","","On what, on pricing? ","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Company","On FX. ","Frank Hermance","On FX.  Probably as we go into 2012, about a point of negative headwind.  ","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Thanks very much. ","Frank Hermance","","Okay.  ","Operator","","Our next questions come from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer\t ","","Thank you, good morning.  ","Frank Hermance","","Morning, Chris.","","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer\t","","I have a question on what the price was in the quarter and your 2012 outlook, and just overall update and complexion on how you view your pricing power in the portfolio.  ","Frank Hermance","","Yes, basically in the 4th quarter our price end was up about 2 points and we have rolling in our - word it this way, we asked our divisions to get 2% in terms of pricing.  While we rolled through our budgets and what's in the forecast we gave you is 1 point.  And obviously, we're hoping that will be conservative, but that's the way we gave the estimates.  ","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer\t","","Okay, and then just interested in a little more detail on the globalizing opportunity for the two recent deals of O'Brien and TMC as now part of AMETEK.  And more broadly, how much of a role did those strategies play in 2011?  Do you think with realizing synergies with your global channels and recent acquisitions?  ","Frank Hermance","","Yeah, it's a huge factor Chris, and an excellent question.  If you look at the two acquisitions that I talked about this morning in detail, TMC and O'Brien, both of those businesses have about 70% of their volume in the US.  And that's an advantage of buying companies of the relative size that we buy in that they don't have as a significant amount of international exposure because it's expensive, and for a small company to put the infrastructure in is typical.  So we put infrastructure in place for our acquisitions so that in essence that can come right out on day 1 and simply put people in our infrastructure, those people report back to the acquired business.  But we have the - we know how to pay those people, we've got the legal structures set up, we got the facilities, etcetera.  So it's very, very easy for those acquired companies to immediately gain access to distribution in China, distribution in India, shortly we'll have that capability in Brazil, as I talked about.  And we have that capability in Europe as well.  So it's definitely a sizable factor when we think about deals, and especially businesses like O'Brien for instance, where the market opportunity outside the US is huge for that business.  As I mentioned for our profit businesses, about 70% of our volume is outside the US and that where a sizable amount of growth comes.  So we're going to capitalize on that.  We've set that company up in a way to capitalize on it, and we're pretty excited about it.  ","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer\t","","Okay, thanks.  And then last one, just some clarification.  You noted the 60 million cost savings in the plan, is that sort of a gross number that that's against natural inflation and it all kind of rolls up into the leverage targets?","Frank Hermance","","That's exactly right Chris.  Basically that 60 million is just the cost that we're taking out of the business and pricing is going to be a positive, and then on the other side of the, sort of, the balance sheet there's going to be inflation, and there's going to be investments.  And I can give you a rough flavor that on the investment side we plan to put in about $37 million in 2012.  And so we sum all of that up with the contribution margins of the company and that's in essence how we get to the bottom line in the estimates that you're talking about.  So it is a gross cost number when we speak to it.  Another measure, just to go a bit further on your question is we do look internally at just cost minus - excuse me, price minus inflation.  Just that's another measure and I have some numbers in the 4th quarter.  Price minus inflation was 0.8% of sales.  And the budgets are rolling up in that same region -  in that same kind of region.  So\u2026","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer\t","","Great, thanks Frank.  ","Frank Hermance\t","","Hey, you bet.","Operator","","The next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.  Please proceed.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","","Good morning gentlemen.  ","Male","","Morning Mark.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research\t","","So Frank, that 60 million in gross savings, that's including the 40 million of your global sourcing initiatives?","Frank Hermance\t","","That's correct.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research\t","","Okay, and the additional 20 is just kind of operational improvements?","Frank Hermance","","Yeah, it's operational improvements.  It would include a few plant consolidations that we're going to do.  And, you know, netted in that number is any cost associated with any restructuring that is going on.  So that's sort of a net number on the cost improvements going through the P&L, but it doesn't include inflation.  And it doesn't include other investments that we're making.  ","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research\t","","Okay, great.  And then can you bridge the EPS in 2012 for us?  How much volumes, acquisitions, and then I guess you talked about operational improvements.  Is there a way to break it out that way?","Male","","Boy, that's a very tough question, John do you have any thoughts on that?","John Molinelli","No, I don't.  I think - I think when you get the EPS you're getting into tax effect, some of these things.  That's really not how we break down the - how we look at the businesses Mark.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","","Okay.  In talking about BRIC countries, what were their percentage of sales in 2011?","Frank Hermance","","About 11% of our total sales are in the BRIC countries.  ","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","","11%, okay.  And then, I guess, finally when you talk about process, how big was that in '11?  And then, on the oil and gas side, how much are you tied to the fracking, natural gas phenomenon going on, particularly in the US?  And then, are you seeing potential pullbacks in investments with the slide in the natural gas prices?  Is that some chatter going on?  Assuming you're tied to that market.  ","Male","","This segment was on the order of $1 billion.  That whole process business, and if you break it down, about 1\/3 of that is in oil and gas.  About 25% is related to the metals industry, where we do analytic instrumentation in metals.  About 20% is in what we would call research and development.  And the remaining, whatever it is, 22% I think, is basically in varied industries.  So within that 1\/3 that is oil and gas, there's roughly an equal component of oil and gas in that 1\/3 of the business.  And though, to date although that's being under $3, which is incredibly low, and there's a lot of talk about some reductions in drilling, if you actually look at the data the recount in Q4 actually reached a higher level than it was back in 2008.  There's about, I think it's 3700 active rigs that are working at the present time.  So there could be some impact in the fracking area.  I did see an article where Chesapeake is discussing, or has actually decided that they're going to cut back some drilling.  But oil is doing just fine.  So it's pretty strong. I mean, it's pretty good.  ","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","","Okay, thank you. ","Male","","Yeah, just another point.  Bill dropped me a note, that is correct, that I should have mentioned.  Remember 70% of our business is outside the US as well.  So again, you're not going to have that major an impact even if the fracking goes down a bit in the US.  ","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","","Thank you.  ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","","Hi, good morning.","Male","","Good morning.  ","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","","I think you touched both the BRICs and the growth you're expecting out of those regions in '12.  You know, 20% plus and I think you said it was in the high teens in the 4th quarter.  Just wondering, you do have some difficult comps coming up in the 1st through the 3rd quarter, just wondering how to think about where you see that growth coming from and your confidence level there.  ","Frank Hermance\t","","Got pretty high confidence in the 1st two quarters of the year.  You know, it's not as clear in the 2nd half of the year, but we've got excellent backlog, it's over $900 million.  Aerospace is just accelerating, so we're very excited about it.  And if you look at the profit margins in aerospace and process and in the power industry of businesses, they have very high contribution margins.  So we've got, I would say significant confidence in the 1st half of the year.  And we've been a bit conservative on our estimates for the full year, and it's really based on it's not as clear in the 2nd half.  And so we want to watch that and although I don't think Europe is going to crash, if it did obviously that's going to have an impact on us in the 2nd half.  So we don't want to be too aggressive at this point. But I think the fundamental answer to your question is we've got a high confidence in the 1st half of the year.  ","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","","Okay, that's helpful.  Thanks.  And on the EMG side, the margin's down a touch from last year, is that really just the drag from the cost driven motor [Inaudible]?","Frank Hermance\t","","Yeah, there's a drag there.  I mean, we were, I think, 20 basis points, but still the margins are darn good at just under 20% - 19.4% in a quarter.  So we feel pretty good about that.  ","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","","Right, thanks.  And then, just lastly, on the M&A side what areas is the deal pipeline weighted today?","Frank Hermance","","Well first of all, the deal pipeline is just great.  We've obviously been very successful over the course of the last 15 months.  And not only buying companies, but in buying good companies that are really close adjacencies to what we do.  And we can leverage those companies in terms of increasing their reach, etcetera.  And the backlog really has deals in all of the major areas.  We'll acquire in aerospace, we'll acquire in the process businesses, we'll acquire in the power part of our business, and also in the differentiated part of the EMG.  The only part of the company that we don't intend to do any acquisitions is in the floor care and sort of cost driven part of EMGs.  So it's hard to predict where the deals are actually going to come from as we take each deal and sort of wrestle it to the ground, but I think you could assume we're going to do the kind of deals we've done over the last 15 months.  And we did for instance, Avicenna and Coining rolled up in EMG.  Reichert, TMC, and EM Test rolled up in EIG, so you had three in one part of the company and two in the other.  And O'Brien this morning, the first one out of the box is going to be in EIG.  And I can also tell you that we're working on another good sized deal in the EMG side of the business.  So I'm not specifically answering your question because it's varied, but there's lots of opportunity.  ","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","","Great. No, that's helpful.  I appreciate it, thank you.  ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Keybanc.  Please proceed with your question.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Morning.  Just a couple questions.  Frank, you had indicated I think, I your remarks that you expected the military side of aerospace to still be up in the low single digits in '12.  What was it in '11?  And I guess, what sort of gives you the confidence in that viewpoint just given everything that's going on with that?","Frank Hermance","","Right, well it's about the same.  It was in that low single digit kind of arena in 2011.  And we feel that even with some of the reductions - I know there's going to be some more color on that today.  There was a little bit in the Wall Street Journal.  But if you look at what they're doing, and like this morning they were talking about increasing the number of drones by about 30% due to the success we've had, and obviously we've got content on drones.  So I think the two drivers for us are that the electronic content in military either ground based vehicles or aerocraft is going up and we are the prime provider to the military of cooling solutions for those electronics.  So even if the overall military budget is going to wane some we believe we can and we\u2019ve shown that we can outgrow that.  So we think positively about that.  The other side is an EIG more is that we've invested very heavily in helicopters and they have to change this fleet to a more helicopter base fleet.  Just this recent situation in Somalia, they - using aircraft to parachute the SEALs in and then using helicopters to get them back out.  And so those investments also are going to sort of outgrow the military budget.  So, you know, and we've got pretty good visibility is this business so we think that low single digit rate is reasonable.  I guess, if we wanted to look at it negatively, I'm saying the overall aerospace is going to grow in that mid to high single digits.  If we didn't have the drag of military at low single digits we'd be probably up in double digits.  So it's not all good, but we also don't feel that there's a major problem there.  So I hope that helps Matt.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Yeah, that does.  And then just another question on the aerospace side of business.  Could you maybe differentiate a little bit between what your expectations are for 3rd party MRO growth versus sort of the traditional civilian aftermarket related piece?  And I guess, how much is share gain playing a role in your outlook there?","Frank Hermance","","Actually if we look at the 3rd party MRO business, we're saying that's going to be up, high single digits.  And we're also saying that commercial aviation is going to be up high single digits.  Now, for that 3rd part MRO piece, the market is estimated to be up about 4%.  Just to put a flavor on it, and therefore, a good part of the remainder is share gain.  There is some price in there, but a good part of it is in essence share gain.  If you look at the commercial side, that is more driven by the OEM production and just taking advantage of the market conditions.  As I mentioned Boeing and Airbus combined are going to be up 13% in build rates.  And obviously, we have to lead them because they need our parts to build their airplanes.  And that's why as we went into the 2nd half of last year we saw this accelerating growth.  So that's less share gain than it is market.  Does that help?","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets\t","","Thank you, Frank.  Yes, absolutely.  Thank you.  ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Elana Wood of Bank of America.  Please proceed with your question.  ","Elana Wood - Bank of America","","Good morning everybody.  ","Frank Hermance","","Hello, Elana.  ","Elana Wood - Bank of America","","Wondering if you've calculated incremental margins as acquisitions for the 4th quarter?  ","Frank Hermance","","We did.  They were superb.  They were in excess of 40%.  ","Elana Wood - Bank of America","","Okay, and I was just wondering, what is your kind of baseline assumption for the total company this year in terms of organic growth in Europe?","Frank Hermance","","It's about the same number we talked about in the 3rd quarter.  It's like a 3% kind of number, a little bit less than the US, for instance.  And it's significantly less than Asia.  ","Elana Wood - Bank of America","","Okay, do you see it dipping into negative territory in the 1st quarter or do you expect it to stay positive?","Frank Hermance","","Oh no, we expect it to remain positive.  I think the growth there, where we're very strong is in the process businesses.  And I think we're going to be just fine.  ","Elana Wood - Bank of America","","Okay, and then just circling back on the acquisition - the O'Brien acquisition, what was the purchase price multiple on EBITDA, in terms of EBITDA?","Frank Hermance","","The multiple on that deal was about 9 times trailing.  On the TMC deal it was about 6 \u00bd times trailing.  So actually that was good news to me that we're starting to see some better deals out there - a little bit more reasonable multiples.  ","Elana Wood - Bank of America","","Okay, and then just lastly, I was just wondering if there was any unusual items in your 2012 guidance?  How much tension is embedded in the guidance?  I know\u2026","Frank Hermance","","Yeah, we\u2019re in good shape.  I'll let John answer that question.  ","John Molinelli","","Yeah Elana, we are - well first of all we're overfunded on our prominent part of our pension numbers.  We're looking at probably about a $0.03 headwind going into 2012 if you just look at the pension.  But we\u2019ve got a couple other accounts, the restricted stock invested in 2011, obviously that expense won't - is not part of our 2012 outlook.  That's a couple cent to the good, so if you put a couple of those types of things together it's sort of a push, maybe a little bit, slight headwind, but it's just not significant at all.  So we really don't see that as an overall distraction from running the business.  ","Elana Wood - Bank of America","","Okay, terrific.  Thank you so much.  ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird and Company.  Please proceed with your question.            ","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","","Thanks.  Just two questions.  Frank, I was doing the math here on the backlog and I think you eluded to this, is the back log up around 912?  Something like that?","Frank Hermance","","Yeah, you got it.  It's 911 million.  It's up about $83 million since the beginning of last year.  ","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","","So about 10% year over year.  And then is that - would you think of aerospace and maybe process those, you know, maybe a little longer cycle businesses, would their backlog be up greater than that?  Is that where there's some confidence coming from?","Frank Hermance ","Yeah, yeah.  No, I think if you look at the breakdown of that backlog it does have a higher component of the longer cycle businesses and therefore, you couple that with the fact that the orders have been - you know, even the first part of this year, have started very strong, we just feel pretty confident in the short-term outlook, the six month outlook.  So even if we have some weakness in other parts of the business we feel our estimates will more than cover that.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","","Yes, okay.  And then just - I wanted to just double back for a second on the geographic thoughts for '12.  We're expecting some modest Europe growth and then I presume for '12 if we think US and Asia, or rest of the world, we're probably in these same general growth rates that we saw on the 4th quarter?","Frank Hermance","","Yeah, that's exactly right.  I mean, we're saying mid-single digits for the company a little bit weaker in Europe, stronger, much stronger in other parts of the world, but they are a smaller part of the business.  So that's where you sum up to this sort of mid 6% kind of number.  ","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","","And is the BRIC waiting - the sales waiting that goes into the BRIC countries, is that toward - it sounds like it's towards the process, maybe aerospace, but is - which businesses do you BRIC exposure weight towards?","Frank Hermance","","They weight towards the process businesses and there's definitely an aerospace component, but process is a key driver.  And it's because of the international markets that we've talked about, with oil and gas, and those kinds of businesses being largely outside the US.  Our metrology businesses are very strong in China.  So those businesses - and Russia as well, our process businesses are the strongest in Russia.  So those are the drivers for the growth and we feel pretty good about that.  ","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","","And there's no general degradation in incremental margins on process instrument sales into those emerging markets?","Frank Hermance","","No, absolutely not.  Matter of fact, we've looked at this very, very, closely during our strategic planning activities.  And if you roll up and look at the bottom line profits in the BRIC countries,  as a percentage of sales, versus the rest of AMETEK they're almost identical, less than a point difference.  And in the BRIC countries they're actually higher.  ","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","","Okay, very good, great.  Thank you, very nice quarter.  ","Frank Hermance","","Thank you Richard.  ","Operator","","(Operator Instructions)  And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.  Please proceed with your question.  Go ahead, your line is open.  ","Scott Graham - Jefferies","","Yeah, I'm having trouble with my mute button here, and I'm sorry for that.","Frank Hermance","","We'll get you a new mute button Scott.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","","You know, budgets are tight on the self-side so - you know, the 4% - I'm sorry to ask you about this question again, but the 4% orders number for the 4th quarter, Frank was that a total number or was it an organic?","Frank Hermance","","That was a total number and our organic was slightly less than that.  ","Scott Graham - Jefferies","","So the organic was slightly less than that.  If I factor in that BRICs was a real good number, you know, it would be fair to say then that sort of US\/Europe was flat to only slightly up, fair?","Frank Hermance","","You're talking about orders now or are you  talking about sales?","Scott Graham - Jefferies","","Orders, organic orders.","Frank Hermance","","Yeah, that's right.  I think that's right Scott.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","","Okay, then on that, let me just - the next question that stems is, you've got an outlook of let's say plus 3% in organic Europe, I was just wondering kind of what businesses would you expect to contribute to that 3?","Frank Hermance","","Oh, it's really a similar answer to Richard's question in that's it's predominantly going to be the process businesses.  And, you know, they are, one thing you also have to realize is that we roll up the Middle East and we roll up Russia in that part of the world  And the process businesses are doing very, very well.  So they will be a key driver.  And also, we have sizeable aerospace content.  We have a major company, actually several companies in Europe that service that part of the world and aerospace is doing fine in Europe.  So you take those two factors and you say okay, maybe floor care is not going to be as good and we feel, we're pretty comfortable with these numbers.  Matter of fact, it would not surprise me if we even exceeded this guidance that I'm giving you.  ","Scott Graham - Jefferies","","That's very helpful, thanks a lot.  ","Frank Hermance","","Okay, Scott.","Operator","","And there appear to be no further questions at this time.  Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.

","We will begin today with some prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions.","I will now turn the meeting over to Frank.","Frank S. Hermance","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had an excellent first quarter. We established quarterly records for orders, sales, operating income -- operating margins, net income and diluted earnings per share. ","Sales in the first quarter were up 15% to $827.2 million. Internal growth was strong at 6%, while acquisitions added 10% and currency was a 1% headwind. ","Operating income for the first quarter was superb. It increased 20% to $182.8 million from $152 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our Operational Excellence initiatives. Operating income margin in the quarter was a record at 22.1%, a 90-basis-point improvement over the first quarter of 2011. Net income was up 22% to $110.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.68 were up 21% over last year's first quarter. ","Orders in the first quarter were a record $863 million, up 8% overall from the prior year. Sequentially, orders were up 15%. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.04. ","Cash flow was very strong. Operating cash flow was $141 million, up 36% over last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was $132 million, or 120% of net income. Working capital management was excellent. Operating working capital was 17.2% of sales. ","Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a great first quarter. Sales were up 21% to a record $468.8 million on strength in our Aerospace and Process businesses. In addition, we had strong contributions from the 4 acquisitions that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and in January of 2012. Internal growth was strong at 9%, while currency reduced sales by 1%. EIG's operating income increased 23% to a record $123 million, and operating margins were a very strong at 26.2%, up 50 basis points over last year's first quarter. ","The Electromechanical Group also had a very good quarter. Sales were up 9% to $358.3 million on strength in our differentiated businesses and the contributions from the acquisitions of Avicenna and Coining. Internal growth was 3%. Acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency reduced sales by 1%. EMG's operating income increased 13% to $70.9 million, a record level, and operating margins increased 70 basis points to 19.8%. ","Focusing now on our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and acquisitions. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our focus on costs and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. Operational Excellence has many facets within our company, including lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back office operations, design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts and a movement of production to low-cost locales. We also continued to drive lower costs through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. From these sourcing activities, we recognized approximately $10 million in savings in the first quarter and are conservatively estimating $40 million in savings for all of 2012. Our continued focus on these Operational Excellence efforts were key drivers in achieving the record operating margin of 22.1% in the first quarter. ","Global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK's growth. In the first quarter of 2012, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. Organic growth in Asia was very strong in the first quarter, up mid-teens on a percentage basis over the first quarter of 2011. Growth in Europe was also strong, up mid-single digits organically in the quarter. Sales growth in the BRIC regions was excellent, at 20%, reflecting the impact from the investments we've made over the last several years. ","As an example of global and market expansion, AMETEK's Power Instruments business was recently awarded a contract to provide fault recorders and distributed alarm management systems to a high-speed rail project in Saudi Arabia. Our products will provide complete transient disturbance, trend and alarm management of all substation events, providing realtime indications of issues and high-resolution postmortem analysis in the event of a fault. The initial contract is for support of the first 2 phases of this rail project. We expect more orders to follow in additional phases. The total expected value for this project is approximately $3.5 million. ","New product development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We've consistently invested in RD&E. In 2012, we expect to spend $155 million, a 13% increase over 2011. We're excited about some recent new program wins driven by our R&D efforts and engineering capabilities. AMETEK Aerospace and Defense has been selected by Snecma to provide heat exchangers and sensors for the LEAP-1A and leap-1C engines being developed for the Airbus A320neo and the COMAC C919 -- that's a Chinese aircraft. AMETEK Hughes Treitler will supply low drag surface coolers to cool variable frequency generator oil and also main engine oil, while AMETEK Measurement and Power Systems will supply the sensors for these engines. The combined contract value is estimated to exceed $175 million over the life of the program. These awards are great examples of AMETEK's success in winning additional content on key aerospace growth platforms through our engineering capabilities. ","From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 19% of sales in the first quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. ","Turning our attention to acquisitions. AMETEK had a very strong year of acquisitions in 2011, deploying nearly $475 million in capital and acquiring approximately $215 million in annual revenue. We're off to a tremendous start in 2012 with the acquisition of O'Brien Corporation in the first quarter, and as we announced this morning, the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Dunkermotoren. With the contemplated acquisition of Dunkermotoren, we will have acquired approximately $280 million in revenue thus far in 2012. ","I will discuss the Dunkermotoren acquisition in a moment, but first I wanted to discuss the acquisition of O'Brien, which we completed in January. O'Brien is a leading manufacturer of fluid and gas handling solutions, sample conditioning equipment and process analyzers using critical applications in the process industries worldwide. O'Brien was privately held and has an annual sales of approximately $80 million. The price paid was approximately $175 million. O'Brien's product offering includes pre-insulated tubing bundles, sample conditioning equipment, specialty electropolished tubing for use in high purity applications, instrument enclosures and process analyzers. Its products are used to enable the capture, transport and analysis of liquids, gases, vapors and emissions in challenging process environments such as oil and gas production, refining, petrochemical processing, power generation, pharmaceutical manufacturing and semiconductor fabrication. O'Brien's product lines are both highly differentiated and highly complementary to AMETEK's Process Instrument businesses. Combined with our analytical instrument solutions, AMETEK now can offer its customers a complete solution for all of their process analysis needs. In addition, we expect to leverage the strong customer relationships of the combined businesses and AMETEK's global capability to further extend O'Brien's market reach. ","Now, turning to Dunkermotoren. AMETEK announced this morning that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Dunkermotoren, a global leader in highly engineered brush and brushless motion control solutions for a wide range of industrial automation applications. Dunkermotoren is privately held and has expected 2012 sales of approximately EUR 155 million, or about $200 million. The business is headquartered in Bonndorf, Germany, with additional manufacturing locations in China, Serbia and the U.K. Approximately 60% of their sales are outside of Europe. Completion of the acquisition is subject to German government approval, as well as normal closing conditions. We expect to complete the transaction in the second quarter. ","This company is an excellent strategic and highly complementary fit with our  Precision Motion Control business, and expands our leadership position in niche rotary and linear motion applications. In addition, it broadens our manufacturing capabilities in both Europe and China and greatly expands our presence in key industrial end markets worldwide. We're very excited about the opportunity to acquire such an outstanding company in Dunkermotoren, and we'll provide further information on the business upon completion of the transaction. ","Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2012 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We had the managerial and financial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition's focus. Our backlog of deals remain excellent. Our balance sheet is strong, and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. ","Turning to the outlook now for 2012. We expect our businesses to continue to show solid growth in 2012 with our longer cycle Aerospace, Oil& Gas and Power businesses showing particular strength. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven Operational Excellence capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform very well in 2012. ","We anticipate 2012 revenue to be up low double digits on a percentage basis from 2011. Organic growth is expected to be up mid-single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2012 are now expected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.75 per diluted share, up 14% to 16% over 2011, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth and our Operational Excellence initiatives. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $2.65 to $2.70 per diluted share. ","Second quarter 2012 sales are expected to be up approximately 10% from last year's second quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.65 to $0.68 per diluted share, up 12% to 17% over last year's second quarter. The estimates provided for the second quarter and the full year do not include any impact from the pending Dunkermotoren acquisition. ","John will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions.","John J. Molinelli","Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had an outstanding first quarter with excellent financial performance and a high quality of earnings, and I will provide some further details. Core growth and selling expenses in the quarter was in line with core growth and sales. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales, below last year's first quarter level of 1.5% of sales. ","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.9%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 32.2%. We anticipate a tax rate of between 30% and 31% for the full year of 2012. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate. ","On the balance sheet. Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory, less payables, was 17.2% of sales in the first quarter, down from 18.3% in last year's first quarter, reflecting the continued focus and efforts of our operating teams to reduce our investment here. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. ","Capital spending was $8 million for the quarter. Full year 2012 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $60 million. Depreciation and amortization was $25 million for the quarter. 2012 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $100 million. Our cash flow was very strong in the first quarter. Operating cash flow is $141 million, up 36% over last year's first quarter. And free cash flow was $132 million for the quarter, representing 120% of net income. ","Total debt was $1.36 billion at March 31, up $96 million from year end. Expenditures for acquisitions through the first quarter totaled approximately $175 million. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $219 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at March 31, of 34.3%, down from 34.8% at the end of 2011. At March 31, we had approximately $875 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. ","In summary, we had an outstanding first quarter, establishing records for essentially all the key financial metrics. We're well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows. Kevin?","Kevin C. Coleman","Thank you, John. Great. Tara, we're now ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robert Barry from UBS.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I know you guys tend to be conservative, but I just was trying to square the revenue guidance, especially for the second quarter. With the order growth and the impact from M&A, I mean, it looks like a significant slowdown from what you did in the first quarter. And I think I can get kind of 6%, 7%, 8% of growth just from the deals you've kind of done already, excluding the one you announced today. So is that just really conservative, is there kind of anything happening in the core growth rate, maybe easing a bit? If you could just talk a little bit about that, it would be great.","Frank S. Hermance","Sure. I'd be glad to do that. First of all, the acquisition that we announced today, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is not included in any of the estimates we provided. Obviously, that deal is not closed at this point, so we did not feel it appropriate to provide any estimates. We did say that it's going to close in the second quarter, but it could close right at the end of the second quarter. We are dependent on German approvals of the government there as well as the normal closing conditions. So when you actually look at the order and the sales guidance we've given you, it's roughly the same as the first quarter. It's not substantially different than the first quarter. We did have very good order intake in the first quarter. A lot of it was in our longer cycle businesses, which are going to tend to shift in the second half of the year. And there are also maybe a tad of conservatism in our estimates.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Could you comment perhaps on what you're seeing in Europe and what the change, if any, has been in that region?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, sure. Europe is an interesting story for us. Overall, our organic growth in Europe was quite good. It was up actually about 7% in the first quarter. And we saw very, very strong performance in our Aerospace businesses. And also one of our companies in France, CAMECA, which makes a very high-end analytic type instrumentation, saw excellent, excellent sales. So those very positive impacts were the drivers for the 7% organic growth. There was some weakness that we saw in our other businesses, but nothing that I would consider sizable at this point in time.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, I was just wondering if could update us on what your expectations is for EBIT margin expansion? I think at 4Q, you had said about 30 basis points. And I'm sorry if I missed it in your comments, but just given the very strong performance in 1Q, I'm wondering what your thoughts are now for the year.","Frank S. Hermance","No, you're right. You're absolutely right that I didn't say anything in my comments. But, yes, I indicated up 30 basis points in the talk at the end of the year. And we're now estimating, and I would say conservatively, 40 basis points, and hopefully we'll be able to continue to increase that guidance as we go through the year. Obviously, the capability right now and the flow-through in the company is just, just absolutely incredible. The contribution margin in the company in the first quarter was north of 40%, so very, very strong contribution margins. And you couple that with the Operational Excellence activities, where we expect to put about $60 million of cost improvements through the P&L this year, bodes well for margins.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Yes, especially given the 90 you did in the first quarter.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, exactly.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Going back to Europe, could you give a little more color in terms of what your end market exposure is? Like how big is Aerospace? Does Oil & Gas play any part of that as well?","Frank S. Hermance","You're talking about overall for the company now?","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, overall for Europe, yes. AMETEK Europe.","Frank S. Hermance","Oh, for Europe. The overall amount of business that AMETEK has in Europe is about 26% of our total sales. So it's about the right proportion in terms of our market concentration. And that breaks down, roughly 1\/3 is in Aerospace & Defense related activities. We have very strong concentration in the Process industries, including Oil & Gas, but not just Oil & Gas. We also have our Ultra Precision Technology (sic) [Technologies] business, which is a part of our European sales. And as I think I've mentioned in previous calls, we also roll up the Middle East into our Europe numbers, although that wasn't really the driver for the excellent core growth we had in the quarter. So it is a mix, but there is good concentration of Aerospace & Defense in our European content. And obviously, Aerospace, and even the Defense portion of Aerospace in Europe, did quite well.","Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then going back to the EBIT expansion, the 40 basis points, is there any way to say acquisitions are holding it back by 10 or 20 basis points with the acquisition-related costs?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, actually, I haven't done that calculation, but the deals that we have done recently, and actually, will also include Dunkermotoren, assuming we close it, are very strong margin businesses, so I don't expect a huge amount of dilution. But there will be some, especially as our growth from acquisitions is going to accelerate as the year goes on.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I was just wondering, Frank, if you could do your typical by-division sales sum-up, that would be helpful.","Frank S. Hermance","Sure, I'd be glad to do that. Why don't I start with Aerospace, which had a really, really good first quarter? We had low double-digit organic sales and order growth with really broad-based strength across all parts of that Aerospace business. We expect to see continued growth for our Aerospace business in 2012 as the trends and order rates, OEM build rates and revenue passenger miles really support strong commercial third-party MRO, and also business in regional jet sales. Actually, I was just reading in the Wall Street before I came in to this conference call that Boeing is expecting to increase their production by about 40% by the end of 2014, so a very substantial change there, which obviously is going to be a nice driver for our growth. Right now for all of 2012, we are expecting our commercial and third-party MRO businesses to be up high single digits. Our business and regional jet business should be up low double digits, and that's based more on wins than it is on the actual market for business and regional jets turning around. And then our military business, we're still saying flat, although we did have a fairly strong first quarter and there may be some conservatism in our forecast for the military side of the business. So if you sum up, we're expecting organic growth in the mid to high-single digits for all of 2012 for Aerospace. And obviously, this is one of our higher profit margin businesses. So I think it's going to be a driver to our performance for a quite an extended period of time. Process, our Process markets performed extremely well in the first quarter. Overall sales were up about 25%, and organic sales were up about 10%. Strong growth was evident across most of our businesses. Our Oil & Gas business continue to show sizable strength, while our Material Analysis, Ultra Precision Technology (sic) [Technologies] and also our Advanced Measurement Technology division were very strong. In addition, we had the benefits from the Reichert Technologies, TMC and O'Brien acquisitions. For 2012, we're expecting this business to grow mid-teens overall, with mid-single-digit organic growth. And in particular, we expect continued strong performance from our later cycle Oil & Gas businesses. And the last part of EIG, Scott, is Power and Industrial. Overall, Q1 sales were up low double-digits driven by mid-single-digit organic growth and the contribution from the EM Test acquisition that we did last year. For all of 2012, we're expecting sales for Power and Industrial to be up low double-digits overall with mid-single-digit organic growth, and that'll be actually balanced growth between the process and industrial parts of that business. So if you take those discussions and look at EIG overall, for 2012, we're expecting overall sales to be up about mid-teens on a percentage basis and organic growth of mid-single digits. Switching to the other half of the company, in EMG for our differentiated EMG businesses, sales were up low teens in Q1, while organic sales were solid. And they had growth in the mid-single digits organically. We saw strong growth from our third-party MRO businesses and also our military businesses, as I mentioned in the answer to Allison's question. And we also augmented that with the acquisitions of Avicenna Technology and Coining. We're expecting for the differentiated part of EMG for all of 2012 will be up approximately 10% overall with organic growth of mid-single digits. And the last part of our company, which is really the legacy businesses, our cost driven motor business, kind of a mixed story here. Orders were up 10% in the first quarter, but sales were actually down about mid-single digits. And for 2012, we're expecting sales to be roughly flat over 2011. And I think as you know, we don't manage this business for growth. We really manage it very heavily for profitability through our Operational Excellence activities. So if you sum these 2 parts of EMG, we're expecting overall sales for EMG to be up mid to high single digits and organic growth should be in that mid-single digit region. If we get the high-single-digit overall growth, we'll be at the high end of the mid-single digit organically, and vice versa. If it's a little bit weaker, then it will be on the other side. And I think the wildcard there is although we saw good order growth in cost driven motors, it'll be interesting to see how that translates as we go through the year. So if you sum the company up then, as I've said in my opening remarks for AMETEK as a whole, we're expecting low double-digit sales growth on a percentage basis, and organic growth in this mid-single-digit arena.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Frank, just wondering how long you've been looking at Dunkermotoren and if there was a typical cycle time or sort of a unique process.","Frank S. Hermance","That's a great question, Chris. We've probably been looking at this company for 4 to 5 years. It was #1 on the acquisition agenda for our Precision Motion Control business. Our Precision Motion Control business has very strong content in the U.S. and very strong content in Asia but did not have strong content in Europe. And Dunkermotoren basically has a very similar type of approach to the market. They get extremely good margins, and they complement our business just like a glove. So we have remained in contact with this company, actually even through a change in ownership to the present owner. And we actually contacted the owner ourselves, and were able to strike a deal. And we've got a lot of hired people here. I think they signed this deal at about 3:00 or 4:00 this morning. So we're very pleased with it. It's a great business, great complement, as a matter of fact both of these acquisitions. O'Brien and Dunkermotoren are just ideal fits with AMETEK. We understand the businesses. We can improve them, we can leverage them. And I would say, both management teams are also extremely excited about being part of our company. We were their #1 choice in terms of who would acquire them. But yes, it was sort of a long process, but we always hang in there, and it turned out great.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Sounds like maybe you should grab a nap after the call. Wondering also on the acquisition pipeline if you've seen any in the third-party MRO pre-PMA type area.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, that's another question, Chris. Yes, we have. We actually -- over the course of the last couple of years, we've been somewhat quiet on that front. And we actually had a couple of deals that got fairly close to fruition and then didn't happen for one reason or another. But yes, there are some deals in our backlog. That business performed remarkably well in the first quarter. I think you know as we started to roll up these companies, typically these companies have 10% kind of pretax margins because they can't leverage the PMA and DDR capability the way we're able to. And I can tell you that, that total third-party MRO business right now has got to operating margins that are just under 20%, so very sizable improvement. And as well, they were one of our higher growth parts of Aerospace. So we would like to do more transactions here. We've got some backlog, and hopefully you'll be hearing from us in this area.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets.","James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on Dunkermotoren here. And when you look at that sitting in the Precision Motion, how big is Precision Motion now for you?","Frank S. Hermance","It's about that same size, so it's -- and this is going to be a sizable increase in that business. So, Bill, look it up and see how close I am in my estimates. Bill's going to look it up, but it's roughly that same size.","James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Well, knowing your track record, you're pretty close, Frank.","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, Bill says I'm pretty close.","James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And good color on Europe. BRIC rose up 20%. We've heard a lot of conflicting reports about China in particular. You've been making a lot of investments in Brazil and India. Can you just give us an update on what you're seeing in emerging markets, China in particular?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, I can, Jim. There's no question that I can feel some slowing in China, but when you look at slowing from a GDP of 9% to 7%, it's still obviously one of the stronger GDP growths in the world. So we saw very good performance in China. I mentioned the BRIC countries were up about 20% in sales and China was right in that region, and I think it was around 19%. So we were fine. And it will be interesting to see how the year plays out, but largely for us, it's a share gain. So we are getting the growth from share. And it's not as much dictated specifically by the GDPs of that country. India, I did see an article in the Wall Street Journal this morning talking about a potential downgrade from S&P for India, which actually surprised me a bit, but we saw a very good performance in India in the first quarter. It was also right in that same region of about 20% growth. And again, it is largely a share gain for us in India. In Brazil, Brazil was actually a bit weaker for us in the first quarter, but the order growth was really, really super there. And some of that is due to the fact that we have some floorcare motor business down there, and it has not been a favorable climate season for that particular floorcare. I say floorcare, but it's actually in lawn and garden and those types of applications. So that's what drove that. Actually, I was just talk to the group president for our Process businesses, and he said, looking at his businesses down there -- he just spent 3 or 4 days down there -- they're growing very, very rapidly. So a little bit of a mixed bag there, but overall the order growth was good. So I suspect it will be fine for the rest of the year. So I think the best way I can characterize this for us is a little bit of weakening. We're not growing at the same rates that maybe we were last year, but still this is the organic growth engine for us.","James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And 2 housekeeping questions for John. One, I missed D&A for the quarter. And two, payables.","John J. Molinelli","D&A was $25 million, Jim. And payables is $291 million.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On Dunkermotoren, I just wondered if you have -- is there a purchase price on the deal that you can tell us?","Frank S. Hermance","Well, that's a great question. And we have agreed with the sellers that until we close, we're not going to give a specific number. But I can tell you that this is a typical AMETEK deal. I think you know we don't pay multiples that are double digits. And I think when we do release the final purchase price and the multiples, you'll see this is right in line with a typical AMETEK acquisition.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. It sounds like it might be operating at margins that are slightly higher than EMG today overall.","Frank S. Hermance","Than EMG, you said?","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right.","Frank S. Hermance","Well, I'm not supposed to be talking about this, but your assumption is a good one.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You also mentioned that it's a very nice complement. Do you see opportunity for synergies with...","Frank S. Hermance","Oh, yes, absolutely. We see opportunities for synergy. There's going to be cross-selling opportunities where they have a capability that -- and not huge share in the U.S., so they can capitalize on that. Also in the other direction, our U.S.-based businesses can capitalize on their distribution capability. In Europe, we see cost synergies. They have a plant in Serbia, and we spent a lot of time looking at Serbia because it's a part of the world that we had very little exposure to. And that could end up being another low-cost platform for AMETEK. So that's another synergy that we see in this deal. So I think again this will be a normal AMETEK acquisition and that we'll have good synergies, ability to increase profitability. And as I said, that management team and the management team within AMETEK are really excited about this; 2 very strong management teams, and they can't wait to really have this thing closed and start to capitalize on each other's capability.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And you mentioned your segment detail. It doesn't sound like there's any real major change there. Is there any different expectation by geography as you look at the year at this point?","Frank S. Hermance","I would say that maybe the only difference is we probably won't see quite as much growth in China as we were originally hoping for. But offsetting that is our Aerospace businesses are stronger than we had anticipated. So it feels like we're going to end up in the same position, but maybe with a little bit of shift there. But to your opening comment, I don't think it's material. It's not significant.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one last quick one. On the guidance for 2Q, you're not assuming any Dunkermotoren contribution, but I assume there will be M&A expenses associated with it that you are assuming on the cost side?","Frank S. Hermance","No. I guess we did roll -- we rolled it through already, some of it, didn't we, guys?","John J. Molinelli","Yes.","Frank S. Hermance","We rolled it through already. So there might be a little bit more, but it's actually in the first quarter results. That's when the majority of our costs were done. And there's not going to be any huge restructuring charges, et cetera, as we go forward. As you know, we're very, very conscious about continually not hitting the P&L with these extraneous charges, so don't expect anything substantial from any of these deals as we go forward. And as I said, this is just going to be a typical deal for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions. Frank, you mentioned your networking capital coming in at 18%, maybe a little bit higher than that, which is down, I believe, over last few years from the low 20s. For a company like AMETEK, looking out over the next 2 to 3 years, what is the right number on your networking capital? Can you get it down into the low teens? And I guess, along those lines, how much incremental cash do you think you can get out of working capital?","Frank S. Hermance","I'll answer the first part, and John can answer the second part. The 17 -- actually what we did in the quarter was 17.2%, and we're fairly comfortable with that kind of number. What actually happens, and it was evident when we put our budget together this year, is that as we acquired companies and bring them into our fold, very few operate at this 17.2% or 17% type of number. So our objective is really to maintain that kind of level as we acquire these companies, which means we have to be continually improving the working capital of those acquired companies. But I don't see our mix of businesses getting down to the low teens. We have some businesses that get there, but not for all of AMETEK. If you recall, we have some businesses like our metals businesses and even our -- some of our other more capital-intensive businesses that do have a bit higher working capital. But we're very pleased at this 17% level. And, John, you might be able to answer to the cash question.","John J. Molinelli","Well, I would take it to just a little bit ingredients [ph] to what you said, Frank. I would -- if you look at 2012, we anticipated a number of this 17.2%, but it's a mixture of our base businesses beating that with the acquisitions that we did last year coming in around 26%. And as we go through the year, that number gets better and better. And then you roll that number, Matt, into 2013, that 26% is going to become maybe close to 20%. And we'll pull cash out of those businesses while we run our base businesses in that 16.5% to 17% range. In the aggregate, we've got some of them that are much better than that. So that's the picture I would paint. But we'd be taking cash out of the acquisitions, getting them into that sweet spot of around 16.5%, 17%, 17.5% from an overall perspective.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just on the military portion of your business, Frank, you indicated that was up in Q1. What's driving that? And I guess, as we move throughout the year, are there specific content wins that you have that give you confidence that, that business isn't going to slip in terms of revenue or potentially even grow?","Frank S. Hermance","It's a great question. And we were -- at least, I was actually surprised at the strength in the first quarter. It was quite good. And it wasn't just on the sales side. Our order intake was very, very good. And it was particularly good in Europe. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're being a bit conservative as we go forward, but I have no indications that this business is going to become a major drain. I think the question is more how much upside are we going to get out of it and are the first quarter results something that we can repeat through the year. Actually, I was just talking  to our group president about this exact thing. And our position is really, we're going to wait another quarter, and we'll see how well it does. And if the order intake is good in the second quarter -- it started out okay in April -- we may be raising our guidance here. But I don't think we're worried about some dramatic negative impact of military. And it is. I mean, to your point, Matt, there is -- we're on some really good platforms, particularly in Europe. And this is a platform type of business, and the dollars are still coming in. So it's going to be a wait and see.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then, Frank, in your opening remarks, early on you mentioned that orders organically up year-over-year, sequentially 15 -- or excuse me, in total, do you have the organic numbers for orders?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, organic growth was relatively flat across -- or against a very tough comparison.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","What is the backlog right now?","Frank S. Hermance","$947 million. We're about $800,000 short of a record.","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Is the order, what, 911, last quarter?","Frank S. Hermance","I think that's right.","John J. Molinelli","I think that's right.","Frank S. Hermance","I think that's right, and that's, that book-to-bill of 1.04 that I was talking about.","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, yes. And then, Frank, did I miss it? Did you talk about what the organic growth rates were in the U.S., North America and then what you're seeing there?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, I'll just give them all to you so you have them. The Far East was 15% organically. As I already mentioned, Europe was 7% organically; The U.S. was about 4% organically.","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","So what's -- could you discuss the relative weakness in the U.S. given, actually, that the PMI has been a lot better in the U.S. versus any place else?","Frank S. Hermance","I understand, but I think you've got to almost turn it around and that we had really strong growth in the other parts of the world. The U.S. came in pretty much as we had anticipated, and Europe, for the reasons we've already talked about, came in much stronger than we had, had anticipated. And Asia was a tad weaker. So I don't think it's like we feel there's some problem in the U.S. It's more sort of good news in the other parts of the world, in particular Europe. And I'm probably one of the few CEOs that's talking about good news in Europe.","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Right. Well, I guess I would've guessed that U.S. would have been higher, seeing then some other companies that the U.S. is still very strong, but I'm just curious if there was certain parts of the U.S. that's on your products' end markets that were under expectations?","Frank S. Hermance","No, I would say, we had said mid-single digits. So it's pretty much what we expected, pretty much what we expected. And there's nothing of concern or alarm in the U.S. Most of our markets are okay. So, yes, there's nothing that I can comment on to your point.","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. With Dunkermotoren -- what is their, I guess, it seems sounds like pretty diversified. But with the Precision Motion Company in Germany, is solar big enough to be a concern for them at this point or are they pretty well diversified across the pipeline?","Frank S. Hermance","Just like our business in the U.S., this is a highly diversified business. No key end market, no key customer, very, very diverse. And winning this business based on being able to very rapidly customize motors for a particular application. And there's just no single concentration that you can point to that's going to be an issue for them.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Frank, could you provide just maybe a little bit of color, or John, on the gross margin? When you look at that year-over-year, the 110 bps of improvement, how much of that is driven by your current sales mix and growth in the Aerospace, Process versus acquisition accretion or price? Are you getting some price here in the quarter?","John J. Molinelli","We are getting some price, Richard. We're probably pulling net of inflation of about a little less than 1% through, so that's contributed. But there's so many ingredients that go into that to try to break it down and beyond that. We've got that $10 million of cost savings Frank talked about. That's running ahead of our expectations. Gosh, the mix has been very good. No question about that. So there's probably half a dozen variables that are trending positive.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. But we are seeing the upward buys in the margins from these later cycle, or longer cycle business acceleration.","John J. Molinelli","No question about that. No question about that. I mean...","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That kind of margin expansion of the gross line is pretty sustainable as long as we're in this -- we stay in this longer cycle mix, [indiscernible] mix.","John J. Molinelli","No question, especially looking out with the Aerospace strength that we see, that has got a very positive contribution to the higher margins.","Frank S. Hermance","We don't actually, in contrast to other businesses that I've been involved in, we don't focus at the gross margin line because the gross margins of our businesses have very wide diversity amongst them. We really focus on the contribution margin and the absolute margin to the bottom line. And just to augment what John said, the contribution margin in our Aerospace businesses is essentially the highest in the company. It's very, very good. So that's why the contribution margin, overall in the quarter, was up above 40%.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And that -- so overall when I look at the reported incremental, we're more in the high 20s, obviously, influenced by the acquisition contribution and pull down there. But your core incremental for AMETEK was in the low 40s?","Frank S. Hermance","Yes, actually it was even a bit higher than that. But it was really good. But you're absolutely right that when we talk about contribution margin, we exclude the acquisitions because obviously you're not going to get the flow-through to the same level on the acquisitions, so we just extract them. And that's where this 40% plus number comes from.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question. Frank, when I look at the organic order number, order growth rate or flat growth in orders in the core business, is there anything in the mix of order flow that gives you a better feel or a good feel for your markets? For instance, long cycle, I think had you mentioned long cycle orders, business orders were up. Is there anything on the short cycle side that causes you concern or...","Frank S. Hermance","No, I mean, a part of our short cycle business that we are concerned about is always our cost driven motor business. But obviously, as I mentioned, that part of the business on the order intake was pretty good. This is really -- the fact that we had very, very strong performance last year on orders. And as we were coming sort of up from the depths of the recession, we were swinging back in sort of a V-shaped manner. And some of our order flows in those first couple of quarters last year were just very, very strong. So I'm not looking at anything in that number that is overly concerning to me.","Operator","Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time.","Kevin C. Coleman","Okay. Fantastic.
