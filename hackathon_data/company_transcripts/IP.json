My name is Patrick, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Jay Royalty, to begin the conference. Jay?","Jay Royalty","Thanks a lot, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are John Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation.","We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter press release and today's presentation slides.","Lastly, Slide 4 provides context around the Ilim joint ventures, financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John Faraci.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Jay, and good morning to everybody. As we normally do, Carol and I are going to review the second quarter 2014 results and the performance of individual businesses, then we'll speak to the third quarter outlook and open it up for your questions.","So I'm going to start them on Slide 5. International Paper delivered strong earnings performance in the second quarter, driven by very strong results in our North American Industrial Packaging business and solid performance around the globe in other key businesses.","Our North American businesses saw an expected recovery from a weather-impacted first quarter, but we also continued to have higher-than-expected input costs.","Additionally, we successfully executed almost $200 million of maintenance outages across the enterprise and, importantly, we didn't let that get in the way of continuing to operate in a very solid fashion.","Ilim continues to be a good news story, with solid operational EBITDA attributable to benefits from the continued improvement at both projects, Koryazhma and Bratsk. And despite some softness in the pulp markets in the second quarter, the joint venture also had a favorable FX gain as the ruble strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Think of that as a reversal from the opposite we had in the first quarter.","In early July, IP's Board of Directors approved an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization, which extends the program implemented last September, and Carol's going to update you on second quarter activity a little bit later on in the presentation.","On the people front. We announced the appointment of Mark Sutton as President and Chief Operating Officer of International Paper on January 1. The board and I are very pleased to have Mark in that role. He's an experienced global leader and operator, knows IP and the industry well. He's with us here in the room today and will participate in the Q&A portion of the call.","Finally, we completed the xpedx transaction on July 1, as IP spun off our North American distribution business and merged it with Unisource to create a new publicly traded company called Veritiv, which is now trading on the New York Stock Exchange. And I want to wish all of our former colleagues and Mary Laschinger, the Chairman and CEO of Veritiv, a lot of success going forward, and wish the new company well.","So let's move on to the financials. That's Slide 6. EPS was $0.95 a share, up almost 50% over the second quarter of last year. EBITDA was $1.1 billion, up from $920 million in the first quarter. Margins grew as well, up 90 basis points over last year and 160 basis points over the first quarter. Free cash flow was $380 million compared to $250 million in the first quarter.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Carol and let her walk through the details on the quarter and the business results, and then we'll get to the forecast outlook and your questions.","Carol L. Roberts","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me turn to the sequential EPS bridge, where it shows that we are $0.95 per share in the second quarter versus $0.61 per share in the first quarter. The strong results were driven by price improvement across several of the businesses. We had higher volume, solid operational performance across the enterprise and a significant positive noncash FX swing as the ruble recovered against the U.S. dollar on Ilim's JV U.S.-denominated debt.","These positive swings were partially offset by significantly higher outage costs, as planned in the quarter, and as John referenced, they went very well.","Some of the improvement in volume, operations and input costs, I can say, were attributable to moving past the weather disruptions in North America that did plague the first quarter. But beyond that, we experienced seasonal improvement in demand in North American Industrial Packaging and solid operating performance on all fronts.","Courtland closure and transition costs were lower in the quarter, as expected. Input costs moderated slightly. However, I would say that they remained high throughout the quarter, and we're going to talk about the outlook going forward.","Corporate items were slightly favorable, but they were more than offset by a slightly higher tax rate of 32%, as expected, and higher interest cost due to a tax reserve that was established in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 8. I want to take a look at the year-over-year input costs for the first half of 2014. And as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, wood and energy have been significantly higher, probably a bit higher than expected and significantly higher than last year.","While they moderated slightly in the second quarter, we are seeing continued pressure on wood, higher electricity costs and higher chemical costs as we move through the third quarter.","Turning now to the businesses. Industrial Packaging delivered strong results as prices held firm, volume increased, operations were solid and input costs moderated slightly. Pricing was stable in North America and up in Brazil.","Volume was seasonally stronger in North America, and we also experienced significantly higher volume in our European Package -- Packaging business, as year-over-year volumes were up 5% for the second quarter and 4% year-to-date. So a very strong performance out of our European Packaging business.","Operations recovered following the weather-plagued first quarter, and we successfully executed peak maintenance outages of $91 million. Input costs were lower by $13 million, primarily natural gas and OCC.","As I move you to Slide 10, and take a look at the North American margin comparisons, IP and our team turned in another strong quarter and continues to outperform our primary competitors. These margins are inclusive of the significant maintenance downtime that we took in the quarter.","Slide 11. I thought it'd be good if we took a look at our volume results for the U.S. Corrugated business. And as you can see, we were up a little over 5% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, right in line with the industry.","It's interesting to note that when you take a look, a little deeper dive at our performance regionally, you can see that IP outperformed the industry east of the Rockies. The east of the Rockies represents about 82% of our business. We underperformed west of the Rockies, the remaining 18%. Our underperformance in the west is largely attributable to our heavy exposure to the agricultural box segment, which is having a tough growing season due to a number of unfavorable weather patterns. When you look at the right-hand side of the slide, we show some of our larger segments and how we're performing versus the average. You can see that poultry as well as shipping and distribution, and shipping and distribution does include e-commerce, are performing well. While, as I mentioned, ag is down, processed foods and the beverage segment, which are a couple of the largest segments we have, are basically flat year-to-date. I think this explains a lot about the overall results for not only International Paper but the industry.","So our success in Industrial Packaging is evidenced in both our margin and our commercial and volume performance.","We bring a lot of value to our customers that we serve. We have a top-notch commercial team, manufacturing and supply chain organization that is winning in the marketplace every day and, importantly, helping our customers win.","So moving on to Consumer Packaging on Page 12. The Consumer Packaging business, we're starting to see the benefits of our commercial momentum that we've been talking about as we move past the last of the significant not only North American outages but European outages.","Prices were up, on average, in our North American Coated Paperboard business, about $20 a ton. Volumes in both North America Coated Paperboard and our Foodservice business were up in the quarter, offset by lower volume in Europe due to a significant maintenance outage at our Kwidzyn mill.","Our North American Foodservice business had a record quarter on revenue, up 11% year-over-year. Operations improved significantly as we moved past the weather and delivered solid performance for the quarter.","Moving to Slide 13. As we've talked about previously, Consumer Packaging is really a second-half story. The first half results have clearly been burdened with the weather, heavy maintenance outages, high input costs and the construction and start-up of our grade enhancement project at our Kwidzyn, Poland mill.","As we move into the second half of the year, most of our outage costs are behind us, volume will be higher due to less planned maintenance downtime, higher cup stock volumes due to the Foodservice growth and the growing shift from foam to paper cups, which is a real positive for us on both sides.","Also, we expect to see additional benefits from the ramp-up of the new grade, Alaska Plus, out of our Kwidzyn, Poland mill.","And finally, we'll see continued realization of the previously announced North American SBS price increases. This is all going to translate into higher earnings for the business for the balance of '14.","Turning now to our global Printing Papers business. We experienced higher pricing in North America on uncoated freesheet and fluff pulp, as well as in Brazil on papers. Volumes were lower in North America as well as Brazil. Operations improved as, once again, we moved past the weather and performed well. Maintenance outages were high, offsetting $30 million of segment earnings, and input costs moderated slightly. And as I have previously mentioned, we did have lower costs at Courtland, as expected. The positive swing in other is primarily related to some favorable FX impact that we saw in Brazil.","Looking at Slide 15. We thought it would be instructive to take a closer look at the sequential earnings across the Printing Papers business on a regional basis. And I would say that we feel the results were encouraging, really, across the globe. As a reminder, we have a truly global paper business. Roughly 2\/3 of what we sell is produced outside North America. As this slide shows, North America was up solidly in both Printing Papers and pulp. Brazil was up as well, despite significant volume constraints, attributable to the additional government-declared holidays around the World Cup event and really less-than-robust demand.","Europe was down, but that was entirely attributable to $23 million in higher outage expenses in the quarter. And for our Indian businesses, it was basically flat.","So all in, the business performed well in the face of a mediocre global demand environment.","Touching on the Ilim JV. It's good to report that the JV had another solid quarter of operating performance, as we had continued progress with both the ramp-up of Bratsk and continued good performance out of the Koryazhma mill. And this largely offset some lower pulp prices that we sold to China.","Additionally, as John mentioned, we did have the positive swing to the JV earnings as the ruble strengthened against the U.S. dollar on the JV's $1.5 billion U.S.-denominated debt. The JV took a significant outage at the Bratsk mill at the beginning of the third quarter to address a bottleneck issue with the pulp digester, the cost of which will impact negatively our earnings in the third quarter.","But the great news is productivity coming out of the outage is very encouraging and should enable acceleration of the JV's progress towards the final ramp-up to the original pulp mill project expectations.","So let me kind of pull it all together on Slide 17, and take a look, moving forward, to the third quarter. As we see it, volume across the enterprise will be relatively stable, with some improvement in North America Consumer Packaging, as I described earlier. Pricing will be largely stable as well, with some continued realization of the previously announced price increases on fluff pulp and in our Coated Paperboard business in North America. We expect solid operating performance to continue across the businesses, and maintenance outages will be lower by a significant $135 million in the third quarter.","We do expect input costs that will remain elevated and, in some cases, will increase slightly, as we've noted on the chart. In North America, our Papers and Packaging businesses, we expect to see continued pressure on wood costs, particularly in Texas and the surrounding region, along with higher electricity costs and higher chemical costs. In Brazil, we expect to see higher energy and fiber costs as well.","At the Ilim JV, as always, we don't forecast FX movements, so the assumption is that, that gain of $0.07 won't repeat. And also, we have the additional cost of the outage at Bratsk early in the quarter. The anticipation of continued operational benefits, post the outage, are offset by lower average pulp prices for the quarter.","And finally, with the spin of xpedx at the beginning of the third quarter, there is a nonrepeat of earnings and, additionally, an equivalent amount of transitional costs, much of which will work off over time.","So finally, on 18, a couple more things to update on before I turn it back over to John. I think it's worth highlighting some of the significant developments in the quarter with regard to the company's finances. As you know, IP is in an excellent position, and we continue to get stronger.","First, based on the consistency of our solid financial performance, Moody's upgraded our credit rating one notch. Additionally, in the quarter, we executed a bond issuance and a tender offer that enabled us to address the upcoming debt towers in 2018 and '19 and replace high-cost debt with lower-cost debt. We were able to take advantage of these historically low interest rates on 10- and 30-year debt and take some risk off the table in the upcoming term. As John mentioned earlier, we successfully executed the xpedx spin on July 1, and we received $400 million in cash. And additionally, our shareowners got 51% of the new company, Veritiv.","We also received an additional $1.5 billion share buyback authorization from the board. In the quarter, we purchased $296 million of stock at an average price of just over $46.","And from the inception of the program through June 30, we've purchased approximately $1.1 billion of stock at an average price of $46 a share.","And finally, I want to mention that there's a potential Highway Trust Fund legislation that could have a positive impact on reducing future pension contributions, likely in the range of $800 million to $1 billion over the next few years.","While there would be a corresponding loss of the tax deduction for these contributions, this would have a positive impact on cash available for reallocation.","So all in all, some very good developments and accomplishments in the second quarter. So with that, let me turn it back over to John.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Carol. So summing up. The IP leadership team continues to find ways to build on our success and improve the strength and, importantly, the performance of International Paper.","In addition to the accomplishments that Carol spoke about and, as I've said before, we've got many levers to pull to improve and deliver strong results despite a challenging global environment. We seem to come up with new reasons to have a challenging global environment every day, it seems. But I'm pleased with the progress we're making and the results we're posting along the way. We're generating strong, sustainable free cash flow, and we're deploying that cash with the objective of maximizing shareowner value. So all in, as we look to the future, we like what's ahead.","And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Gail Glazerman from UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, just starting with -- and I know there were some comments on the news wires this morning. But can you talk a little bit about the MLP potential and how you would think about that and kind of how you -- just what obstacles and opportunities you might see?","John V. Faraci","Sure.","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, Gail. This is Carol. First, let me say, very importantly, that we maintain a constructive and open dialogue with all our shareholders. And we're always open to new ideas and ways to increase shareholder value. We have been studying the MLPs for some time. And for us, it just remains unclear as to whether this concept would really be value-creating for the company. Today, as I think everybody knows, and it's been written about, there is a moratorium on private letter rulings at the IRS. And there has been one prior favorable ruling on pulp but, as everybody knows, there's no precedent for containerboard or coated paperboard at this time. So all that said, even if we could get a private letter ruling from the IRS, we're not yet -- and I would say we're somewhat far from convinced that this would be a good idea, and a good idea, on a number of fronts, that are unique to International Paper and the business we're in. The first issue that you have is the potential tax cost and the tax leakage, given that the assets involved here are fairly highly depreciated. The other consideration that we're looking at very hard is the operational, commercial challenges and some of the restrictions on how it would require us to run the business. And then the third piece that really plays into an MLP is the capital considerations. And as everybody knows, in our business, we're a capital-intensive industry, and sometimes the capital, particularly in these big and integrated mills, can be fairly lumpy. So all that said, we're going to continue to evaluate it until we can reach a conclusion for ourselves and, importantly, until the IRS makes clear what their new requirements are going to be for MLPs. And so in the interim, we\u2019ll continue to operate our business as is, and we expect to do so for the foreseeable future. So we'll continue to study it and we'll look at it. And we're -- as we said, we're always looking for creative ways to unlock more value.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And can you just give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of demand trends in the third quarter? And maybe how this transitions from the second quarter into third quarter, I guess, in terms of key businesses as well as key global regions.","John V. Faraci","Bill, do you want to talk about the box business?","William P. Hoel","Going from the second quarter into the third quarter, we're not seeing much of a change in overall demand trend. We saw a week -- first week of the quarter with the holiday ending on a Friday, and you had a long weekend there. That impacted shipments for a couple of days. But since then, the trend has been very much the same as we saw in June. So we're not seeing a lot of changes in boxes.","John V. Faraci","Anything else in particular, Gail, you want to hear about?","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, what you're seeing in China and maybe a little bit in uncoated freesheet and how the market may not have firmed up as I would've expected, given the magnitude of the closures.","John V. Faraci","Tom Kadien was just in China, so he can speak to [ph] that.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Yes, China's kind of moving along. I'd say it's a slow growth. It's up a couple percent, 3%, which is less than we would normally feel. I think -- and I'm speaking right now about our box markets over there. There's a lot of capacity in all markets over there right now. And growth is positive, but it's not like -- it doesn't feel like the reported 7-plus percent that they're talking about for GDP.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Gail, it's Tim. Just on the uncoated freesheet front, similar to Bill, we are seeing things from second to third quarter so far kind of moving along sideways. Having said that, we normally see a seasonal pickup as we go into August and September. So we'll have to see how that plays out. I would say, just globally, uncoated freesheet, because of a lot of factors around the world, has not had the year that we all thought it would from a demand standpoint, whether it's the Ukraine or the World Cup in Brazil. Our volumes in Brazil looked pretty flattish and anemic through the first half of the year. We thought the World Cup would help. It clearly did not. It actually hurt. So I would expect that, in the second half, there's an opportunity for things to pick up a little bit, but we'll just have to see how it plays out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question on Ilim. You have a slide that references $550 million to $600 million in fully ramped potential. Can you just give us some color on what fully ramped means? And what would be the time frame to potentially hit that? And then just maybe a related question. The U.S. and Europe put on a stricter round of sanctions on Russia. And I guess, you'd expect the Russians to reciprocate. Did the sanctions have any impact on Ilim or how you operate the business or generate earnings from the business?","John V. Faraci","Well, let me take that in 2 pieces, Anthony. Just to give you a little bit more color on how we get to the $550 million to $600 million. The big piece of that is Bratsk. Before this outage, we were running the pulp mill at about 1,200 tons a day. Coming up out of the outage, and it's only been 10 days, we've been averaging 1,700 tons a day and hit over 1,900 tons a day in the first 10 days or so. So dramatic increase. The capacity of that pulp dryer is a little over 2,000 tons a day. So that has a huge impact on the cost structure of the mill, plus you've got the incremental volume. So that, and then getting the coater up and running at Koryazhma so we can make both uncoated paper, which we're making a lot of now, we're running that at design rates; and coated paper, we'll be the only supplier of coated paper in the Russian market, are -- will be the biggest pieces of getting from where we are, which is a run rate of, call it, $450 million, to the $550 million to $600 million. In terms of what's going on in the Ukrainian sanctions, we'd need to see the details on what this last round of sanctions that kind of were in the paper that the U.S. and the Europeans are putting on. I'd say, up to now, the impact on our business has primarily been felt in Eastern Europe. Obviously, Ukraine has been impacted a lot. It wasn't a big market for us, but the Eastern European markets have been impacted. The Russian economy was already slowing down. And sanctions, we wish there were a -- we could resolve these issues. But up until now, there's been no impact on our business other than the spillover of economic activity slowing down in Eastern Europe. And while this isn't a positive -- a plus for the Russian economy, the Russian economy was slowing down well before the Ukraine issue got on the radar screen.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on containerboard. Pulp and Paper Week recently lowered medium prices by $10 a ton and has talked about weakness in recycled prices. And I was wondering if that price reduction was surprising to you and if you could maybe characterize the impact to IP.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Anthony, this is Mark Sutton. That's a great question. Let me -- before I answer that question, let me take this opportunity just to make a statement about -- as I roll into my new role. I've met many of you on the call. I look forward to spending more time with you in my new role. I've been spending time with our global business leaders and teams, getting up to speed, not only on near-term issues and what we can do for the rest of 2014 but also on the strategic front. And I'm increasingly coming away with a better feeling, an excited feeling about the opportunities we have as a company and also a better feeling in confirming my belief that we have the best people in the industry globally. So I'm excited about the new role, look forward to working with all of you that follow our industry and cover us. With respect to your question, I think the medium price changes that occurred, we view it as an isolated event and somewhat of a regional event. We haven't seen much of an impact on our business at all. As we said earlier, in Carol's part, our prices were firm through the quarter. I think you've got some issues going on that we've talked about at prior calls. As new capacity comes on, it's quite common for products to be made initially at the lower end of the technical scale. I think some of that's probably been happening, which requires some pricing behavior to get people to try it. So we don't see it as a big impact on our business at all.","Operator","Our next question is from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","First question, I guess, is more directed to you, Carol, about the Highway Trust Fund bill. You mentioned that it would maybe allow you to avoid, I guess, $800 million to $1 billion in contributions. Could you give us an idea of when that would occur? And maybe said differently or asked differently, what are your current forecasts for contributions, say, for '15, '16, maybe '17? And how would they differ?","Carol L. Roberts","Chip, yes. So as you think about the things we've talked about, we said that we expected about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion to go into the pension, and that was like '13, '14, '15; '14 '15, '16, and so it was in that time frame. We didn't put much in '13. And as you can see through the cash flow statement so far this year, we've put in a little under $300 million, and we actually made another required payment in July. So we're up a little over $300 million this year. Now we have another required contribution in '15 and '16 that would be the balance of that $1.2 billion. So we were looking at roughly $1 billion of additional required contribution in '15 and '16. That's the contribution that we won't have to put in if, indeed, the bill gets passed and written into law as it's written today. And it's all around widening the corridor and pushing out the impact of these lower interest rates. So that's the impact we have. Now what happens on that, of course, is you'll lose those tax deductions, and so there's a cash tax implication. But all in all, if you say, \"Hey, we put $1 billion less in. We're going to have to pay taxes on that,\" you can see that you're going to net $600, $700 of positive cash over this period of time. That would've gone somewhere else, now we can do something else productive with. I hope that helps.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","That's very helpful. And just as a quick follow-up. I think you said something about -- I mean, as we look at the third quarter, maybe you can quantify the Bratsk outage. I'm not sure you did. And I think something was mentioned about lower pulp prices, and it seems like softwood has sort of hung in there. I know it can be quite volatile from Ilim into China, and so maybe you could talk a little bit about how you see the softwood pulp picture.","Carol L. Roberts","Well, I could probably let Tim comment, but I think the softwood pulp, and I use the word very deliberately, average price. So it's average-to-average. So while our pulp prices are very stable now and we feel good about the markets going forward, there was some movement down in the price through the second quarter. But when you look at it average-to-average, it's lower. And relative to the Bratsk outage, we did not comment on the specific cost of that outage. We don't really disclose that for the JV, but it was a fairly good-sized outage. But the good news is, as John said, we're coming out of it running very, very well.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And do you think that better running in August and September could offset that cost? Or probably not quite?","Carol L. Roberts","Well, that has the potential. And that's why we said we think that some of the good operations could offset the pulp price, and we'll have to see about how we run the rest of the quarter. But we've been running well, and so we've been pleasantly surprised the last couple of quarters relative to Ilim's operational performance.","Operator","Next question is from Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, just a couple of questions for you. First, just going back to the MLP question. Would you be able to tell us how long you've been looking into this question? And I know Carol provided some nice detail around some of the potential challenges, around the tax leakage and restrictions on capital spend and just the time that is necessary to really be able to thoughtfully address those questions. So I mean, from your perspective, outside of what the IRS may or may not say, how long do you think it may take before IP has a better view on whether or not it could sort of overcome those obstacles?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes. So again, we'll -- we've been looking at it for quite a few months now. And as I said, we'll continue to evaluate that and also see where the IRS comes out on their requirements for MLPs. After the IRS decides, at that time, we'll have had enough time that we'll decide if we think that some proposed MLP structure has sufficient merits. And if that was the case, at that point, we'd pursue a private letter ruling. If we were to receive a private letter ruling and continue to take it [indiscernible], that's when we would make a public statement as such. But I think we're still a long ways from that between both our evaluation and really, where the IRS is. And so once again, as I said, we're going to continue to operate our business as is and continue to evaluate it and look at the complexities and the opportunity and see if there's really an opportunity for true value creation.","John V. Faraci","Yes, and that said, I mean, if you look at IP's track record and the decisions we've made over the last 6, 7 years and, most recently, the spin merge with xpedx and Unisource, which was a transaction I think we were the first ones to do, take 2 private companies and take them public, we're ready, willing and able to do things that are complicated that we think create long-term value for the company and our shareowners. So there's more work to do.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right, right. Very helpful, John and Carol. And just a question on Containerboard. Looking at industry inventory levels, relative to a 5- or 10-year average, they do seem -- or they are higher than that. I'm just curious if you can talk about where IP's inventory levels sit and how you feel about them. And then maybe looking back to last year, when we did have the inventory levels above the 10-year average, we saw the industry take some slow-back. So I'm interested in whether or not you're building in any slow-back of production to your output for the back half of the year on Containerboard?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Alex, this is Mark. I'll take the inventory question. I think, with respect to IP's inventories, we manage our supply chain very, very efficiently, and we like the shape that our inventories are in right now. We have been operating on some supply chain metrics at best-ever levels in terms of having the right stock in the right box plants. Also, in a challenging transportation environment, managing our transportation cost the best we can. So we like where our inventories are. I think overall -- and I'm not going to comment on overall industry inventories and projecting slow-backs and that part of your question. What I will say, though, is the way we run our business -- now I'll remind you again, we look at our Containerboard business as a global business. We have 3 main channels that we bring our product to market. The biggest one, obviously, is our own box business. We also serve very important customers in the U.S. open market. And then thirdly, we export a significant amount of our containerboard to parts of the world that need it and value it. A portion of that is our own box plants internationally. So when we look at how we run our containerboard system, we run it to the demand we have from our customers through all 3 of those channels. And the float between the channels allows us to optimize the business at any given period in time and adapt to seasonal demand issues. So that really drives our decision for how we run our system, and that is based on the demand of our customers.","Operator","Next question is from Al Kabili from Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","First question, I guess, is for Tim on the uncoated freesheet. The transitional costs with the Courtland closure, do we get any additional sequential benefit from that in the third quarter? It didn't look like there was much explicitly indicated in the outlook.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes. It hasn't changed a whole lot, Al, since first quarter, when we updated everyone. But it'll be less than 10 in the third quarter and probably around 5 in the fourth quarter, and then it pretty much just trails off. So we're down to the final pieces at this point.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question that I had, I guess, is switching over to Containerboard. Mark, it looks like you're talking about flattish, no real change in volume trends in July. And if I look at the outlook, it sounds like you see, on the volume end of things, CPG improving in North America, on Slide 17. And I was wondering if you could kind of clarify the flattish July trends versus sort of the commentary on the outlook, if there's some visibility there that things are getting better. Kind of how are you thinking about what are you hearing from customers from a demand perspective on the outlook in the back half?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Sure, Al. On the comments that Bill Hoel made about the box market in July, that was Corrugated Packaging. And on the outlook chart that you're looking at, that's all of our Packaging, and that CPG refers to our Consumer Packaging business, where we see improving -- slightly improving demand. And we have the capacity, with most of our outages behind us, to meet that. So that's the difference there. I think Bill covered some of it, and Carol had a piece on the slide that had our east and west breakout. So a lot of our customers inside of certain segments are still seeing their business driven as kind of a mirror image of the U.S. economy and the behavior of the consumers. There's some movement within segments. In the protein segment, some of the poultry businesses, as it's well-known, are doing better. And part of that's having to do with the challenges that the beef industry has had with corn prices. That tends to change over time. So within segments, there are different customers who have a certain product that's winning in the marketplace. We obviously try to align ourselves up with those customers. But the segments are so large and our corrugated position is so large that, over time, some of these trends tend to offset themselves.","Unknown Executive","So 1 or 2 quarters [indiscernible] press release.","John V. Faraci","The order activity in boxes for the last few weeks has been fairly decent. I think one other point that we didn't cover is that in July, we have 1 more day than we had last year or last month. So even though the daily shipments are relatively flat, you do have 1 more day, not only in the month but in the quarter, the third quarter versus second quarter. So that helps you out in overall absolute volume. But our order activity has been pretty strong. I think one of the other challenges we have in the second half of the year is the West Coast ag business. We're heavily involved in fresh fruit and vegetables in the West Coast. And with the drought conditions, it could be a little soft there. The rest of the segments that we serve, though, are relatively strong. So overall, we're more than making up for the weakness in the fresh fruit and vegetables in the second half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","First, I was hoping -- can we get an update on your dealings with the mills you had divested as part of the Temple acquisition? I think the Indy paper, I think that contract was potentially going to change at midyear.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Sure, Mark. The divested mills, there were 3 mills that we divested, just about 1 million tons. Two of them were for the creation of New-Indy Containerboard. Yes, there was a 3-year agreement to purchase tons from those divested mills and with a -- its really agreed-upon ramp-down. And so we're just progressing through that, and I think it's been working pretty well in terms of the -- where we started a couple of years ago, and it goes through the middle of next year. And so we're continuing to purchase from that mill and also the third one, which was purchased by Hood Container. And those are mostly making medium, a product that we are obviously short of after selling those mills. And so we're continuing with the current plan of ramp-down, and we'll get to the final year between this summer and next summer when the final 12 months of the agreement unfolds.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And so it's a ratable ramp-down, is the way we should think about it?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Yes. It's not a cliff drop-off in volume. That works really for all supply chains, ours as well as the companies that we sold the mills to. So we designed a smooth ramp that just allows us to perform at the most cost-effective way and the best service platform we can have to our converting plants.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, great. And...","John V. Faraci","The DOJ agreement expires in July of next year.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And second, in prior calls, you've given some guidance indications on free cash flow. Would those be pretty much unchanged as you're looking at 2014 right now? Or any adjustments?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, I think we still feel good about our free cash flow generation capability. We had some headwinds. We had headwinds in the first quarter relative to the weather. It's hard to see us getting that back. I feel like we've got a headwind around some input costs that seem to be trending a bit higher than maybe what we had expected. But the businesses continue to run well, and so it's going to be all around the second half performance. So I feel good about -- that we are going to have another strong year of that free cash flow performance that we've talked about.","Operator","Our next question is from George Staphos from Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I had a couple of questions, maybe for Carol or for Tom. Realizing that pricing is going to be a key driver of this, if we held pricing flat at today's level or second quarter average levels, if you prefer that, what kind of ramp-up would you be having us think about in terms of the consumer segment profitability versus the first half? The second question I had is, could you update us on the thoughts at Orsa, Tim, given the performance? It's obviously been improving. What type of ramp and what type of attack do you need to see to get Orsa back to a more profitable level? And I actually had one follow-on, if there's time.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","George, this is Tom. On the pricing. The first quarter announcement, I think we showed about $5 in the second -- at the end of the first quarter. I think our AGS is up another 21, since that's the average in the second quarter. And as we exit rate out of the second quarter, we still have more realization to get in the third quarter off of that first quarter increase. So it's fully in. We announced 50. We'll net less than 50 but more than 40.","Timothy S. Nicholls","George, it's Tim. On Orsa. Yes, it's gone slower than we wanted it to, but I think we have finally started getting traction. One of the things that hasn't helped has been the market. The market's actually slightly negative year-to-date versus last year. And coupled with that, we've had a few customers that, because of market conditions and their position, they've struggled, and that's impacted us. Having said that, I feel really good about what has started happening over the past couple of months on the commercial side. We've had some capital that has started going in that is allowing us to automate some of the facilities and reduce headcount. So our costs are going to start coming in line. The mills are running well. They had a better quarter in the second quarter than in the first. And I would expect another -- we took a bit of a step-up in the second quarter versus the first, I would expect a more significant one between now and the end of the year.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Tom, just a quick one, if I could. So is there a way to size what kind of improvement, overall, the segment should be if you hold your pricing where it is? And if it's not possible to guide in that way, should we assume that most of the benefit you see, second half versus first half, is pricing? And then a quick one on MLP. You can answer this just yes or no. How significant is the question of integration of the box plants with the mills in terms of understanding the complexity in terms of whether MLP structures make sense for you or not?","Carol L. Roberts","I'll do the last one first. Yes.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","And in terms of the Coated Paperboard business here in North America, the third quarter's going to be a significant ramp-up. We'll get price realization, as I outlined. But we had significant outages. We've had a tough first half, frankly. We had weather in the first quarter. We had outages in just about every month up through May, and we finally started to see our stride in the June month. We've got good backlogs coming out of the quarter. Pricing's headed up. So we'll show the earnings power of the business that we used to enjoy 1 or 2 years ago before we had to shut down Augusta PM#2. So we'll have a good third quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Chercover from D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Yes, my question was also on Bleached Board. So the momentum that we've just been discussing, that's the final implementation of the April price hike? Am I -- is it safe to assume that the July 1 hike had no impact, but we've got one pending for September 1, and that's presumably more of a Q4 event as well?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Yes, we're talking -- I've been talking about our first quarter announcement that we implemented in the second quarter, and there's a tail of realization in the third quarter. Some of our competitors have announced increases, either in June or more recently, and I'm not going to really speak to that on this call. But we see strong backlogs. Our backlogs are 5 weeks coming out of the Fourth of July holiday. And we feel pretty good going into the third quarter.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Great. And then also on the MLP, I guess it's more of an observation. It's safe to say that this is definitely a big-brainer as opposed to a no-brainer, but you guys won't proceed without a private letter ruling?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, a private letter ruling is required.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. Because I think you could assume the risk, but then if you have an adverse decision, then it's on you. But -- okay.","John V. Faraci","We'll put it back together again.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Wilde from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Mark Wilde","John, I wondered if you or Carol would want to just comment on timing of the share repurchase, particularly the new program. Because you've just -- you have moved through that first program so much more rapidly than the targets you'd laid out last year.","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, Mark. I think this is a clear example of we embarked on something and we said, \"Hey, we've got a great opportunity to provide cash back to our shareowners.\" We'd like to do it opportunistically. The key tenet is we prefer to buy the stock, obviously, at intrinsic value or below. And when we see a good opportunity to buy back stock, we've done so. We're continuing to generate strong cash, so we feel like it's an important part of our capital allocation strategy. And I think, looking backwards, you can see our actions. And getting the next $1.5 billion authorized is about being ready to continue to move in that direction. We're in a strong cash position, so we'll continue to work in this direction, and I think it's become an important part of International Paper's more strategic capital allocation program.","John V. Faraci","I would just emphasize what Carol said at the end. I mean, if you think about balanced use of cash and where we are with the balance sheet and our dividend, it's not policy, but we told the shareowners about the dividend, 30% to 40% of free cash flow, because taking share buybacks is part of the way IP deploys cash and returns cash to shareowners.","Mark Wilde","Okay. The follow-on I had was just around kind of bulk margins in Containerboard and Uncoated Free Sheet. On the Containerboard side, you talked a while back about $200 million in kind of further optimization in that business. Maybe you can give us an update on where you're at with that and what the timing is? And then also what the target would be for, ultimately, for margins in the North American Printing Paper business.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Mark, this is Mark Sutton. On the Containerboard piece of that question, and then I'll turn it over to Tim on Printing Papers. We called it an optimization plan, and we never plan to report in the detail that we did on synergies, but we are making really good progress. If you think about the performance of the business in light of this sort of flattish environment that we've had for demand, a good bit of those results are internal improvements that are part of the optimization plan. We've seen a big step-up in our ability to get our converting operations ready to perform at their full capability, and I'll just give you a couple of examples. Once we put the newly acquired mills we got from Temple onto our common supply chain system, we're really able to take cost out of our supply chain on the freight and logistics side but also in the performance inside of our converting operations. So we are operating -- almost on a monthly basis, we're setting new best-evers for waste management and the throughput and other metrics we use to measure productivity, are now on a much steeper ramp of improvement. And a lot of that has to do with sort of running this large mill system in the most efficient way possible from a total delivered cost standpoint, not just a mill cost standpoint. So we're pleased with the progress against that $200 million. And not a lot of it was based on a great market, so the volume not materializing isn't really hurting us. It was based on running better and reducing cost in our mills. We've had one whole set of outages that we've done on the new mills, and we've implemented some of the changes. We've got to do another round of that to get some of the cost reduction projects fully implemented. And I think we'll be definitely on track to meet and probably exceed our optimization target. I'll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy S. Nicholls","On the Printing Papers side, it's probably difficult to forecast margins in a declining market. Having said that, we feel pretty good about where we are. We've got 2 specialty mills that we're still working on cost optimization opportunities as well as mix opportunities. And we've got 2 large commodity mills where we're doing the same thing. So there's -- the bulk of it's going to come from cost and mix, and we'll have to see what demand does. But clearly, with Courtland behind us, we move up to mid- to slightly above mid-teens, and then we'll have to see where that goes for 2015 as we look at market declines for the rest of the year. But there's still good opportunities around changing what runs through our mills and continuing to refine that. And there's very good opportunities on the cost side.","Operator","Our next question is from Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on the 430,000 tons or so at Valliant that you could hypothetically bring back online, and kind of the decision-making process around that. And then like what the costs associated would be and the benefits that you would expect.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Debbie, this Mark. First of all on Valliant. We haven't made a decision on Valliant. We've talked about it on prior calls as a way to potentially optimize our capacity. And as I mentioned earlier, Valliant's a very valuable asset as we look at our overall business. We talked earlier on the call about the divestiture of 1 million tons of containerboard. We don't talk about it a whole lot, but our European and other international box businesses use over 2.5 million tons of containerboard, and that's part of that global channel selection I talked about. We've increased, over the last 4 years, by over 0.25 million tons our shipments from IP mills in the U.S. to our international box plants. There's more opportunity there. We still purchase over 1 million tons in the international market from third-party producers. We've also got grades inside of our Containerboard system that are very attractive, but they're not containerboard, and that business has grown. Most of those products go into the building materials market. And so when you look at all the moving parts, a machine like Valliant in a mill that's already running with an efficient use of fixed cost would be a potential winner for our system. So when and if we make a decision, we'll definitely come out and communicate it. But it's all wrapped around making the containerboard and some of these other specialty products that we need to serve our customers. So Valliant's an existing machine, as you know, so the cost to bring it back up is part getting things maintained and back in shape to run and then part the shutdown several years ago, and there's some cost efficiency that we can do if we were to start it up to run it at a lower cost, better energy usage and so forth. So stay tuned on that. We definitely are looking at Valliant, but not only Valliant. There's other opportunities we have in our system to continue to optimize it.","Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up just relates to your -- what you referenced. I just was wondering if you could comment on the overall health of demand in the regions where you compete. And then I think there've been some pricing increases for containerboard, and whether or not you expect that to roll through on your corrugated box pricing.","Mark Stephan Sutton","So on regional corrugated box demand, I think we made some earlier comments. I think John mentioned the European business. We're outperforming the market in our European business, which, again, is Western European kind of industrial markets and then the Mediterranean region for agricultural markets. And we're seeing slightly better demand in that region for the market, and we're doing a little bit better than that. There has been some price announcements and movements on recycled linerboard in Europe. That's still yet to be determined. Some of those were just announced. But overall, we've seen stable pricing. Some isolated cases of prices moving up and down in a specific country or a specific region, and that tends to be directly related to, more or less, supply showing up at any moment in time. But overall, I'd say demand in our global regions -- I think Tom mentioned what's happening in Asia, growth, but not quite as much as we had seen in the past. And Tim talked about Orsa. But stable demand in most of the regions, and pricing is relatively stable. So Corrugated Packaging business is, obviously, one we like, and we're looking forward to seeing further improvement.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Carol, just one more follow-up on the MLP issue. Setting aside the other issues you discussed, which I know are important, which you can't practically set aside, do you have a view regarding the multiple uplift that would come from dropping some of your virgin mills into an MLP structure? And whether the MLP multiple premium, over your current multiple that exists today, is likely to persist for years into the future?","Carol L. Roberts","So as we think about what really is a multiple expansion, it really has to be something underneath that's value-creating, that changes the value of the business. And the one that is clear is the tax advantage, if you can capture it and hold it and you don't lose it in some other way. So clearly, in a partnership arrangement, it's a pass-through, so you eliminate one level of taxation. But that's a price that's specific, that you can quantify. Once again, the key issue is, is can you maintain that price and not lose it to other complexities or other places that, that price is lost? Outside of that, I probably wouldn't comment on relative to multiple or margin -- or multiple expansion in the rest of the business.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. No, sure. And Mark, just one on containerboard export markets. I know you were just talking about Europe specifically, but can you characterize the state of the export markets? And are they appreciably different than they were 3 months, 6 months, 9 months ago?","Mark Stephan Sutton","I would say not appreciably different. There is -- we have seen some additional supply, mostly from the U.S., in some markets, which is not uncommon. And I think we've mentioned it before, probably related to a little bit of the capacity start-ups. But other than that, we see pretty stable markets. Most of what we export is kraft liner, and those segments have done most of the switching between recycle and virgin that they can do. So they tend to buy because they need it. And so not a big, significant difference in any of those time increments you mentioned.","John V. Faraci","Let me wrap up here. We had a solid quarter. We feel good about the quarter. We think of success as a journey at International Paper. We're far from done. We're generating strong, sustainable free cash flow. And I think, importantly, for all of our shareowners, we're deploying that cash in a way to maximize shareowner value. And as I said before with the Q&A, all-in as we look to the future, we like what's ahead. We're ready for both the opportunities and the challenges. So thank you.","Jay Royalty","So thanks, John, and thanks, again, to all of you for taking the time to join us this morning.

My name is Phyllis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Glenn Landau, you may begin your conference.","Glenn Landau","Thanks, Phyllis, and good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are John Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During the call, as always, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation.","We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information, a reconciliation of which you'll find in -- on our website, and that reconciliation will be to our U.S. GAAP financial measures, as always.","Our website also contains our fourth quarter 2012 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. So lastly, given our expanded disclosure around our Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John Faraci.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everybody. Yes, let me just start out by saying 2012 was another milestone year for International Paper. I think as all of you know, International Paper's cash flow story in 2012 was an all-time record in terms of cash from operations for International Paper, $3 billion.","Some of the drivers. You know the story around Temple. The synergies had been far greater than we anticipated, and we realized them far faster. We've also successfully and fully implemented a price increase in our Containerboard and box business. That didn't have a huge impact in 2012 but will have a pretty significant impact in 2013.","Now looking at Slide 7, 2012 is the third year in a row where we've earned returns in excess of the cost of capital, and what I think the last 3 years is fairly characterized as less than robust through mid-cycle demand environment. We reduced debt by $2 billion on 2012; increased our dividend by 14%, with more runway on the dividend ahead of us; and last but most important, and I'll cover this at the end but I just want to say at the outset, we've made significant progress on our strategic initiatives that create more earnings and cash flow upside for International Paper, 2013 and 2014, even in a more-of-the-same macroeconomic environment.","So with that as a summary, Carol, let's turn over to you to cover some of the fourth quarter and full year.","Carol L. Roberts","Sure. So if I take you to Page 6, you can just see the financial snapshot of the company. And you can see that revenues were very strong year-over-year, up $2 billion to $28 billion. We did have some lost earnings compression associated with lower pulp and export pricing. Realizations were down, but we feel like the bottom has been reached on that, and things are stabilizing. So moving forward, it should be very good. As John said, you can see that we continue to generate a very high level of sustainable free cash flow.","John referenced 7. You can see it. We had very good return on invested capital, and we had our third year now of return on invested capital above our cost of capital. And importantly, as we move towards 2013, we see another step change in our performance on this metric, which should be our best returns and the highest in, really, decade.","If I move you to Slide 8, let's take a look at the financial bridge from 2011 to 2012. I would frame our results as solid. And more importantly, the progress that we made integrating Temple-Inland in 2012 was meaningfully earnings accretive in under 12 months. Importantly, this has built a strong foundation for steadily improving, as well as less cyclical earnings for the company going forward. While that slower global growth environment did take its toll on our pricing in pulp and our consumer grades, really it impacted our export shipments across our product lines. As I said, I really believe the worst from that is behind us, and we've seen pulp market stabilized, come off the bottom, and export market in containerboard, importantly, have recovered nicely in the second half. It was, all said, an excellent year of execution across our global operations. Mill performance more than offset the ramp-up costs that we experienced with Franklin and also with the new paper machine at the Sun JV. We did have lower average input costs that did help the company offset some significant noncash, non-repeat of LIFO and standards reevaluation swings from '11 to '12. And simply put, we have positive $50-ish million in '11 to a negative $50-ish million in '12, creating about $100 million swing in earnings.","In summary, repeating John's message, we ended '12 stronger than we began, having made significant progress on many runway earnings, driver projects that John is going to talk about at the end, which positions the company very well for 2013.","Relative to the balance sheet, as you can see on Slide 9, we made significant progress reducing our debt a further $400 million in the fourth quarter, and that brought our total debt pay down post to Temple-Inland acquisition to a $1.9 billion. The discount rate used to calculate our projected benefit obligation end of the year, down about 100 basis points, and that did result in a larger pension gap by $1.4 billion. But we still remain on track to meet our Moody's debt target of less than 3x adjusted EBITDA by the end of '13 through a continued debt reduction. And as I have shared before, the required cash contribution for the pension plan in '13 will be less than $40 million.","Moving to the fourth quarter, as John already shared, we exited the year strong in Industrial Packaging, with our synergy run rate of $360 million per year of synergies from the acquisition in the quarter while also fully capturing the $50 containerboard increase. We did see $29 per ton on average in our box business versus the third quarter.","We did, however, experience higher costs in the quarter. Uncharacteristically for us, we did experience weaker mill operation, and we had a fairly disrupted supply chain in our Industrial Packaging business in North America due to very low containerboard inventories, as well as we had some impact in the Northeast to our box business and xpedx from Hurricane Sandy.","The Sun JV was ramping up in the fourth quarter. That also had a slight adverse impact. Kind of ramping up on the cost equation, along with higher inputs, this resulted in lower earnings by probably about $80 million in the quarter. As I would categorize, I just wouldn't call IP at its best in the fourth quarter, but roughly maybe $40 million of that is recoverable in the first quarter, so it bodes well for the coming year.","Going to Slide 11, bridging from the previous quarter, we, as we said, earned $0.69 per share in the fourth quarter, and that's versus $0.81 per share in the third quarter. In summary, the increased earnings came from higher prices and the lower tax rate, which was offset by higher operational costs, weaker equity earnings from Ilim and the planned increase in outage expense, which accounted for $0.11 in the quarter.","Let me take you now to Slide 12 and once again look at our financial snapshot. Revenues were strong in the fourth quarter, up sequentially versus the third quarter and greater than 10% higher versus the fourth quarter of last year. Obviously, it's primarily driven by Temple-Inland. And as we said earlier, we generated strong cash from operations in the quarter, over $760 million, less our capital spending of $380 million, for free cash flow of nearly $390 million in the quarter, which is very strong for a fourth quarter performance.","Moving to 13, in terms of downtime, we did have more scheduled maintenance outages than we had good seasonal demand out of our Corrugated box business. And this meant lower market-related downtime to effectively match our supply with our customers' demand in TIN IPG. As a result of that, there's significantly less market-related downtime but importantly, a net impact of approximately 150,000 tons less total downtime versus the third quarter in our containerboard mill system. The business worked to rebuild inventories prior to what's coming up, a very heavy maintenance outage scheduled in the first quarter of '13.","Consumer Packaging, on the other hand, did continue to experience soft domestic demand and weaker export markets in the fourth quarter. We've been looking at that business, and this resulted in the decision announced last week to permanently shut down one machine at the Augusta mill, with an effective capacity of around 140,000 tons of coated paperboard. This closure will balance our supply with our outlook for demand for coated paperboard, and it will allow the remaining systems to operate more efficiently. Our expectation is that we will run the new system full in '13.","And finally, for the eighth straight quarter, our papers and pulp business in North America continued to run full supported by higher export shipments.","Moving to inputs on Slide 14. Costs were up in the quarter by $27 million or $0.04 per share and was pretty much spread across all the segments, with higher costs from wood, energy, with gas coming off a very historical low and chemicals driving most of the increase. On balance, OCC, while trending up throughout the quarter, averaged roughly flat with the third quarter.","Moving on to the businesses, let's -- on 15, take a closer look at Industrial Packaging. While the containerboard and box price realization that I mentioned added about $80 million, while lower market related downtime and some seasonally stronger demand in Europe added another $18 million versus the third quarter. As I stated earlier, we did have weaker mill operation, and we had a very stressed supply chain due to tight inventories in our box plant, as well as the interruptions from Hurricane Sandy. This drove costs higher in the quarter, and they were partially offset by an insurance settlement that we got in Europe of $16 million related to the May 2012 earthquake in Northern Italy. Additionally, maintenance costs were up $44 million in the third quarter and -- from inputs primarily, as we talked, wood, energy and chemicals. And that added another $18 million incremental headwind.","I think 16, once again, really sums it up, though. With all that said and despite the impact of this operational issue, heavy maintenance outages, Slide 16 shows that our North American business continues to compare very favorably to the best of the competitive set. And once again, this quarter, it further demonstrates our belief in our structural advantage versus competition in this space.","A big reason for that is what you see on Slide 17, which is the synergy chart. And as we said, the business will achieve the current target of $400 million on a run-rate basis in the first quarter of '13, which is essentially $100 million better and 1 year ahead of the original plan. No doubt, an impressive achievement and importantly, not the end, as Mark Sutton and the team moves from integration to optimization in '13.","Here's the synergy chart that you've seen, and you can see where they're coming from. You can see that the overhead, the box efficiency and the sourcing buckets are essentially a target. We have some remaining opportunity in the paper machines and the supply chain optimization, and those will be largely achieved in the first quarter. Of course, this sets the stage for further improvement in the business as we continue to optimize that 13 million-ton system next year.","Page 19 is an exciting new opportunity that we've got. It's our newest venture in industrial packaging in Brazil, depicted by the pictures on Slide 19. This is our Orsa international joint venture, and we are now in full integration mode of closing earlier this month. Although it's still very early, we are certainly energized by what we've seen to-date, and we see incremental opportunities where we can improve the efficiency, expand the production capability, leveraging our global mill experience, and particularly our mill experience in Brazil, as well as our vast corrugated packaging knowledge. And this provides us an opportunity to take advantage and participate in this growing market.","There'll be more to come next quarter. We plan to give a more in-depth view of this year's potential, both in terms of our earnings in EBITDA. I do want to comment that we will be reporting to start with a one month lag. So for the first quarter results, it will be essentially 2 months worth of results.","Moving to Consumer Packaging. Segment operating profits were $39 million in the fourth quarter of '12 compared to $67 million in the third quarter. This was a result of weaker price and mix in the domestic and export markets, continued unplanned market-related downtime in North America and some ramp-up costs associated with the Sun JV. We also have higher outage-related maintenance expenses quarter-over-quarter and negatively impact results. And as I previously stated, we have announced the closure of the machine in Augusta, which will help this business manage their costs more effectively going forward.","In Printing Papers, on Slide 21, Printing Papers also experienced some seasonally weaker export margins, as well as higher planned outage-related maintenance spending quarter-over-quarter, resulting in operating profits in the fourth quarter of $147 million versus $201 million in the third quarter of '12.","With that said, I think 22 is an interesting chart, and it takes a look at our full year-over-year change for our global Printing Papers uncoated freesheet sales volume in each region. Our global volume is up just over 2% across all segments and geographies compared to the same period last year, clearly outpacing the global market that we view as essentially flat in this combination of these regions. So uncoated freesheet demand is down, in line with expectations in North America, the emerging market businesses are growing at or above market, and we've been able to take advantage of our global market access to increase exports out of North America as opportunities arise. Example is we get the chance to fill void with current customers. And for example, export volume from Brazil is repatriated back to Latin America to meet that growing local customer demand. But this kind of synergistic opportunity to leverage our global footprint really differentiates IP's paper business from our regional competitors and we believe will continue to afford us advantages in the medium and the long term.","On the cost savings front, in Brazil, this is a picture of a newly installed biomass boiler that is online and fully operational since the beginning of January. This virtually eliminates our consumption of fossil fuels and meaningfully reduces our purchased electricity. So this moves us to a renewable fiber source that we can get both from our own and from adjacent sustainably managed forests. This project alone will result in reduced costs of approximately $6 million to $7 million of savings per quarter.","Moving on to xpedx on 24. xpedx is the company's North American distribution business, and we reported operating profits in the fourth quarter of $11 million compared to $24 million in the third quarter. Positive, our quarter-over-quarter, we did have modest volume improvement, primarily in packaging was great. But these were more than offset by lower commercial print margins, higher operating costs in the quarter.","On 25, let's talk a bit about our Ilim Joint Venture, where slightly higher pulp and containerboard prices were more than offset by seasonally higher woods and energy costs in the quarter. The IP equity earnings were further impacted positively by an after-tax benefit of $6 million in the current quarter. And this resulted in total after-tax equity earnings of $8 million in the fourth quarter compared to $33 million in the third quarter of 2012. But what's important about Ilim is looking forward with the completion and commissioning of our projects at Bratsk and Koryazhma, that remains our top priority for the first quarter of '13, with commercial startup planned for the second quarter. And these projects just generate a lot of potential and runway for the company going forward.","So summarizing, on 26, recapping, it illustrates that we did deliver on many fronts solid results in the fourth quarter, led by strong Industrial Packaging success not only with the Temple-Inland integration but implementing the containerboard and box increase. Offsetting these gains, as we talked about, we had some uncharacteristically weaker operating performance due to a number of issues: tight supply chain in IPG and higher planned outage expenses and input costs.","Before I move on to the outlook, let me just talk about capital allocation and balanced use of cash on 27. I think this chart and this discussion will underline our commitment to a balanced use of cash that drives shareholder value. First, we returned more cash to our shareholders in the form of a dividend increase in the fourth quarter of 14%. We do plan to review our dividend annually and continue to adjust in line with our principal around 30% to 40% of mid-cycle free cash flow. We will deliver on our dividend growth commitment as earnings and free cash flow grows. Next, we did successfully execute $1.4 billion in capital spending. That is $100 million below guidance, and that did include about $400 million on strategic projects, primarily Franklin and Sun, and $200 million in high-returning cost savings projects. The biomass boiler in Brazil is a great example of that. And this investment will definitely drive incremental earnings in '13. As John and I have both said, we aggressively reduced debt on the balance sheet post the closing of Temple-Inland by $1.9 billion. And we said we would continue to reduce debt into '13.","And lastly, we reinvested in our businesses selectively. We invested in our core segment of Corrugated Packaging not only with the acquisition of Temple-Inland at the beginning of the year but in fast-growing regions, with our investments in Turkey and Brazil.","In terms of capital spending going forward, we have revised down our outlook for the '12 to '15 timeframe by $400 million to an average of $1.4 billion per year, and this is due to factoring in the reduced regulatory spending that we see that will be required from Boiler MACT in this period.","So let me move now to Slide 29 and provide you more detail on our outlook for the first quarter. Looking ahead to the first quarter of '13, we expect seasonally weaker volume in our European, Russian and Brazilian paper businesses and stable demand across North America. Moving to pricing, we expect the full benefit of our fourth quarter box price increase to be realized in the quarter, and this will be partially offset by some seasonal mix in Brazil, essentially related to a mix of more export. In operations, as I've said, we should see the impact of improved operations across the mill businesses as supply chain and conditions are definitely improved and onetime issues in the fourth quarter do not repeat. We do expect that we'll have further lower costs at Franklin and the full impact of the biomass boiler in Brazil, and this will also provide additional tailwind. As to inputs, we view this as a headwind. We expect higher OCC wood and energy costs, and this is probably worth an incremental $50 million to $60 million in the coming quarter. And lastly, we do have another heavy maintenance outage quarter, so our quarter-on-quarter expenses will remain fairly high, with only a modest decrease of $7 million in the quarter.","So with that, now let me summarize, on 30, the first quarter outlook. The first quarter is essentially a seasonally slower quarter relative to demand. While we will see the full benefit of the North American box increase, as well as the improved performance that I've talked about, that this will be offset by higher inputs and some higher taxes. And we can talk about taxes for a moment. As you'll note, our tax rate is going to move up from the fourth quarter to the first quarter from 21% to 25%, and both of these remain well below our normalized level of 31% to 33%. The impact in the first quarter of '13 is due to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which actually signed into law this month, therefore the impact of that will be felt in 2013.","So at this point, let me turn it back over to you, John.","John V. Faraci","Okay. Thanks, Carol. I'm on Slide 31 now here, the map. And what I want to do, before I get into talking about 2013 and some of the -- revisit the strategic initiatives that I referenced at the beginning, just to give you a sense of how we see the world where International Paper operates, this map shows the 6 global economies that are important to International Paper in kind of 4 businesses: paper, corrugated packaging, coated board and pulp. And as you can see, when you look at all these, overall, we're forecasting 3.5% of global growth, which is consistent with most of what you see forecasters are thinking now, with North America being a lot slower than that and the rest of the world being better, especially places like Russia, India and China.","So let us move on to the 2013 outlook, still all about cash. And as I said, I just want to reiterate, International Paper is a cash flow story. We're going to see the full impact of pricing that we've gotten. In fact, we've -- we're just about there now, in January, on our containerboard and box business. That is $400 million plus. The strategic initiatives, which I'll come to in a minute, are going to add about $350 million to $400 million of improvement in the year. And when you take in modest global growth, all that adds up to, roughly, $1 billion of overall improvement.","There are some headwinds. We've got some cost headwinds of a couple hundred million dollars, so we expect another record year in terms of cash generation for International Paper. And as Carol said, what we'll be doing is returning some of that cash as it gets produced to shareholders and also reducing our debt.","So let me take a minute -- I'm on Page 33 now -- Slide 33, take a minute before the Q&A, just to go over the strategic initiatives. I think this is one of the things that makes International Paper different and gives us the earnings and cash flow runway from not only 2013 but 2014, even in a less than mid-cycle economic environment. So what you see here are the initiatives, the timing of when they're going to impact International Paper. And the pie chart on the right is meant to reflect the percent of the total impact that we expect to realize in 2013. So you can see it's just starting off with Temple. We're going to be there on synergies. With the synergy windows basically at the end of this year, we're well beyond our initial synergy target. We're going to realize that all in 2013.","There are others like Olmuksa, which is the buyout of our joint venture in Turkey, and the Orsa packaging business that we just acquired in January in Brazil. They're going to add to International Paper earnings in 2013, so you see those as whole grain. Others like Franklin, the pulp line, we should be about 60% to 70% fluff pulp this year, 100% fluff pulp next year, so we'll see the full impact, we'll see an impact in 2013, which will be positive, and we'll see the full impact next year.","APPM and Sun are really more about 2014 than they are about 2013. And all those projects added up represent, as I said, $350 million to $400 million of EBITDA potential. That's about 40% of the total impact of those projects. So you can see we've got a big, big chunk coming in this year and more to follow in 2014.","And finally, down below the EBIT line but in our equity earnings, Ilim is going to become more positive in 2013 even with the continued weak pulp market because we're in the commissioning phase, we'll be in a startup phase, commissioning phase, both at Koryazhma, where we're adding a new paper machine, we're running the converting equipment, and perhaps, we're adding new fiber line. We're now running the recovery boiler on liqueur. And the full impact of those projects will be realized in 2014, when they're both up and running full. And what all that means for Ilim is another $400 million of improvement at mid-cycle. Not all of that will come in to equity earnings because we got increased depreciation, we've got increased interest with the debt we've taken on, but it does mean that in 2014, a big portion of that will be flowing through equity earnings and potentially in dividends. So when you add all that up, what we're thinking about is close to $2 billion of free cash flow as we move through 2013 and 2014, which we're pretty excited about.","So I'm going to stop right there and open it up to questions. I have most of my colleagues here with me in Memphis, so I think we're ready.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","First question is you mentioned on the improvement on Slide 33 from all the projects and that $350 million to $450 million on a mid-cycle basis would be just 40% of the improvement. Can you just clarify, that is the amount you would expect and hope to see in 2013, and all the improvement from these projects would actually be north of $1 billion plus whatever Ilim gives you. Is that the right way to read that?","John V. Faraci","Yes. Yes.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. And then next question is you mentioned, Carol, that the downtime in the fourth quarter in containerboard -- or in particularly not the downtime, the lack of downtime was to build inventories ahead of the seasonal downtime you're about to take. And I was just wondering if you could give us a gauge as to what the inventory increase was for your system in the fourth quarter, and even if you have a look at January.","Carol L. Roberts","I'll let Mark answer that question, Chip.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Chip, great question on inventory. We have entered the quarter with very lean inventories, as Carol mentioned. And we had a couple operating problems that made it difficult for us to build the inventories we needed. So we ended the fourth quarter trying to build inventory to prepare for our outages in -- actually in the first 2 quarters, and we didn't quite reach our target. We did build some finally through December but not enough, so we're working toward getting our inventories in shape in January so we could execute the outages that we have first half.","John V. Faraci","Yes, I'll just add there, Chip, on a 13 million-ton system, when you have supply chain problems, the numbers get big pretty quickly. So we want to rectify that and -- so we don't have those supply chain issues internally with customers going forward.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. I mean, can we have seen like 100,000 tons, I mean, given the size your system, increase since the low point in September?","Mark Stephan Sutton","We would have loved to have seen that to prepare for, like I said, really the first half of the year upwards of 60% of our outage, but we didn't have anywhere near that number.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And then just the last question is, when you look at the goal of getting the total debt including pension below 3x, and you sort of mentioned that you can sort of see getting there at the end of the year. I guess a couple things, one is, I mean, the year is only a month old, but it's fascinating to see that the probably 25 basis points, I'm guessing, or 20 of that 100-basis-point hit you took that created that, I guess, $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion increase in the pension underfunded position. That a part of that has reversed and your assets have gone up. I mean, if you kind of looked at this in realtime, I guess, is that you're already seeing that reverse. And do you feel you need to get below that 3 point before you would, say, consider buying back shares?","Carol L. Roberts","Chip, I think what's important is using the cash in the most effective and prudent way that we can. We'll continue to evaluate debt pay-down, as well as other uses, as you've mentioned. Dividend's a priority, and share buybacks, certainly, are something that we would consider.","John V. Faraci","Yes, Chip, what we said consistently is our objective is not to fund the -- fully fund the pension plan with a discount rate at 50-year lows. That's not [indiscernible]. Certainly, we want to get the balance sheet debt down to less than 3. We're conscious of the pension obligation. We've got in our cash flow planning, we got plenty of cash to put in the pension plan as we need to. As Carol said, we don't need to put -- it's a modest amount for 2014. So interest rates, you're right, I think it will go a long way into helping us fund the pension plan, and we're not going to do it all with cash.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","It's great to see that your market, really, of downtime in containerboard was down by basically 1\/6 of what it was. But why even take downtime if you had the supply-chain disruptions, or you just didn't realize that you were that lean?","Mark Stephan Sutton","This is Mark. That's part of the issue. All of the lack of order or market downtime was taken very early in the quarter. Usually, we expect a little more seasonal decline in the fourth quarter, and it wasn't really happening, so we unwound the planned lack of order downtime early in the quarter. And everything looked good until we had a couple of reliability issues, and that resulted in us having some additional costs, mainly in freight and in waste in the box plants because we were sourcing board from less-than-optimal mills. But we really got the lack of order downtime out of the way early in the quarter, really in October.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And we know you're taking some maintenance, Q1. Can you discuss, I guess, just your order trends in the first few weeks of January?","Mark Stephan Sutton","For the box business in North America or in the U.S., the order trends look about what -- like we expected. So for us, we've been tracking probably a little lower than the overall market and in the box market in the U.S., and that's kind of what we're seeing. But I'll remind you that the way we run the business is we try to maximize our potential through all 3 channels, the North American box business, but also the open market and the export market for containerboard. And we'll constantly move between those 3 segments to optimize the business.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And why do you think you're running a little below the North American trend? Is it just that you're turning away bad business?","Mark Stephan Sutton","I think if you think about what we've been through in the year, obviously, we took on a lot of new business with the form of Temple business. There's a lot of integration activities on the commercial side. Not all of that business met our objectives in terms of capability or economics. And so in order to make improvements in the business, we have to make choices, and we've been doing that and will probably continue to do that for a period of time until we have the best mix for International Paper and the best service for our customers. So it's not anything that we are alarmed by. It's part of the process of optimizing the new company that we built.","John V. Faraci","Another point, Steve, is we're under-weighted in durables relative to maybe the overall market and overweighted in nondurables. So as you get the flow in impact to housing, which is going to be significant on the durable side, we're going to be -- we're underrepresented there now, and we're probably going to grow that durables segment over time selectively.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You have a helpful slide showing your returns over the past decade, and maybe 2 questions there. When you think big picture about the dip in returns from 2011 to 2012, should we think about that as being primarily driven by the heavy lifting around the Temple integration and maybe a slightly larger capital base? And then second question, when you think about moving those returns higher in 2013, what are the businesses or geographies within IP that really have the most potential to improve their return on capital in 2013 relative to where they were in 2012?","Carol L. Roberts","Anthony, this as Carol. I'll just take the first part on that. Yes, the dip you see in '12 was certainly the fact that we made a big investment. But when you see the rebound that's going to happen in 2013, it's going to show how successful and accretive and synergistic the Temple-Inland acquisition is going to be to the financial performance of the company.","John V. Faraci","And some of the big levers, Anthony, in terms of where returns are going to improve, Industrial Packaging in North America for sure, with a full year of merger benefits now and a full year of the implementation of the pricing -- of the containerboard and box price increase, that's big. In Latin America, the returns in Brazil get better because we're selling more paper in the region, where the EBITDA per ton or the EBIT per ton is significantly higher than it is for the rest of the world. And that market's growing. And we got the boiler project in India. And we paid the price to get into India, and we see a lot of improvement. We can sell all we can make, which is something you can't say about the paper business necessarily in North America, but got good growth there. So India is still small. But those are 3 of other places, 1 very large, Industrial Packaging; 1 smaller, where we see a lot of upside for improving return on invested capital.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And you mentioned the North American paper business, and you had pretty positive performance globally. But when you look at -- I was wondering if you could talk about how maybe volumes in 4Q trended versus your expectations. And we seemed to have a pretty bad industry number in December, if you have any kind of observations on that. I saw that you have like a 3% volume decline assumption for 2013, and maybe if you could just kind of comment on those trends.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Anthony, it's Tim Nicholls. Actually, in the fourth quarter, I think as the quarter started, we felt relatively good about our volume levels. And they held up well in October and the first half of November as well, and then you always get the seasonal downtick around Thanksgiving. But I think what was notable, first part of December looked very good, and then I think probably around the 20th of the month, the weekend before Christmas, everything shut down, and they pretty much shut down for the year. We heard that consistently across all segments of customers, and I think it was probably a combination of what was going on in Washington, as well as everybody wanted to run the inventory levels down as much as they could or had sufficient inventories they felt to hold them over. So I don't read too much into the December number. I think it's overstated. And when you look at this year, the 3% is really not our forecast for sale, though we agree with it, it's what third parties are saying. So it's a blended rate between PPPC and RISI. But I think when you look at volume for total year 2012, a little bit higher than the 3% to 4% that we think on a secular basis. But I think secularly, we're right in line where we think we should be. And cyclically, we didn't get as much help from the economy as we thought we would.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A question for Mark Sutton, just to start. Mark, it looks like you had about 570,000 tons of market downtime for the full year. And I assume in 2013, you're going to get some more operational benefits from integrating the Temple mill. Is there any reason with that kind of slack in the system and sort of low growth scenario in front of us for the next 12 months why you wouldn't look at making some permanent moves on the supply side?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Well, it's a good question because we honestly don't want to take that much lack of order downtime if we don't have to. But you got to remember what I've said earlier about the 3 channels of export, open market and domestic box, and the fact that we have these off-take agreements from the mills we divested. When we look at all of those moving parts, we believe we're going to need the containerboard that our system can currently make going forward. So while this might be a little slack in the near term as we move through those divested mill offtakes and as we look at the global growth in the containerboard. And as I said earlier, we don't intend to track below the market forever in the box. We just have to get in the right segments and optimize the business. I think we're in pretty good shape. We would have to believe, Mark, in a real structural change in the demand profile for us to be considering permanent capacity adjustments.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, that's fair. Those offtakes are pretty important. Can you remind us just generally how long those offtakes run for?","Mark Stephan Sutton","It's a 3-year agreement, from -- starting from the summer of 2012, and it goes down in commitment volume each year.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, John, a question for you. Can you just talk with us, generally, about the potential for kind of further acquisition or growth initiatives over the next year or 2? I'm particularly curious in some of the offshore markets, say, the Packaging business in Russia or that packaging business in India. You've talked about, particularly in India, wanting to grow in packaging.","John V. Faraci","Well, International Paper is not an M&A story. We're through the transformation plan. That's over. We've rebuilt the company. It looks different, and it's got a lot of performance potential upside in the existing assets we have. So I'll just say that to reinforce that we're not out saying we have to do things to improve International Paper, we've got plenty on our plate that we've put in place over the last several years. India, we think, is going to be an exciting market for International Paper for a long time. That doesn't mean we're going to be doing a whole lot of things in 2013 other than continue to make improvements at APPM. We are going to generate a lot of cash. Our priorities are to use that in a balanced way. And if there aren't opportunities to reinvest in some of our strategic businesses, we'll return more to shareholders. But International Paper is not M&A-driven at this point, and we've put in place what we need to make International Paper a much better company. And we're excited about the runway for '13 and '14 with just what we have.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. The last question I have was for Carol. I wondered if you could just help us with the ramp-up that we might see from Ilim in the second half of the year? And if you can give us any color on this sort of next phase of Ilim build-out that Paul Herbert had talked about publicly about 15 months ago?","John V. Faraci","Let me take that one, Mark. The -- we'll be starting out -- start with Koryazhma. That's where we're putting a paper machine in that we moved from Scotland. That will be starting up in March. Behind -- we're already running the converting equipment. Behind that, we've got a coater going in, in the second quarter, so we'll be able to make 50,000 to 100,000 tons of coated paper. We're the only producer of coated paper in the Russia market. Going back to Bratsk, that's a pulp line will start up probably late in the first quarter. We're going to do that right because of what's going on with the markets in China. And you'll see those facilities ramp up. The pulp lines will be a little shorter than the paper machine because we've got to get all the grades qualified. And we should be at full ramp as we come out of '13 into '14. The objective at Ilim is going to be to pay down some of the debt that the joint venture has taken on to fund the projects. But we're going to have a whole lot more debt capacity because, as I said, we'll add $400 million of EBITDA to an already pretty healthy Ilim at mid-cycle. And there are some possibilities, as Paul talked about. We have -- the Ilim board hasn't made any decision but they'll be talking about that as -- probably as we move out to '13 into '14. But the priority of Ilim is get those projects started up and start to give Ilim some more headroom on its balance sheet, so that it's got some options. Plus we got an opportunity to increase the dividend. All those things are available to us.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. It sounds like, John, in summary, we shouldn't expect a lot of benefit in the second half of '13 just from equity contribution standpoint, that's really more 2014, is that correct?","John V. Faraci","Correct. Because you've got increased interest and increased depreciation which is going to kind of offset most of the EBIT improvement we expect to see if pricing stays where it is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, I guess I had a question for you and the team. As we look at the incremental runway drivers that you call that in total worth $350 million to $450 million, what confidence level would you place on the lower and upper bounds and other discrete factors you are risk adjusting for that provide the range of outcomes in your guidance, what could you share with us in terms of how those numbers -- or how that performance, rather, could move over the year?","John V. Faraci","Well, just starting at the top. We have a lot of confidence in what we see with -- in industrial packaging with Temple, I said that the price increase is in. The -- we have -- we know what we got to do to get more synergies. And we can't wait to get through the synergies and turn optimization, so a lot of confidence on that. That's a big number. Franklin, we basically sold a lot of fluff pulp, but we need to qualify it. So our customers are waiting for us to qualify the pulp. We're going to have more Tier 1 and Tier 2 customers than we thought, which is better margins in Q3. A lot of confidence on that. xpedx has made a huge amount of progress on the warehouse side and the purchasing side. It's all then offset by what's happening on the revenue side and print. So xpedx has been treading water, but if they haven't been working hard on what they've been doing, we wouldn't be treading water. Our Mogi boiler is up and running. I'd say that's in the bank. We've got to work through the excess capacity that exists in China around the coated board business, as you've seen before when China's markets, since they're all growing, when they grow, they can take and absorb capacity pretty quickly. And I think the Chinese economy has kind of seen its a slow point. So Olmuksa and -- Olmuksa has been operating for a decade, so we know that. Orsa's new, but we like what we see so far. It's in the early days. Ilim is -- we're operating in Russia, it's going to take some time to get those ramped up. Hopefully they come on faster, but we know how to do this, we've done it before. So I'd say, all in, we're pretty confident. And this all assumes a more-of-the-same economic environment. The economic environment gets better, that's terrific.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So really, the $100 million, that is really driven by the macro, not any specific issue you have in terms of execution or any of the projects. It sounds like maybe out of all of them, Asia and China relative to Sun JV is where you might potentially have the most swing factor. Will those be the 2 growth areas?","John V. Faraci","Probably, yes, that's a fair statement, George. Let's see -- trying to forecast what's happening in China is never easy. We could easily have a $50 million swing.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Appreciate the color on that and for that matter, all the details on the slide deck and the conference call. I wanted to take it back on earlier question I think Mark had asked and directed at Mark Sutton in terms of the supply chain and output potential within containerboard. Now given as you see the world and given your 3 channels, you believe that you have a need for all the 13 million tons that you produced. And certainly, the results you've been putting out would suggest that, that's correct. Do you see the footprint necessarily being unchanged in producing those 13 million tons over time, or could you have a leaner or lighter footprint as you get those tons out of your system over the next couple of years? And what are the next big moves within the mill and supply chain optimization program?","Mark Stephan Sutton","George, that's a great question on the footprint. I mean, we are optimizing the 17 mills that we have now, and it's always possible that we could find a way to make immediate containerboard with a lighter footprint. We don't have anything in the near term that would say we found that. The biggest work left to do in the supply chain is -- we sort of don't talk about this much, but we're operating these mills on 2 different, distinctly different, supply chain systems, but we've completely blended the supply to the box plants and to the open market between the 2 systems. And so there's a level of manual operation that will go away through 2013 as we install the new supply chain systems that we use in International Paper in all of the former Temple mills. And that is probably going to produce the opportunity for the biggest internal cost benefit and external service benefit for our customers. So that's what we're focused on for this year. In addition to, as Carol mentioned, the one area in the synergy target that's not quite filled, the bucket that's not quite filled, is the mills in the supply chain. There are some projects we're going to execute in the first half of the year, mainly in the first quarter, that will allow us to capture those mill synergies from a cost and operational flexibility and, in some cases, from a quality standpoint. So I think we've got a lot of opportunity, and we are always studying the footprint not only in this business but in all the businesses in the company and looking for the smartest way to produce the product we need for the demand we have.","John V. Faraci","We can make what we need to with less facilities to do it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. Two last quick ones, and I'll turn it over, one on xpedx and the other on maintenance spending for the year. On xpedx, and taking a step back, were you pleased with the performance in the business in the quarter and in the year in light of the discussion, I guess, from a year or so ago, where Mary gave a review on the next step change, where you used that as a phrase of the day, in terms of xpedx's potential in improving your profitability, how would you have us think about that? And then on maintenance spending, we appreciate the schedules. I thought I heard you say at one point in time there's a $7 million improvement or reduction in maintenance spending. One of the slides has $11 million. And then when I compared Slides 30 and 37 to look at the sequential change in maintenance, I don't see much of a difference, at least not in my deck. Can you just tic-and-tac that for us?","John V. Faraci","Well, George, Mary is not here, so I'll speak to the xpedx. I think if Mary was here, she'd say she wasn't satisfied with xpedx's performance in 2012 and principally because we weren't able to offset all these challenges we had on the print side with revenues. And that said, we like the progress we've made on the buy, handle, sell front. And if we hadn't done that, we wouldn't be where we're at. But we've got to quickly get our warehouse configuration in place. That will be in place by the end of the year. And get all of the purchasing that we're going to centralize to get the advantage of that. So more work to be done, but I'd say we're basically close to being on schedule in terms of the internal stuff. What we didn't see was the challenge we're going to see in the print space, principally commercial printing. So it's not paper overall, it's coated papers. That's our biggest product line. So, no, we're not satisfied or pleased where we're at, but this is where we are at, and we're holding our own.","Carol L. Roberts","And related to your question on maintenance, I see what you're saying. On 37 and 38, we're showing essentially flat, and yet I called out a change. And we'll clarify that for you, and -- but my guess is the back schedules are probably closer, and we probably have some other projects that I included in that, that were operational in nature.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So on recent calls, it seems there had been some diverging views around virgin wood fiber prices in the U.S. And your charts, obviously, do show a bit of an uptick in your wood basket. So I'm just kind of curious how you guys are thinking about these recent trends. How much would you say is seasonal versus, perhaps, the start of a structural trend given the recovery in housing and increased wood pellet demand?","John V. Faraci","Well, I guess I'd characterize that, Phil, saying we've come to see more upside -- more pressure on recycled fiber costs than we see on virgin fiber costs. But we see upside pressure on both but more on the recovered fiber side of it. And we're big -- obviously big in both, so you're right. What's going on with housing, OSB plants coming back online, lumber mills coming back online. We're going to get the chips, but we're not going to get chips from OSB plants when you've got some wood pellet plants that are starting up. And so that's all principally softwood. On the hardwood side, I'd say it's not as acute on the demand side, but we see some upside pressure, but hardwood prices didn't come down as much as plant prices did. So we don't see a blowout in fiber prices, but we see some upside pressure, probably more upside pressure on recycled fiber prices, just because of the impact that China has on recovered fiber markets around the world. They've got a 40 million-ton box market now, and most all of that's recycled fiber. And that's going to continue to grow, and it's going to grow all with recycled fiber.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And to clarify the $200 million input costs, does it assume stable wood fiber prices after the first quarter, basically, or declines, or how you're thinking about that?","John V. Faraci","We're assuming some virgin fiber prices rise through 2013. We're assuming that the OCC prices rise through 2013, and we got a little bit of year-over-year energy costs, because we don't see -- we see low energy gas prices, we don't see $2 gas on the horizon. We have that for a while in 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from the light of Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm just curious, when you look at the comments on kind of appreciated demand in late December, we saw that across all the printing and rating grades. Just wondering, did you see that type of phenomenon in any other product area where kind of at the end of the year, things dropped off, and just to clarify exactly kind of has that bounced back, to what extent, in January?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Gail, this is Tom Kadien. We saw, I think, a similar pattern, as Tim described, on uncoated freesheet and the coated board segment. But I would say that I'm feeling a bit better as January has gotten longer, things have seem to come out of the seasonal fourth quarter, which was pretty weak in the back part of the quarter.","Timothy S. Nicholls","And, Gail, it's Tim. I would just build on, as we mentioned earlier, that we saw a similar thing in the uncoated freesheet business as we moved into January. It seemed like people were building or rebuilding pipelines, inventory pipelines, as we got into the first couple weeks of this month. So in our mind, it just reinforced the fact that things kind of shut down at the end of the year.","John V. Faraci","Yes, keeping in mind IP is a global company. We had in Europe, in South America, in India, in Russia, we finished the year probably as strong on the demand side as we started the year. We're gaining share in Europe. We're gaining share in South America. We're probably growing with the market in India. And we need more capacity in Russia. So the trends that we were talking about are really North American trends, but they're not the same as the global trends.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just some questions on the containerboard export market, if you could just give us more color on what you're seeing there and in particular, what's happened to pricing in the last little bit and maybe, if possible, where mill mets are on export tonnage versus domestic?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Mark, the export market, really, that was one of the positives in the fourth quarter. It remains strong where we normally see a bit of a dip. We saw strong demand, especially in Europe, the Middle East and Asia and also in Latin America. Craft liner demand in Asia wasn't quite as strong, but it was stable with the prior quarter, so we just didn't see any uptick. And prices continue to improve. I think our prices were up over the third quarter, close to $40 a ton, and $57 to $60 from the beginning of the year. So in essence, demand has been steady to improving in all the markets we serve, and pricing has been improving.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And have those trends effectively continued in the first part of this year?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Yes, they have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just had a quick question on the box plant system. You mentioned that you're at 100% for the synergy savings. That got you to the $150 million on the box plant savings for the synergies. But you also mentioned at the Analyst Day of $50 million of optimization savings above and beyond that $150 million. Can you talk about sort of when you think you can attain that, what else is left to do to optimize the box system going forward? Maybe how soon you can get to the $50 million run rate?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Scott, the $50 million was part of the overall optimization. That's the part we sort of peg for the box business, and we feel -- we still feel very good about being able to achieve that. And I think a good portion of that we'll achieve through the 2013 time period. And it's a lot -- it's not a silver bullet, it's a lot of initiatives on the commercial side. And some of it relates back to what we talked about on the supply chain. As soon as we can have one system and really optimize our supply chain, we'll make sure that freight is at an absolute lowest and box plant waste is at an absolute lowest, and then we'll have opportunity to improve our commercial performance. And we still feel very good about the optimization targets that we shared back at Investor Day.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe there are some potential upside to the $350 million to $400 million project in 2013 from the box optimization? I didn't see it listed in the projects anywhere.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Part of the reason it's not listed as a project, is we view it -- as we move through the synergy acquisition period, as John said, we view it as optimizing the business, so we don't call it out. But at the end, it's inside of the words we used around the upside of industrial packaging for 2013 and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Atkinson with BMO Capital.","Stephen Atkinson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","In terms of Orsa, are you able to take about any, should we say, low-hanging fruit or synergies with regards to your existing businesses there?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Stephen, it's Tim. I think we're -- it's 2 weeks, so, as I think John said, it is early days, but what we see so far, we like. It's kind of right in line with expectations. If you recall, this was all about taking what was generally a good commercial operation and looking at the manufacturing side and increasing efficiencies and lowering costs. Our first view being in the facilities for a couple weeks says that everything that we thought was there is there, and there may be other opportunities.","John V. Faraci","It's a 20% EBITDA margin business, and we think we can get it to the 25% range.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Following on that question, do you think that Orsa's lack of Timberland is a competitive disadvantage versus the other virgin producers? And do you expect to acquire Timberland to support Orsa?","John V. Faraci","No, that's not the plan, currently, Mark. In the holding company that Orsa was pulled out of, there are forestry assets. We chose not to have them included in the business because, quite frankly, we didn't feel like we needed them to support the business. So there's supply arrangements with their forestry operations for a portion of the furnished, but a lot of it will be coming from open market.","John V. Faraci","Mark, the dynamics of the pine supply-side in Brazil are very different than the hardwood side. A lot of pine was planted a long time ago, and so you don't have to have plantations like you do in the paper business to be able to access fiber.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Sure. We've seen those prices move up. That was why I was wondering.","John V. Faraci","Yes. The prices will move up, but you know the land business, if prices then should move up on your own land because you need market to market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, I think you said that you expect free cash flow in '13 of $2 billion?","John V. Faraci","I think we should be approaching $2 billion.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Approaching $2 billion, so that would imply that free cash flow is up about $450 million on a year-over-year basis?","John V. Faraci","In that ballpark, yes.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you guys talked about the incremental runway from the internal projects of $350 million to $450 million, so a midpoint of about $400 million, so that imply that price cost minus the impact from divested mills is about $50 million in 2013?","John V. Faraci","Well, part of the free cash flow generation is coming from that $400 million of strategic initiatives improvement, then you've got the box price increase in containerboard, and then you've got a bunch of cost headwinds. And so all that nets out to just what we -- $450 million roughly of free cash flow. But remember, only -- that's only 40% of the impact of those projects. There is another kind of double it to come in 2014, '15.","John V. Faraci","Yes, let me just, before I need to wrap up here, just summarize kind of how we see things. So 2012 is now behind us. We thought it was very much of a transition year for International Paper. And setting an all-time free cash flow or all-time cash from operations record in the transition year, we're pleased with, but we're not satisfied that you've seen all that International Paper can do. So we're excited about 2013. I hope it remains a cash flow story. And even in a more-of-the-same economic environment, we're pretty positive on the kind of incremental earnings and cash flow we're going to generate in what still is in the mid-cycle environment around the world. So we'll be looking forward to talking to you in the quarters coming about our progress.","Glenn Landau","Thanks, John, and thank you, all, for joining today.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Thank you, Laurie. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide two including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter 2018 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, slide two also provides context around the financial information presented on those slides.","I will now turn now the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark Sutton","Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on slide three. International Paper delivered very strong earnings in 2018, with strong performance across our three businesses, achieving a second consecutive year of 16% EBITDA growth. Our Ilim joint venture also delivered excellent results with operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion. All in, we continue to grow value for our shareholders with the return on invested capital of 13% which is significantly above our cost of capital.","During the year, we invested strategically to further strengthen our Industrial Packaging business. Among these investments, we opened a new box plant in Toluca, Mexico, that will be fully integrated with containerboard provided from our U.S. mill system. We also made targeted investments in our U.S. Box business to enhance our capabilities with a deliberate focus on serving the fastest-growing segments and being aligned with the best customers. These investments all have returned to more than 25%.","We also took decisive measures to further derisk the company and strengthen our balance sheet. We paid down $500 million in debt, bringing our leverage ratio down to 2.8 times and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which reduced our diluted shares outstanding by 3%.","Turning to the full year results on slide four. Our revenue increased by more than 7% and we expanded our margins by 150 basis points on strong commercial performance across our businesses. Our equity earnings were $336 million, including $290 million from our Ilim joint venture. All in, we delivered another strong solid year of free cash flow.","Turning to slide five. International Paper delivered a very strong year of return on invested capital. We increased our five-year average to 11%. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio. We are making the right investment choices and delivering on those commitments.","I'll now turn it over to Tim who will cover the performance across our businesses and our first quarter outlook. Tim?","Tim Nicholls","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 6 which shows our year-over-year operating earnings bridge. Operating earnings improved by $1.83 driven primarily by price and mix improvement across our three businesses. Operations and costs were negatively impacted by weather events during the year and startup costs associated with the Madrid mill. Ops and costs were also impacted by LIFO inventory revaluation charges related to price activity in 2018.","Input costs were a headwind in 2018 driven by higher wood, chemicals and distribution which were partially offset by lower OCC. Corporate expenses, interest and taxes were lower and equity earnings improved on strong performance in Ilim and the benefit of Graphic Packaging. As Mark said, International Paper delivered very strong results in 2018.","Turning to slide 7, our fourth quarter results. EBITDA improved by 8% year-over-year as we expanded margins in our three businesses. Our equity earnings were $79 million including $67 million from our Ilim joint venture and $10 million from Graphic Packaging. Free cash flow in the quarter was solid and we completed $200 million in share repurchases. All in the company finished on a strong note.","Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on slide 8. Operating earnings improved by $0.09. Price and mix improved in all businesses and regions. Operations in cost improved due to lower Madrid mill startup costs and favorable one-time items of about $20 million.","The fourth quarter was the lowest maintenance outage quarter of the year representing less than 10% of our total maintenance outage expense in 2018. Input costs were a headwind particularly for energy and wood. We expect hardwood cost to remain elevated due to poor operating conditions from heavy rains.","Now let me turn to the segments. Starting with Industrial Packaging on slide 9. The North American business performed very well delivering $641 million in earnings and a 25% EBITDA margin. Box demand was strong driven by e-commerce and produce and we continue to see strong box demand as we enter 2019 with shipments in January we're estimating between 1.5% and 2%.","Export containerboard came under pressure in the fourth quarter with demand slowing in China and some other -- in some regions in EMEA. We're also seeing the impact of higher tariffs in Turkey which is a major importer of U.S. containerboard. We expect volume and price pressure to continue in the first quarter as inventory destocking plays out.","Continuing with the fourth quarter performance. Operations and cost benefited from onetime items, which were largely offset by higher distribution cost. Input costs were a significant headwind in the quarter due to higher natural gas and wood cost. Fourth quarter was another good example of the strength of our Industrial Packaging team and their ability to execute well.","On slide 10. The Global Cellulose Fibers business delivered earnings of $93 million in the fourth quarter. Earnings were largely in line with our expectations with the exception of input costs, which were impacted by higher wood and energy again. We delivered a strong fourth quarter against a changing macro backdrop.","Towards the end of the quarter, we saw a softening in softwood and fluff demand in China along with slowing demand in Turkey largely due to foreign currency headwinds. These trends have continued into the seasonally slower first quarter as customer destocking plays out and we move into the Chinese New Year.","Printing Papers on slide 11. The business delivered excellent results, driven by strong commercial and operating performance. Price realization and volume were favorable across all geographies. Again input costs were a headwind due to the higher wood and energy costs. Overall a very strong quarter and year.","In North America, our uncoated free sheet volume outpaced industry shipments for the year. Our Europe and Russia Papers businesses delivered solid earnings of about $130 million, overcoming high wood costs and other operational challenges. And in Brazil, earnings for the year improved by 17% and our EBITDA margins continue to be very healthy in the low 30% range. All in, we have good momentum as we move into 2019.","Now, I'll turn to Ilim. Ilim's results on slide 12. The joint venture delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter with operating EBITDA of $310 million. Volume was higher with no planned maintenance outages in the fourth quarter.","International Paper's equity earnings were $67 million and were impacted by a noncash foreign exchange charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt, of which IP's portion was $19 million or $0.05 per share in the quarter.","For the full year, Ilim operating EBITDA was $1.2 billion, which represents a 45% margin. IP's equity earnings were $290 million. Overall, the business performed very well and provided $128 million in cash dividends to IP in 2018.","Turning to slide 13 and our first quarter outlook. I'll take you through all of the puts and takes by business. So, starting with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to be down $15 million, driven by containerboard exports. Volume is expected to be down $40 million on seasonally lower volume in North America and lower export containerboard volume as customer destocking continues into the first quarter.","Operations and costs are expected to increase by $100 million largely due to unabsorbed fixed costs related to lower volume, higher seasonal energy consumption as well as inflation and the non-repeat positives from the fourth quarter. Staying with Industrial Packaging. Planned maintenance outages are expected to increase by $102 million and input costs are expected to be flat.","In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to be down $5 million and volume to be down $10 million. Operations and costs are expected to increase by $50 million due to unabsorbed fixed costs related to lower volume, higher seasonal energy consumption as well as inflation and the non-repeats from the fourth quarter. Planned maintenance outages are expected to increase by $20 million. So all-in this will be a significant reduction for the business in the quarter.","So, let me add some color on Cellulose Fibers. Earlier I shared the macro environment in certain regions of the world. Complicating that for us a poor commercial decision was made that is going to negatively impact our fluff pulp volume in the quarter. While I believe this is only a temporary setback, it is going to take us until sometime between the second and the third quarter of this year to fully resolve. However, it does not change our belief in the fundamentals of the business and our ability to create value over time.","Moving to Printing Papers. Price and mix are expected to be down $10 million due to seasonal mix in Brazil. Volume is expected to be down $10 million from lower seasonality in Brazil. Operations and costs are expected to increase by $35 million driven by higher seasonal energy inflation and timing of spending.","Staying with Printing Papers, planned maintenance outages are expected to increase by $3 million and input costs are expected to increase by $5 million on continued pressure on hardwood in North America.","Under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging. In other items, we include corporate and interest expense as well as our estimated effective tax rate of 24% to 26%. We expect our full year corporate expense to be $70 million and interest expense to be $500 million.","I'll move to the full year outlook on slide 14. We are projecting full year EBITDA for the company of between $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion. Our North American Industrial Packaging business is performing well and domestic box demand is strong.","In Europe, the benefits of the Madrid mill will accelerate through the year. Volume recovery in our fluff pulp business is against the backdrop of 4% growth in the market and our Papers business is performing very well. Putting all of these together, we expect strong free cash flow of $2 billion among other positive factors that will impact our cash flow; CapEx is planned at $1.4 billion; and we expect to receive $200 million in dividends from Ilim.","As we did in 2018, we will use our free cash flow for debt reduction and cash to shareholders. We are committed to a strong and sustainable dividend and we have a $2.2 billion share repurchase authorization.","On slide 15, we made progress strengthening our balance sheet as Mark referenced in 2018. We reduced balance sheet debt by $500 million, our pension plan is sufficiently funded and we took definitive actions to further derisk the plan.","In 2018, we also reduced our cash balance by $400 million. Effectively we put this cash to better use by applying it toward debt reduction and share repurchases. Going forward, we expect our cash balance will remain in the $600 million range.","So, with that, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Sutton","Thank you, Tim. I just want to take this opportunity to share my views on International Paper and the year we have ahead of us in 2019. Coming off of strong record earnings in 2018 with really solid performance across the portfolio, and more importantly, we strengthened our businesses and we strengthened the company as we head into 2019.","Our businesses are stronger. We're well positioned to drive through any challenge we may face. We have the people, the innovation, the best value chain to solve our customer's needs and a low-cost high-quality manufacturing system to succeed. We're investing in high-return projects to improve our businesses all of which drives our strong cash generation.","We've also improved overall International Paper. We're a stronger company. We're well positioned to grow free cash flow in 2019 meaningfully, and we're strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. To me it's all about value creation. That's what drives our decisions. And we're looking forward to 2019.","And with that, we are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Just looking at Industrial Packaging, it seems like your January shipments are stronger than what you saw on 4Q. And that seems consistent with what some of your competitors are saying. Is it possible to say what kind of drove the weakness in 4Q in terms of end markets or categories or regions?","Tim Nicholls","Well, I think that \u2013 hi, Anthony, it's Tim.","Anthony Pettinari","Hi.","Tim Nicholls","I think there were some strong comps that we were up against. We did finish the year very strong. December was a very good month for us at 2.5% and we see that continuing as we go into January. So part of its timing and part of it is the way the months lay out. But on balance, the fourth quarter for us was a pretty strong quarter.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. And then just in your 1Q outlook and kind of prepared remarks you referenced export destocking. Any visibility in terms of how long that could take to run its course or where customer inventories are maybe relative to history? And then just kind of related question, how do you feel about your own internal containerboard inventory levels? I think some of your competitors have talked about opportunities to take inventories down but they have some projects and M&A situations that you don't. Just any kind of general thoughts you have on your own inventory levels.","Tim Nicholls","Yeah. I don't think the destocking is a long-term impact. Depending on the region of the world some things make it a little bit harder to see clearly like Chinese New Year. We always \u2013 every year we have this for pulp and to some extent containerboard, where buying stops ahead of Chinese New Year and then you have to see how it picks up, once everyone is back.","We do know that in Europe there's customers inventories, especially given the tightness that existed through a lot of last year. There's probably safety stocks that we think are in place and it'll take a month or two for those to kind of flow through. I don't see it as being longer than that, but we'll have to see how it plays out. As far as our inventories, I think we feel good. We're adequately supplied. We've got tremendous flexibility.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim.","Mark Sutton","Good morning.","Tim Nicholls","Good morning.","Mark Wilde","I wonder Mark just to kind of start off, if you could talk a little bit about how you see the impact of that GP announcement down at Port Hudson affecting your business. I'm particularly interested in kind of the \u2013 well there's change of the timing around the Selma conversion and also whether you've announced a price increase in uncoated paper?","Mark Sutton","That's a great question, Mark. The \u2013 specifically to the impact of changing supply in the uncoated free sheet business and its impact on our Selma conversion, the original reason and the reason we communicated about making that conversion was to go into high-quality bleached linerboard. And that's something we need for the places we're growing the box business.","So it wasn't really a \u2013 the driver wasn't our white paper system. It was what we need for our packaging system and it's a great asset to do it. So we communicated a change into 2020 and right now we're sticking with that plan. We're going to need that product pretty quickly as we get into 2020 for the box growth that we are targeting and experiencing.","So I don't see any change in that plan. What it does in terms of the market obviously is it just -- a continuing evolving change in the supply base as that product line and market goes through its normal evolution. So for us our Printing Papers business is well positioned. We've got great products, a full range of products and great customers. And we -- that business is still playing an important position on the team.","Q \u2013 Mark Wilde","Okay. My follow-on question is really around capital allocation. And I'm just curious, it sounds like you guys pulled back pretty dramatically on capital projects in the fourth quarter. And I wondered if you could you just put a little color around the things that went into that decision.","And it's also in the fourth quarter, it seemed like your cadencing on share repurchase was pretty much in line with what we had seen through the first three quarters of the year. And I'm just kind of curious about why you might not have accelerated that given the weakness in equities in the fourth quarter?","A \u2013 Tim Nicholls","Yes I'll take the second part of the...","A \u2013 Mark Sutton","You take the second. I'll take the first yes.","A \u2013 Tim Nicholls","Yes. So we got our hand signals mixed up there for a minute. So yes I think Mark, what you saw on the fourth quarter was continuing to buy shares, but also making sure that we were applying cash to the balance sheet as well. And as I mentioned a minute ago or showed on the slide, we did get to the top end of our range in terms of leverage for the balance sheet.","And there's opportunity to take that lower, but we expect we're going to have a lot of cash to apply to share repurchases as we go through this year as well. So it was just a choice. We had bought shares in the second and in the third. We continue to buy in the fourth and we paid down some debt at the same time.","A \u2013 Mark Sutton","Mark on the capital projects, there was nothing that we did in the fourth quarter that's not somewhat normal as you look at finishing your year. Some projects move faster than you expected, some move slower and it was just a matter of managing the spending that we had committed to.","This happens from time to time. It's just a little bit more activity. So we ended up where we thought we would end up right in the zone that we communicated to investors for total capital spending. And so when you have as many projects and as large an asset base, you just got to sync these stuff up toward the end of the year. So it's just a matter of changing the cadence of some of the final execution of these projects.","Q \u2013 Mark Wilde","Okay, fair enough, thanks and good luck in '19.","A \u2013 Mark Sutton","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Q \u2013 George Staphos","Thank you, operator. Hi, good morning, thanks for all the detail guys. I wanted to spend the first question probing some of the hopefully one-off related issues in the quarter that have implications in for 2019. Can you comment a bit on what was in the $20 million of one-off good guys I guess for 4Q? And can you comment on what the commercial decision in Cellulose Fibers is related to and why it will take until the middle of the year to correct that? And I have a follow-on.","A \u2013 Tim Nicholls","Yes, hey, George, it's Tim. The $20 million it's a bunch of things honestly. It's all at corporate and a lot of small items that added up to a bigger-than-usual number in the quarter. I think that's the best way to describe it.","A \u2013 Mark Sutton","So George on the commercial decision, we make these type of decisions all the time running our businesses. And this particular decision had to do with trying to shift some of our customer mix for all the right reasons, to improve our margins, to actually improve customer service across our portfolio. We made some decisions and of course when you shift customer mix, you need to replace what you\u2019re shifting out of and shifting into. And what's happening is it's just taking us longer to do the second part of that.","So our execution isn't as good as it has been when we've made these kind of decisions, but it's not an abnormal type of decision. It's just our execution is not something that we've done as well as we normally do on. It will be fine. It will just take us a little longer. The market is growing. We're outperforming the market. We'll continue to do that based on our portfolio of products and customers. We just had a shift project that's taking longer than we originally intended.","Q \u2013 George Staphos","Mark, just to fill in some white space there. But ultimately you expect to replace whatever volume was lost I mean, that's my takeaway with fluff volume and fluff customers correct in terms of the shift?","Mark Sutton","Yes. Yes, fluff volume, fluff customers and we fully expect to continue to perform very well. And we should perform better than the market based on our footprint of capability, but also our product portfolio. So absolutely, it's absorbent for absorbent. It's just in different customers in different regions at higher economic value.","Q \u2013 George Staphos","Thank you. My second question and I'll do it quickly here. If we think about the free cash flow guidance for 2019 at $2 billion I recognize that's your guidance and so that's the number you want to stick to. But given that the markets are kind of in an interesting position in terms of the supply and demand there's some destocking pressure not for you but for others in some of your bigger markets, where do you think the tensions are on that free cash flow? Are we more apt to see holding price constant free cash flow be in excess of $2 billion? Or do you -- are you pulling every lever you can to get to that figure? Thank you and good luck in the quarter.","Tim Nicholls","Yes, well we always try to pull all the levers for free cash flow, so that doesn't change. But I do think to your point George, the $2 billion is what we put out there, but I can see upside to it as we go through the year.","Q \u2013 George Staphos","Thank you, Tim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of Stephens.","Mark Connelly","Thank you. Two things. What has been happening and will happen now after GP to your white paper mix? And I'm curious whether you're seeing any meaningful difference in U.S. versus other markets in terms of how the decline in demand is playing out in terms of your particular mix?","Mark Sutton","I think our mix Mark is staying pretty constant relative to the roll business for the printing industry the cut size business and some of the specialties we make. I think it's a little early to tell. Obviously, we are a major supplier. So we're seeing customers interested in us becoming their supplier post the GP announcement. But it's a little early to see what we're going to take and what it's going to do to our mix.","But actually with the system we have now with essentially four mills -- 3.5 mills our mix is kind of ridden down with the decline because not all parts of the mix are declining at the same rate. But our facilities are pretty flexible, so we've continued to be able to optimize the mix for the best margin and best profitability. We should see pretty quickly here in the first quarter, how any incremental business that comes our way starts to shift that.","Mark Connelly","Okay. So, you answered the flexibility question. Just one more. Can you give us a sense of how you're getting to your 1% to 2% growth estimate? Are you still thinking in terms of GDP plus? And what would drive a plus? I'm sorry I didn't...","Tim Nicholls","Yes. I may not be responding to exactly what you're asking Mark this is Tim, but I referenced the 1.5% to 2%. That's what we were seeing in January. And I think fundamentally with the way we see the economy performing we expect it to be in that range. So, that's how we're looking not only at January, but I think that probably holds up for the year.","Mark Sutton","So, Mark we've talked about this before. We acknowledged that sometime in the past, box demand and GDP kind of decoupled a bit. We actually have a model that we've developed with some outside resources and some internal data analytics that GDP is obviously a major function, but there are other indicators about how we think about box demand and it doesn't always track directly with GDP. There were periods where box demand slightly outperformed GDP, but we didn't conclude that it was now back on that track. So, it's a set of analytics we use. GDP is obviously a function and the input to GDP, but it's not just a GDP measure for us.","Mark Connelly","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover of Davidson.","Steven Chercover","Thanks. Two quick questions. First of all IP makes about one in three boxes in North America and I think it's more like one in two for the big e-commerce player. I'm wondering if that's still the case. And how this alleged making the boxes more appropriate size-wise can you actually get paid for doing so?","Tim Nicholls","We think we can. And yes I'd say your figures are directionally correct. I think the good news is we service a lot of customers in the e-commerce space and we work with all of them very closely, our design teams our commercial teams. And it's not just optimizing box size, its optimizing flow through fulfillment centers to make sure that they are getting the most efficiency in their fulfillment centers as well as getting it to the customers. So, it's not just -- is the box the absolute precisely the optimum box? It's what works in the broader system.","Mark Sutton","The interesting thing Steve is that every e-commerce major player has a slightly different value proposition to customers and this velocity through their supply chain is more important to some than others. And so for the ones that it's as not as important you might actually be able to get to the perfect box even if it slows you down because that's their value proposition.","But for others, there's a physics issue here that you've got to be able to load the product through the value chain. And so we're at the table with all the major people who sell direct and helping them to figure out not how to make a box smaller how to make their business model work better. And sometimes that changes the amount of packaging needed. Sometimes it actually improves our economics because of the way we're able to help them meet their goals.","Steven Chercover","Terrific. Yes, that's what I wanted to clarify that it's not necessarily a negative just because the volume is lower. And my other quick question was with respect to Consumer Packaging. I mean you're not directly reporting it but you still have a lot of skin in the game. So, are you optimistic about the prognosis for the industry and are you happy with how your partner is behaving?","Mark Sutton","I would say the investment we made with our business into Graphic is doing what we expected it to do. They're building out the business, integrating the SPS. We think that that is working out as intended. And I think the market is -- got a lot of potential because you see every day question marks about types of packaging, single-use packaging, sustainable versus non-sustainable, and I think it's going to be an interesting ride as we look at policy and we look at consumer preferences. But those products are pretty good pretty well-positioned for where the buyer and the public sentiment is going.","Steven Chercover","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Adam Josephson","Mark and Tim, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question.","Tim Nicholls","Good morning.","Adam Josephson","Tim, just one on the guidance. The one -- thanks for the bridge earlier. The EBITDA guidance seems like it's around $815 million, which seems to imply the year is going to be somewhat back-half weighted. I know maintenance costs are appreciably lower in the second half as they are every year.","And I know you called out seasonality a fair bit. Is there a way to help us just with what the seasonality impact is in 1Q perhaps relative to the other three quarters? Just so we can get a figure out how you're getting to that full year guidance based on what you talked about for 1Q?","Tim Nicholls","Yes, sure. I mean, directionally it's probably our lowest quarter from a demand standpoint seasonally. So it picks up in the second quarter. And it used to be that the fourth quarter was a weaker quarter as well, but we've seen that change over the past three or four years.","Your comment on maintenance outages is correct. In the first half of the year we'll have roughly 80% of our maintenance outages completed, and then it drops off significantly in the third, and again, significantly in the fourth quarter as well.","Adam Josephson","Okay. Thanks for that. And Mark on Europe, European containerboard prices are falling a fair bit. And obviously you're interested in getting into that market earlier last year. I mean, what are your thoughts about that market at this point with the overcapacity situation there the demand? And any implications of what's happening there for what may happen in the U.S. at some point down the road? Thank you.","Mark Sutton","It's a good question, Adam. I think the European market is different than the U.S. and the price of containerboard and the price of boxes behave a little bit differently. I think I've made this comment before. With the recycled part of that industry, which is 75%, 78% of it, it's really a series of regional markets. So, lower containerboard prices on average in Europe don't mean a whole lot. It means something in a region, but not across Europe.","And then there's always the spread between recycled linerboard and the virgin paper that's typically used because it's needed for some performance spec. And so that's how that market kind of frames up.","And as far back as I can personally remember there's always been somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% overcapacity, nameplate capacity of containerboard versus demand. But because of that regional nature you had very good parts of the market even if you got an average overcapacity. We tend to be targeted right now in the southern part of Europe with a certain end-use box mix and largely are going to be mostly integrated on our recycled grades with Madrid. And we're integrated on our Kraftliner from the U.S.","So we like our position we have right now. I think over time it'll depend on how the European industry evolves. But you've really got to think about, my premise is you have to think about it as multiple regional markets.","Adam Josephson","Thanks a lot, Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner of Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning.","Tim Nicholls","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","Good morning, Tim. Good morning, Mark. Just focusing on cash and the return of cash to shareholders. For a minute, I mean, if I look at the $1.65 billion of free cash flow in 2018 and you're pretty close to that 50% payout ratio on the dividend, but then on -- so one I guess just questioning whether you would increase the dividend further or maybe just some caution on doing that just as we get later into the current cycle.","And then the second part is really on the share repurchase versus debt reduction. I mean you're right at the sort of long-term target on the balance sheet as far as net debt. I mean how should we think about debt reduction versus share repurchase at this point in the cycle?","Tim Nicholls","Yes so, two good questions. The first on the dividend, we typically look at that once a year and we tend to do it in the fourth quarter. That's been our practice over the past seven or eight years and we'll continue to do that. The key is that, we want it to be sustainable. And so we'll evaluate how we're thinking about things when we come to it later this year.","In terms of debt reduction and share repurchases as you can imagine, it would be somewhat situational and based on what we think of as the outlook that we're heading into. So we are in the range, but we're at the top end of the range on the balance sheet. We believe the balance sheet strength is foundational to the company, so we'll look at that very seriously.","And if there is opportunities to buy our shares below what we believe intrinsic value to be, we're going to be very active on that as well. So what we're trying to do is saying, there's a lot of cash and it's going to be applied to debt reduction and share repurchase and we will be as thoughtful as we can be as to how we divide the two.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And how should we think about sort of the annual share creep as we go forward?","Tim Nicholls","The annual share creep, are you talking about from incentive compensations?","Scott Gaffner","From compensation correct.","Tim Nicholls","Yes. I mean, I'm not going to forecast what hasn't been fully approved yet because that comes later in the first quarter. But we said minimum share repurchases of dilution. We ended the year at 400 million shares and you saw what we did last year. And you see the guidance that we've given this year around how much cash we have for debt reduction and share repurchase. So it will be well -- I would imagine it will be well in excess of any dilution that we see from incentive comp.","Mark Sutton","Yes, Scott. I think one way to think about what we're trying to do and it's a little bit different for International Paper over the prior period, but we're trying to figure out how to optimize for our shareholder base, the long-term returns through good investments and the short-term capital returns that happen through a dividend and share repurchases.","And as we said last year, we have not been as systematic and as understandable in that area. We think we made a lot of progress in 2018 and we plan on continuing that in 2019. But the balance sheet being in that zone that Tim described 2.5 to 2.8 is really important to us. We think it's the right way to run a basic materials company and a company that is exposed to the kinds of economic cycles we are.","But we do want to do and we're committed to doing a better job that shareholders understand on short-term capital returns and the longer-term returns that in many cases are the source of some of the cash flow that we actually have to allocate. The investments we made yesterday are producing this cash flow today.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Just one last quick one on box shipments, can you just talk about the cadence throughout the fourth quarter how you saw that progressed? Appreciate it.","Tim Nicholls","Yes. It was fairly even October and November and then we finished strong in December. So on balance we had a strong quarter -- fourth quarter of 2018.","Scott Gaffner","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Seaport Global.","Mark Weintraub","One point that you've made in the past is fluff pulp tends to have much more stable pricing than commodity paper grade pulp and certainly that's what we've been seeing so far. Now that, we've got a lot of the contracts now in place recognizing some reference to the commercial activity you talked about before, but are most of the contracts in place now that you have a good visibility for the great majority of what your fluff pulp pricing will be this year, or does that actually move with other indexes et cetera?","Mark Sutton","A portion Mark of our mix is contracted for the year and we know what that visibility is. There's a portion of the mix that is not on long-term contracts and so we've got pretty good visibility. And it's a true statement that the absorbent pulp is much more resilient on a price \u2013 well from a price perspective.","Again, there's always the question mark of how it compares to people who can make both softwood market pulp and fluff what's happening in the other market that's been under pressure. So you would typically see any available slowing capacity that could make fluff that has a qualified quality product to move into fluff. And that happens from time-to-time based on the health of the softwood market.","I think we've seen a little bit of that play out as we went through the \u2013 especially the second half of the fourth quarter. But with the growth rate and the type of products that ultimately this pulp goes into we feel real good about the market itself and our position in the market. And we think pricing will continue to be much more resilient than a typical softwood pulp grade would be.","Mark Weintraub","Sure. That makes a lot of sense. And just \u2013 given that you've got more of a global footprint than many of the other folks in the industry. I was hoping that you might provide a view on what you're seeing outside of North America and where there are maybe places of weakness or relative strength?","Mark Sutton","I think we see what you see. I mean, you hear about Europe and some of the country-by-country distractions that are going on whether it's France, Germany or Brexit that all results in a slightly lower economic rate of growth in Europe. And we see that, that's what Tim was talking about on some of the containerboard comments on export both volume and price.","We also see there is no secret that Chinese economy is slowing. We don't have a direct impact in some cases because of the types of products we sell there, but we see a demand change. And again, it's hard to figure out right now because of the overlay with Chinese New Year. And then I think, there's some disturbances on currency. Turkey's a great example. A lot of times that ends up being temporary, but that is a little bit of turmoil right now.","Latin America is actually improving. I think our biggest exposure is what we make in Brazil and sell everywhere else in Latin America, mostly white paper. That's actually kind of looking up, because of the new government in Brazil and the stabilization other than what's happening of course in Venezuela which we have no exposure to. We feel pretty good about the stability of Latin America.","But I think it's really Europe and how they've manage through their political issues and what ends up happening. I'm hopeful that, we figure out a solution between the U.S. and China on trade and the things that might be weighing on that whole exchange of commerce and we'll benefit, our customers will benefit and that's how that we benefit. So we're doing our part to try to influence policy and work on that as one of many voices.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Thanks for the quick tour. Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research.","Q \u2013 Chip Dillon","Yes, good morning and thanks for all the details. I had a question on the maintenance change from year-to-year. It looks like it's going down maybe $20 million, $25 million. And I recall a year or so ago you talked about shifting from a 12-month to an 18-month rotation if I had that right and that would cause 2018 to be much higher or that -- 2019 would be I thought down closer to $60 million or even more. Maybe it was $100 million. But could you just talk to us what's going on with maintenance and maybe why it didn't fall as far as maybe if I heard you right a year ago as you thought it would?","A \u2013 Tim Nicholls","Yes, hey Chip, it's Tim. So I think what we said a year ago at this time was that on a normalized level, we saw maintenance outage spending in the $460 million to $470 million range and last year was an elevated year and we expected some decrease in 2019. But you do this planning to varying degrees in terms of how far out in time you go. And so as we're into the second half of the year and later in the year finalizing some of that planning there's a little bit more for 2019 than we thought there could have been in this time last year. But we constantly work that number too, so that's a target. And our goal is to try to bring it as low as possible. But that, I mean, that's really the simplest explanation for how it rolls up.","Q \u2013 Chip Dillon","Okay. So in other words there could be more room down in the future?","A \u2013 Tim Nicholls","Yes.","Q \u2013 Chip Dillon","Okay, okay. And then just back to the dividend. You guys have actually raised it at least once, but generally once a year for the last nine years. There are a lot of companies that tend to fall into different kind of screens when they start to get into double digits.","And I know that it's very important that it remains sustainable so you don't want to get ahead of your skis on that, but what is your thought in terms of having some increase every year versus holding back and making it more meaningful and not raising it every year? Have you ever thought about that?","A \u2013 Tim Nicholls","Yes. And I think we go back to what we said about 40% to 50% of free cash flow. So we want it to be sustainable. We have a target range of free cash. And we look at longer term not just the year we're in, but longer-term planning about how we feel about that cash flow -- that cash flow stream.","And we have a very good dividend today, but we also have as I mentioned earlier the option of returning more cash through share repurchases as well. So I'm not making a call one way or the other. I'm just saying that's the framework that we look at and that's the same framework we'll go through later this year when we evaluate it.","Q \u2013 Chip Dillon","Okay. And then last one quickly on the whole -- on the Fluff Pulp business. How much would you say the issue with the customer shift is likely to take away this year? Maybe it's an EBITDA number that you can give us.","And I assume it's all in the first half. And if you make the replacement as you expect could -- and let's say prices stay where they are, would there be any reason you wouldn't see the results whether it's EBITDA or EBIT in the fourth quarter be comparable or better than what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018?","A \u2013 Tim Nicholls","Well, there's a lot of moving parts as you referenced some of them. But yes we think it's going to take us a couple of quarters for this to be fully resolved. I would hesitate to get into forecasting specific items across the company, but you see the impact in the first quarter from volume and the extra costs related to unabsorbed fixed. And as we referenced, we see it correcting itself in the second to third quarter and then we also provided how EBITDA is shaking out, we think, for the year. So I...","Mark Sutton","Yes. I think that's the way to think about it. I mean the guidance we gave on full company full year EBITDA factors in the specific issue along with some others, but the specific issue we mentioned in Cellulose Fibers. And I would -- the way I think about it, we were on a very good trend.","We're still on a good trend, except for this one issue that we'll recover from. So I think about it as sort of quarter-and-a-half, two-quarter pause in our integration of that business, outperforming the market, heading toward really being almost a year ahead of the investment plan. And we'll be in the second half of the year fully back on the track.","And we factored that into the full year outlook. Had none of this happened, in a perfect world with hindsight, we would see that incremental improvement. So we left that incremental improvement on the table. We're going to do our best. It's only January 31, so we're going to do our best to close that gap. But that's our best thinking right now in terms of how that flows into the full year company outlook.","Chip Dillon","Great. Thanks for the details.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Mark Sutton","Hi, Brian.","Brian Maguire","Mark, appreciate the color and the perspective you gave on the slide around value creation. One thing you didn't really mention on there was acquisitions. I'm just wondering, how you're really thinking about that these days, whether it be mill assets globally, or converting assets in different regions.","Has that changed meaningfully in the last couple of months? And presumably, multiples have come down a little bit, or some of the public equity multiples have changed. Would that impact your thinking on uses of cash from here, so just general thoughts on M&A at this point?","Mark Sutton","On the small types of acquisitions, where you could be talking about a box plant or something like that, there's always an opportunity to compare the economics of acquiring a plant in a location with a certain book of business, versus if you're already in that region, like the U.S. For us, we are everywhere, so we could organically invest the same amount of money or less in four plants and get exactly what we need, exactly where we need it.","That typically ends up winning out for International Paper. It may not be the right decision for other companies, because they may have a total lack of capacity in an area, but for us, most of our investments that look and smell like acquisitions on the small end had been organic investments.","But we'll always compare the options when we're looking to improve a part of the business, what's the best economic way to do it. And it's not simply just the financials. Do you like the location? Do you like the customers? Is it actually part of your strategy or is it just for sale? We don't like to buy things that are just for sale, if they're not part of the original strategic intent we have.","And so I wouldn't say we'd never look at it, because it would be probably foolish to say that, because you could miss a good opportunity that's better than an organic investment. But that's how we think about it. The reason you haven't seen us do much of it, is we've had better options organically with our internal asset base.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Appreciate the color. And then, just one last one on the -- back to the Cellulose Fibers issue. Just thinking about it operationally how this would work, will you be continuing to run that volume that you would have otherwise sold, and keep it in inventory until such time when you think you can find a home for it? Or operationally do you think you're just going to run those assets at a lower rate for the time being?","And then, assuming you do find some new customers for it, do you think there'll be qualification period needed there? Or operationally do you think you're just going to run those assets at a lower rate for the time being? And then assuming you do find some new customers for it, do you think there'll be qualification period needed there? Or are we talking about stuff that's pretty ubiquitous and pretty easily qualified in with the kind of customers you usually deal with?","Tim Nicholls","Yes, you're right. It does vary from customer to customer so there'll be probably some of all of that. To your question on running, I think we've been very straightforward about running our businesses to our customers' demand and making sure that we are optimizing our supply chain. And hence you saw the reference in the commentary of the unabsorbed fixed charge that we'll have in the quarter because we won't be running and covering that fixed cost.","Mark Sutton","I think the other reality on the replacement is in most cases it is with existing customers. It's just a matter of capturing that growth. Some of those customers are in the macro backdrop that Tim described around the last part of the fourth quarter with some slowing demand heading into Chinese New Year; some like in containerboard with a very tight fluff pulp market; some buying patterns that occurred when you could get it; and then some destocking.","If you think about interruptions we -- just our company had, and we're a large player, we had some operating issues earlier in the year we shared with you and then we had a hurricane and other things that I think for customers they say, man I better get what I can get now if it's qualified. So, that's part of what's happening. It's just the ability for that to regain traction.","The good news is it's the kind of product in most cases that we're already qualified on with many existing accounts that are growing at rates higher than the average. So, that's why I'm really confident we'll be able taking -- it's going to take a little longer than our original plan hence why we termed the decision a poor decision. We didn't just -- we just didn't have the execution of the recovery properly done.","Brian Maguire","Okay, appreciate the color guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde of Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabe Hajde","Good morning gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. The first one centers around, I guess, mill outage or production. 2018 kind of struck me as a pretty heavy year. You guys had roughly 520,000 tons of lost production from maintenance. Is there any way to help us understand what 2019 could look like given what you know now and what you plan to do in the mills? Or I guess maybe in another way is there incremental production that you would have access to that you otherwise didn't in 2018 due to the maintenance?","Tim Nicholls","Well, there's always a lot of puts and takes around capital projects that are completed during the current year and you get the benefit of it next year. Maybe the way to think about it is just from a dollar standpoint. In 2018, we spent $548 million on outages and we're guiding to $525 million this year.","But as I referenced in an earlier comment we're always looking to do that more efficiently and evaluate whether certain things absolutely have to be done or not. So, we're going to -- we have the target of $525 million, but we're obviously going to try to be lower than that in terms of our spending.","Gabe Hajde","Okay. And then can you remind us any debottlenecking efforts that you completed in 2017 or 2018 that would flow through into 2019 in terms of again incremental capacity? And I don't -- I apologize if you said Mark, if you confirmed that you did or did not go out with a price increase in the white paper?","Mark Sutton","Gabe, I didn't answer that question. So as we always say pricing, especially forward-looking pricing is really between International Paper and our customers. So you didn't miss anything.","Tim Nicholls","The only big material debottlenecking was our Maysville containerboard mill, which is a non-integrated mill. It produces recycled --sorry, lost my train of thought for a minute, our recycled containerboard.","So we had a major project that, I think it started back in late July and it took us about 30-plus days to complete the project itself and it's running well. But other than that it's just the normal small stuff, the benefits that you get from maintenance outages and things like that.","Gabe Hajde","Thank you, gentlemen, and good luck in the year.","Tim Nicholls","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn of RBC Capital.","Paul Quinn","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Just following up on this line of question around cellulose pulp. Just -- I'm trying to get idea to what you think the China slowdown right now. How much of that is a factor the U.S. - China trade issue?","And then if you could outline sort of in broad strokes what your percentage exposure to the Chinese market is on pulp for SBSK and I guess NBSK at Ilim?","Mark Sutton","I think the cost of the slowdown, how much of it is related to the U.S. - China trade discussion is hard to predict. I hear all kinds of assessments of it. But clearly if China was in the high-single digits in terms of growth and now they're in the mid to low I think a reasonable expectation is that -- a catalyst for that is the kind of uncertainty that's been put in place with these trade negotiations.","That's why I think underlying demand is not really changing all that much. But when you're not sure about the trade environment you -- and the Chinese are very good at inventory management, you just use your inventory for a while.","So we are speaking with all of our customers, trying to understand are consumers buying less of the product, it's the type of product that typically that doesn't happen unless you just can't afford it? Or is it you have enough inventory and we don't need the input material, which is the fluff pulp in its greater quantities? So, for your second part of the question. For our absorbent product pulp, so the fluff pulp category about 33% of our product goes into China.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now return the call to Guillermo Gutierrez for any additional or closing remarks.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Thank you, again, for joining International Paper's fourth quarter earnings call.

My name is Christy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] ","I would now like to turn the call over to Glenn Landau, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Glenn Landau","Thanks, Christy, and good morning. And thank you all for joining International Paper's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are John Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","During the call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of the presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. As always, our website will also contain copies of our fourth quarter 2011 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. I will now turn the call over to John Faraci.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everybody or good afternoon depending where you're calling in from. Over the next 20 to 30 minutes, Carol Roberts and I will review our full year and fourth quarter 2011 results and the performance of our individual businesses. We've also got Mary Laschinger, Senior Vice President and President of xpedx, here to give you all an update on the progress we're making in transforming our distribution business. ","And I'm going to start just by talking about the full year and set that up for Carol to go into the quarter. We had stronger full year results for International Paper. Actually, it was the best financial results in almost 2 decades. Margin expansion where we needed it; price realization stayed with us throughout the year; great operations and cost management, outstanding results from Ilim, which we'll talk about; and excellent cash generation. ","Looking at International Paper in North America and around the world. This is now on Slide 2, volumes in North America were down slightly, but sales revenue was up slightly, reflecting the fact we've got price flow through and strong margin expansion in our North American businesses of 200 basis points. ","Outside the U.S., we improved earnings, but it was in a different way. Margins, which were high, stayed high, but we've got good, strong volume growth up 6%, and as a result of that a plus in sales price improvement. Sales were up 17% outside North America, including the Ilim Joint Venture. ","So we're going to the next slide, looking at all for 2011. Sales moved up from $25 billion to $26 billion, strong improvement in EBIT from $1.8  to $2.3. EPS up by close to 50%. Cash from operations, again, very strong, solid free cash flow even though capital spending was up year-over-year. Year-end debt up some because of the pre-funding or pre-borrowing for the Temple acquisition, and very strong cash balance, even when you take out the debt that we put on the balance sheet for Temple, and we funded the pension plan as well. ","Yes, this next slide, I think, just shows the journey that International Paper has been on. The transformation plan is over. It was all aimed at putting International Paper in a position. From a portfolio standpoint, we've earned good [ph] returns and the cost to capital zone. And with the exception of 2009, which is now in the rearview mirror, the worst recession we had in 80 years, we've steadily been on that margin in 2011, which is still a challenging economic environment, we got to that 80% return. So we feel very good about the year, feel we had a strong quarter to end a very strong year. ","I'll come back at the end and talk about how we're looking in 2012. So Carol?","Carol L. Roberts","Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Let's take a look at the financial bridge from 2010 to 2011, where IP earned an incremental $1.20 per share from continuing operations and before special items. ","While volume in our consolidated businesses was down slightly, I think it's worth noting that our Ilim JV provided $0.21 of additional contribution, mainly driven by year-over-year revenue growth of 26%. ","I think the other main story that John mentioned in 2011 was the significant margin expansion driven by year-over-year price realization and mixed improvements, as well as excellent operations and cost management, and both of these more than offset the higher input cost of $0.61 a share. In summary, as John stated earlier, this result marks the best year that IP's had financially in almost 2 decades. ","So moving to the next slide to the fourth quarter. Earnings per share were $0.66. These results were in line with our expectations for the quarter as we experienced what we would see as the normal seasonal weakness in North America, and we did see some downward price pressure in market hold and exports from North America in both paper and packaging. Additionally, we had significant negative currency impact at our Ilim JV in this period, which did reduce their earnings in the quarter. These headwinds were somewhat offset by our global balance. We saw seasonally stronger demand in paper sales in Brazil, Russia and Eastern Europe, as well as stronger box volumes and improved margins in Europe. And we did see some input costs relief in fiber and energy. I think it's worth noting that as we exited the quarter, our inventory did remain in balance as we continued to balance our supply with our customers' demands. ","So taking a quick look at the fourth quarter financial snapshot that you can see on Slide 10. During the quarter, we did generate greater EBITDA year-over-year, and we did improve our margins by 100 basis points despite the headwinds that we just talked about. Importantly, the resulting free cash flow remained strong at $328 million. ","Going to the fourth quarter to third quarter slide, looking at the bridge from the third quarter, the seasonal headwinds on costs and volumes, you can see them there, and you can also see the impact of the lower prices for pulp and exports. And it did offset the positive on input costs. And also on this bridge, you can see the Ilim earnings impact, which was down $0.12 a share due to the currency impact that I've already mentioned. ","Let's just take a moment on the next slide and take a look at global input costs. As you can see on Slide 12, input costs in the quarter did provide some relief primarily at fiber, and that was primarily OCC; a little bit of energy. And so this was down and combined for a $42 million improvement in earnings from the third quarter. ","If I take you to Slide 13, I'd like to comment on our North American business operating rates. In North America, our mills ran at 91% operating rate in the quarter and 94% for the full year. ","And as you can see on this slide, our Packaging businesses did take nearly 240,000 tons of downtime in the quarter, and we did this quite simply to balance our supply with our customers' demand. As a result of these actions, our inventories are in good shape entering the new year. I will note that in containerboard, we do have a lot of outages coming up in the first and second quarter and then seasonally strong ivy [ph] season So we will plan to build some inventory early in the quarter to get through the second quarter. ","Moving to Slide 14, let's touch on Industrial Packaging. Industrial Packaging operating earnings in the fourth quarter of '11 were $316 million, compared to $301 million for the third quarter of '11. The current quarter's earnings were favorably impacted by very strong mill operations. We did talk about the lower recycled fiber costs in the U.S, and we do have a seasonally strong box volume in  Europe and improved margins in Europe. Partially offsetting these positive variances were higher maintenance outages. We did see lower export prices in containerboard, and we do have just a seasonally slower U.S. box business in the fourth quarter. ","If I take you to the chart on margins. This puts our Industrial Packaging results in perspective. Slide 15 shows our North American EBITDA returns for both '10 and '11 relative to the competition, and it's worth noting that in 2011, our EBITDA margins were above 20%, and importantly, 250 basis points better than last year and 350 basis points better than our next competitor. ","Just a quick comment regarding the Temple-Inland acquisition. As we announced last Friday, we have agreed to an extension until February 13th to provide time for the parties to complete the binding documentation to resolve the DOJ concerns with respect to the transaction. We anticipate entering into the definitive agreement on terms acceptable to all parties within this timeframe. We continue to work internally on our integration plans, and importantly over the last several weeks, our teams did get a chance to visit all the mills and, if I remember, quite energized with what we saw in terms of assets and potential synergies. And we remain very confident in our synergy target of $300 million. ","Moving to Consumer Packaging on Slide 17. Operating profits were $62 million in the fourth quarter of '11 compared with $103 million in the third quarter of '11. Increased maintenance outages, seasonally weaker U.S. in export demand for coated paperboard and lower pricing in China and Europe nearly partially offset by the lower input costs in the quarter. Relative to our competition, if you look at the total year in North America, the business continues to outperform in this space, improving EBITDA margins by 440 basis points greater than our next large competitor in 2011 versus '10. ","And logically, not surprisingly, this would amount to a record year for our North American Coated Paperboard business. And on Slide 19, we show that we nearly doubled our earnings over 2010 and achieved an almost 11% return on investment. ","Moving to Page 20, there's so many good things going on in our Coated Paperboard, business but an area that's worth mentioning is a portion of the success can be contributed to our supply chain initiative, which really are enabled by our associated enterprise-wide operating model. ","Things like schedule integrity improvements, make-to-stock functionality have enabled the business to reduce inventories by greater than 5% while increasing terms to close to 9 times. So this is a good outcome in a complex business which shows the results we can get. ","Another great success in 2010 was our Foodservice business. As we discussed last quarter, this business closed an outstanding year, finishing above pre-recession volume level and increasing earnings by nearly 20%. ","The key for this business has really been about aligning our sales with growing and winning customers as we introduce innovative new products. In 2012, our new Hold&Go insulated hot cup product line is going to roll out with a number of market leaders in the quick service and convenience store segments, driving further profitable growth and mix improvement. ","Moving onto Asia. Just a quick update on our capital expansion in our Sun JV. Construction is underway on our new coated paperboard machine, PM26. This project remains on schedule for our fourth quarter 2012 startup. And importantly it brings on an incremental 550,000 tons of new annual capacity of very high-quality coated paperboard. ","Moving to Printing Papers on Slide 23, operating earnings were $190 million in the fourth quarter of '11 versus the $238 million that we saw in the third quarter of '11. Higher manufacturing operating costs, really primarily associated with the unfavorable seasonal energy used, increased maintenance outage expense and lower export and pulp prices in the quarter more than offset lower input costs and seasonally stronger papers sales in Brazil, Russia and Eastern Europe. ","So the way I would talk about Printing Papers is we had strong results in Russia, Europe and Brazil. And in North America, we had a solid quarter. Third quarter was outstanding, but we did see some of these headwinds in the higher maintenance expenses. ","If you look at North America Printing Papers for the full year, you can see that we finished the year with a record return on investment of nearly 13% and improved earnings over $45 million. ","Moving on to Slide 25, an exciting piece of work that we want to mention is Franklin, Virginia, where work continues on our fluff pulp repurposing project, with very exciting crews, opened the gates for the first time in nearly 2 years as wood began to flow and to arrive in preparation for our planned midyear startup. IP is currently -- we're the third largest global supplier of fluff pulp, and this investment is going to give us greater participation in a market that's growing 4% plus.  The mill will be capable of producing 270,000 tons -- metric tons of high-quality fluff pulp for our customers across the globe. ","Moving to Page 26. Let me touch on IP India. As you know, in India integration is underway and best practice transfer is underway post our closing of Andhra Paper last quarter. And although it's still very early, we can clearly see that we've got a great opportunity for incremental opportunities to expand production, leveraging our global expertise in uncoated free sheet to take part in what's our very fast growing market, with uncoated free sheet growth of 7% to 15% in India. ","Andhra Paper noteworthy increased our revenue per ton by 12% in 2011 and operated at EBITDA margins of greater than 20%. First quarter had some noise in it, but going forward, I think the first quarter and beyond will give us a better indication of the progress and the success of Andhra Paper. ","So let me touch on xpedx. Xpedx had a strong fourth quarter, with operating earnings of $33 million compared with $27 million in the third quarter of '11. The fourth quarter costs did decrease primarily associated with the transformation initiatives and more than offset lower printing paper volumes due to fewer shipping days. ","And at this point, I'd like to turn it over to my colleague Mary Laschinger, Senior Vice President and President of xpedx to share more news about the progress we're making in transforming our distribution business.","Mary A. Laschinger","Thank you, Carol. Good morning everyone. Last April, we shared with you that xpedx had just finished a strategic assessment in our business, and that we would launch that work in 2011. And today, I'm going to provide an update on that work and the outlook for the business. But first, I wanted to take an opportunity because I believe it's important to provide some background which helps explain the opportunity available to us in the distribution business. ","On Page 28, you can see that xpedx had many acquisitions over the years, and during that time we continued to progress and had improved earnings through 2008. But it's only just been recently that we've actually achieved a single operating system to take advantage of those capabilities. On the next page, you can see that we had improvement up until 2008. 2009 not only brought a general economic decline, but it also was the beginning of a structural demand decline in print, especially in the coated grades, and that still has not recovered to pre-recession level. ","So 2010, we took the time to assess our options to reposition the business. And 2011 was all about building capabilities on how to win and making choices on where to win. And we believe through centralizing strategies with local execution, we can deliver more than $100 million of improvement over the next few years, taking the EBIT to over $200 million. ","The next few slides that I'm going to cover further explain the 3 key levers of buy, handle and sell, and how the benefits are achieved with some specific examples to show this success. And I'll finish to share with you the impact on our second half and fourth quarters specifically and the long-term outlook. ","The buy part of this business is all about building a robust capability around strategic sourcing and replenishment. We are thoroughly assessing our suppliers' capabilities. Were matching those to our customer and product needs and then making some tough choices. We're also currently in the process of upgrading our technology around our replenishment capabilities, which will improve service levels and provide robust inventory management capabilities. ","On the left-hand side of this chart I've shared with you, where we've highlighted a category within each of our focus segment of print, packaging and facility solutions, and the outcome of our first phase of work. You can see we have fewer suppliers and fewer SKUs, all of this resulting in better service to our customers, with improved product availability, better total value at a lower total cost to the enterprise. This first phase of work is just now being implemented in the 1st and 2nd quarter of 2012. ","The second key lever in our business, shown on Page 31, is all about optimizing our supply chain. It's matching our warehouse network to our customer demand and the service levels required in each segment. We are also installing warehouse and fleet management systems to optimize our national footprint. All of this, resulting in better service, higher order fuel rates and lower fixed and variable costs. The chart on the left shows our progress and our plan on revenue per square foot throughout our warehouse network, which is a productivity measure, and you can see we are making significant improvement in productivity. ","The example on the right is the success story in the repositioning of our Salt Lake City operation, where we took 4 locations, 3 brands, consolidated into one, and you can see the outstanding results. Again, this handle initiative is all about fewer, larger facilities with best-in-class capabilities, leading to better service and lower cost. ","The last key driver in our business is about making choices on where to focus and investing in growth. As you can see from the top part of this grid, we have opportunities in this business to grow, and we are investing in those segments. ","For example, in our Packaging business, we have invested in packaging design centers to support growth in specialty packaging, and we coupled that with a commodity product offering. You can see our results in 2011 have been significant, with great improvement year-over-year. But we also recognize that the commercial print segment is in decline, but we have a very large position with many strengths to win, and we're going to continue to support that segment as a core part of our business. ","Lastly, we did make some tough choices in 2011 and we are in the process of exiting some markets or segments due to either market dynamics or our assessment of our ability to win. ","Page 33, the last picture shows our progress in 2011 and the long-term outlook. As I've stated earlier, 2011 was all about building a plan and capabilities, and we began executing in late 2011 with some impact in the fourth quarter. ","We do have seasonality in this business, but our fourth quarter results were significantly better than prior years. This is a multiyear program, and we're about 3 to 6 months into the execution. But we're very confident that this business has significant potential to add value to International Paper. ","With that, I'm going to turn it back to Carol.","Carol L. Roberts","Thanks, Mary. Appreciate it. So one final update before I move on to the outlook, and then John provides the wrap up. I wanted to comment on our progress at the Ilim joint venture, specifically our Bratsk and Koryazhma mills, and those projects continue on schedule. As you can see from these pictures on Slide 24, we essentially have passed the halfway mark and remain on plan for startup in late 2012. ","And just to remind you of the scope of those projects, in the Bratsk project, we'll bring on 500,000 tons of bleached soft wood pulp, leveraging our low cost export position to China. And our new paper machine in Koryazhma will add 155,000 tons of uncoated free sheet, which will support our domestic market growth in Russia. So very exciting and on track and on plan. ","So let me take us to Slide 35 and move in to the summary of the fourth quarter and then to the outlook. As we said, we had a solid fourth quarter despite the seasonally weaker demand environment in North America that we normally experience in this timeframe. All things considered, we continue to feel more positive about the demand trend in North America, about our ability to expand margins globally and to grow our business in the emerging markets that we've invested in. ","So let me take you through a detailed look of our first quarter outlook on Slide 36. Looking ahead, the first quarter is always a seasonally slower period. With that said, we do expect modest increases in volume in North America versus the fourth quarter, primarily in Packaging -- that's primarily due to 4 more box shipping days. But we do expect an increase in exports in our paper business. ","Through January, good news is that U.S. box demand held up to what I would consider quite nicely. Although we are working with a fairly weak year-over-year comp, our box demand is up nearly 4% versus January of last year. ","Moving on to pricing. The continued pass-through of previously negotiated export price reductions really in packaging, containerboard and in paper and pulp will materially impact realizations in the first quarter. ","And additionally in Brazil, seasonally weaker domestic demand -- that will result in us shipping a greater percentage of lower-priced paper exports, which will be a drag on earnings. As to inputs, we see slightly higher costs in North America, primarily wood, energy and chemical, which will largely offset the benefit of some lower outage expense. And it's fairly new news today, but OCC just came out today, and it's up anywhere from $10 to $15 for February. ","Xpedx earnings will decrease as the quarter is just seasonally a slower shipping period for the distribution business. On a positive note contribution from our Ilim joint venture will improve and that's really based largely on the absence of the negative currency impact that we experienced in the fourth quarter. I would point out that our run rate earnings coming out of this currency issue will reflect about the half of the peak level that will be saw earlier in 2011, which is a result of the full impact of the pulp price erosion for the period. ","And lastly, I'd like to point out that manufacturing operations and all other costs associated with the businesses will be impacted in the quarter versus the fourth quarter. Essentially, there's 4 major buckets, each worth between $10 million to $25 million of incremental expense in the quarter, and let me take you through those. ","First we do expect one-time cost in the first quarter associated with the pending startups later this year at both Franklin and our Sun joint venture. The second, we talked about it, but there are seasonally higher costs related to the consumption of energy, fuel, primarily due to the colder weather, that will create some headwind for our manufacturing operations. ","Third, one-time annual true-ups that we experienced in the fourth quarter, largely related to company-paid benefits. We do not expect that to repeat in the first quarter. ","And finally, the company's favorable experience related to last year's inventory reevaluations will not occur -- will not reoccur in the first quarter, impacting first quarter earnings. ","So at this point, what I would like to do is turn the call back to you, John.","John V. Faraci","Good, Carol, thanks. Carol just covered the outlook. So let me talk more about just extending the outlook beyond the first quarter and the full year. ","Looking at the U.S. economy, I think recovering but far for from fully recovered. The economic growth, we've got some growth, but it's still a lot slower than we'd all like to see. So we see modest demand growth in IP business segments, mostly continuing to be driven by the growth in emerging markets. None of us have a great crystal ball in input costs, but as far as we can see -- with what we can see, I'd say our view on input costs is more or less stable. There's certainly is moderate inflation in the U.S. economy. ","Inventories are in good shape. We're going to get the realization of high-return cost reduction projects, most of that in the second half of the year, and I'll talk about those in a minute. The major earnings runway drivers that kind of ramp up in the second half of the year, the most significant one being Temple-related synergies. We are going to have some higher pension costs during the year and interest in tax expenses, which are covered in the appendix. ","So let me go and just talk about capital for a minute. We discussed -- if you look at this chart, it shows our capital spending over the last 7 or 8 years and then the 2008 to '12 average, which is how we think about capital over a cycle. We're going to spend more money in 2012. The $1.3 billion before Temple, probably close to $1.5 billion with Temple, fairly close to depreciation, whether it be big capital spending year. The 2008 to '12, capital spending -- cycle spending will be below depreciation -- well below depreciation, as we said, about 75% over that period. ","So we've got an impressive backlog of high-return projects, and we're going to begin to fund those. We'll start funding in 2011 aggressively, we're going to continue to fund those aggressively in 2012. And if you go to the next slide, what you see are these projects, and they really fall into 4 categories, the biggest one being energy consumption. No matter where we are, whether it's Russia, Brazil or the U.S., reducing energy consumption are really high payback return projects. As you can see, we're going to spend close to $190 million this year on cost reduction projects. ","Turning to Slide 42, the major earnings run rate drivers we see as we look out not only in 2012 but beyond are, first, the Temple acquisition. As Carol said, we're very confident about the $300 million of synergies, more confident now that we've been in the Temple facilities. That's going to start to impact us right away after closing, which we think is not too far away. The Franklin soft pulp conversion is also going to start to impact the company positively in the second half of the year and in 2013. You heard Mary talk about the xpedx transformation, which is starting to produce results, and those will accelerate as we get to the back half of 2012. ","The capital projects that are coming on in the markets where we need capacity, Russia and China, are going to be coming on stream at the end of the year and really start to impact International Paper in a positive way as we move into 2013. And finally, the APPM acquisition, which we'll talk to you more about probably at the end of the first quarter on our Investor Day, we think is a terrific opportunity for International Paper to build a platform that will give us earnings, sales and expansion over the next 5 years. ","So summing up our priorities, as we think about International Paper, before we kind of take your questions, remain very consistent. We're going to continue to grow strong, sustainable free cash flow, be very disciplined in how we spend money to do that. Our objectives are to extend our margins and earnings in all of our businesses, achieving cycle average of returns above the cost of capital, maintain a strong balance sheet and continue to use that free cash flow in a balanced way to fund good cost reduction projects, delivering on our strategic initiatives, paying down the debt associated with Temple to maintain a strong balance sheet. And finally, but importantly, increasing the dividend over time as sustainable free cash flow permits. ","So with that, I think I will turn it back over to all of you to ask your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of George Staphos of Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, first question on exports in containerboard. I think earlier in the slide deck, you show about $6 million of price reduction for the Industrial Packaging business. Should we assume that most of that was related to exports? And can you comment at all what type of trend you're seeing more recently terms of export pricing in containerboard.","John V. Faraci","George, so most of that was export related and I'll let Mark Sutton, who's here, who runs the Industrial Packaging business now just comment on what we see in the marketplace today.","Mark Stephan Sutton","It was all export. In the fourth quarter, we lost about $28 a ton in export, and we've seen that continues a little bit more into January. But we believe it's pretty much hitting a bottom and firming up. There are even a couple of cases with some export markets, where we've actually -- we see price increases as we go through January. So I think we hopefully are seeing the bottom of that.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mark, would it be fair to say that you're seeing some pickup in South American export pricing? Or is that too simplistic?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Probably too simplistic. We're still -- we're still working through our customer activity in South America, but the one area we have seen firming in somewhat of a reversal is more in our Mediterranean basin region.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Two last ones, and I'll turn it over. If we think about the bleached board market, certainly it would appear from the data that you shared, you're comfortable with your performance versus the market. It is a smaller market, though, say versus containerboard. And you are seeing capacity coming on not necessarily in North America, obviously, but around the world. The decline that we saw in the fourth quarter, how comfortable are you that's really more seasonal and\/or cyclical and not the beginning of a more structural issue you need to deal with within coated paperboard.","John V. Faraci","Tom, you want to comment on that? Tom Kadien runs our Consumer Packaging business, which includes coated paperboard.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Yes, we saw the industry backlogs here in North America start to fall in October, and I would say they kind of bounced along the bottom in October and November. But we've actually seen some improvements in backlog since then, and I'd say for the last 3 weeks we felt very good about the demand. So I think from a North American perspective, the demand, I'll say, softness is behind us and we feel much better about the first quarter. I guess, from a structural standpoint, I think I don't think we have a structural issue. I think we just had an inventory correction and some slowdown in the segments that we participate in, but it seems like we're headed in the right direction this year.","John V. Faraci","We export about 20% of what we make in Coated Paperboard, and we're very targeted and selective about putting that volume to customers that need an SDS product. So while, yes, there is capacity being added around the world, we think we got the right customer base in the export markets to support that kind of position going forward.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Carol, last question. On the appendix, you note the tax rate guidance is trending higher interest expense and corporate expenses well versus 2011. Can you give us kind of a quick overview why those are trending higher?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, the tax rate simply just geographic mix post Temple and then we're just going to have more of a U.S-based business-based relative to the Corporate. And I know Glenn can take you guys through more detail, but that's simply pension expense is going to be high. The biggest driver is pension expense is going to be higher. And of course, the net interest expense is all around our Temple-Inland work. But Glenn can take you through any other details you might need on that.","John V. Faraci","And remember that pension expense is not cash.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wondered if we could start out. I noticed in Containerboard, really you took a lot of downtime -- market downtime in the fourth quarter. And I wondered if you can give us a little color where you're taking it and whether that's continuing in January, or whether you're running a little fuller as you try to build those inventories that Carol talked about?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Mark, this is Mark Sutton. On the market downtime, as you know, we run to our customer base, the needs of our customer base, and we took what we took in the fourth quarter simply to match what our customer demands were. And really, we tend to take it based on our flexible system, so we take the downtime in the most cost-effective way, as one of the benefits of having a system as flexible as ours. So we took some of that downtime in some of the recycled mills. And we are running stronger in the beginning of this year so far.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And Mark, you mentioned in the release a couple of times the improved performance in European container. Is that simply a result of European containerboard prices having fallen so much in the fourth quarter?","John V. Faraci","Yes what that is, Mark, is you've got board prices fell, and with the customer base we've had, we've gotten some margin expansion because prices haven't.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just, John, just a couple of questions about some of these offshore operations. First of all, it seems like there's a lot of restructuring going on in the European containerboard and corrugated business. And I wondered if we could get your thoughts on your business in Europe and your strategy.","John V. Faraci","Well, we've got a great corrugated business in Southern Europe, North Africa and Turkey. It's focused on fruit and vegetables. It's not insulated from what's going on in Spain and Italy. We have an industrial business there. It's not integrated in the sense that we buy all our containerboard. A lot of the virgin linerboard that we need for fruit and vegetables comes from International Paper, so to that degree, think of it as an extension of our integration here in North America. There is some consolidation, as you pointed out, but I think is -- we'll see how that plays out. Our business over there is a $1 billion business. And we like it; we'd like to grow it if the right opportunity arises. But we're not focused on growing our business in Western Europe, either in packaging or in paper. Our tilt is more to the east, in Russia.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then down in China, in the Sun JV, the EBIT margins there continue to be quite low despite you guys having built a lot of new modern equipment over there. I wondered if you could just talk about the sort of the year outlook for where margin should trend in China over time. And also talk about how your funding this latest machine within the JV.","John V. Faraci","Well, let me just comment on margins, and then Tom or Carol can talk about how we're funding it. I mean, the China business model is different than for just about every business we're in different in the rest of the world. The margins are lower because it's the most competitive market we're in anywhere, but the capital turnover is a lot higher. we're building capacity over there for, in some cases, less than 50% of what it would cost in Brazil or Europe or North America. We've got a great example of that. We built a paper machine in Brazil, the same time we built a coated board machine in China, and we saw the difference in the capital cost. And that's what that means is you can make good returns with lower margins. And fortunately that's the case because China is just so competitive. These markets are big and growing that margins are lower.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And would you expect those margins to improve from where they're at right now, about 4%?","John V. Faraci","The margins are better, I think, in the Bleached Board business, with 4%, maybe an aggregate. Therefore, I don't see anything changing in China to make China less competitive than it is. Every time I go there, I see more competitors.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Mark, this is Tom Kadien. What we see is coated paperboard prices in China do tend to follow pulp because there's a fair amount of nonintegrated capacity over there. Margins came under pressure in the second half of last year for that reason, as well as a lot of extra capacity coming online. So I would say, we're kind of -- we're probably a little bit past the bottom on the margin side at the Sun JV. And for the full year, we had a very good year, a double-digit ROI on the investment. And to John's point about the capital turns, they're over 3 on the JV. So the margins don't tell the whole story.","John V. Faraci","That's our new capital, so you'll be looking at capital turnover probably 0.8 here in North America. From a funding standpoint, we own 55% of that joint venture, so our partner contributed real estate and infrastructure, and we contributed cash. And we're generating cash in that business up until a point in time we had to put some -- and put the capital out to fund the project, which is roughly..","Thomas Gustave Kadien","It's under $300 million.","John V. Faraci","$300 million.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","For the whole project. And then the JV borrows the majority of the funds.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In terms of containerboard, it sounds like you are running a bit more full here in the first quarter, but if I add it up last year, there's about 380,000 tons of market-related downtime. So I guess, I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about that flex capacity at this stage. Obviously it's upside as markets recover, but is there a point where you consider that as more of the cost-reduction opportunity, considering you have capacity creep every year through your own productivity?","Mark Stephan Sutton","So Phil, this is Mark. I think the way we think about it is this system is pretty large at International Paper, and last year as you quoted, it was 380,000 tons. When you look at the flexibility of our system and the size of it and the constant work we do to select customers across the globe, especially for the kraft linerboard, we view that as something we can do at an ongoing way. And demand as you said in North America would take a big hit out of that. But we already tried to optimize how we take the downtime, and actually, we've gotten pretty good at it in terms of doing it in the most cost-effective way.","John V. Faraci","Phil, let me just add to that. If you think about our channel access, our market access, we've got a big position in export markets. That's a 4 million-ton market. It's growing faster than North American box consumption. And that's where we're targeting our virgin linerboard. And we're more than willing to take temporary downtime because we think the U.S. market is growing over time. We are going to get back -- box demand will get back to pre-recession levels. And as Mark said, with the flexible system we have, more flexible system now, the cost of taking temporary downtime as opposed to kind of long-term downtime -- or structural downtime, is a cost that is quite low. So I think we're well advantaged to having this multiple market strategy to be able to manage through times when there's a bit of excess capacity.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question is over the past 2 quarters, the domestic demand on containerboard has held up a lot better than the domestic demand for bleached board. And as the industry leader in both, I was wondering if you could share any observations as to why that might be perhaps by certain and markets or otherwise.","John V. Faraci","We've been asking ourselves that question, and we frankly we don't have a real good answer. In some inventory destocking, we think, in the bleached board business, but yet, there's no question. If you look at corrugated shipments, you look at bleached board shipments, you'd say the 2 in the fourth quarter didn't really move in the same direction. As Tom said, we're feeling more optimistic about the paperboard backlogs and shipments as we go into 2012.","Carol L. Roberts","The other observation, Phil, is if you take it over a longer period of time, they start to look closer. And the Containerboard business is just a much shorter-cycle business. So you see the changes in the supply chain. It reacts much faster because you can't store corrugated. And in the Coated Paperboard business as any of these markets, the cycle time and the supply chain is just longer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman of UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Carol, I apologize if you quantified these numbers, but you had mentioned something about those true-ups in inventory adjustments that seem to benefit the fourth quarter. I was wondering if you could quantify them if you haven't.","Carol L. Roberts","Gail, this is Carol. As I stated, there's kind of buckets of those, and some of those buckets were in the $10 million to $25 million of expense range. So that kind of gives you a range. And what I'd do I'd say that we could follow up just with Glenn to see if there's any more detail in that. But I think that kind of gives you the directionality of those in the magnitude that you need.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And can you just remind us what your policy is on natural gas hedging and to what extent the recent declines may or may not flow through?","John V. Faraci","It's been pretty good shape to see the steady downdraft of natural gas hit the bottom line because, for all intents and purposes, we're just about 100% spot now. But we're hedging in the past, and we've let those hedges run off, Gail.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I think a new competitor had a favorable ruling from the IRS in terms of fuel tax credits. And I'm just wondering if you could give us an update if there's any kind of incremental potential benefit that could come to you?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, Gail, this is Carol. We also filed our amended return for the summer, and we booked a reserve against that. So the ball is kind of in the IRS court, and we're waiting on their determination. So in the meantime, we just wait and see, and I think that was -- we've disclosed that. I think it was in the $660 million range.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question. I guess you're seeing OCC move up a little bit, and I'm just wondering, is that a driver -- is that being driven by, I guess, pickup in China? And maybe some insights into what you're seeing in your Chinese box business and what that might mean for OCC moving forward?","Mark Stephan Sutton","This is Mark. That's definitely a part of it, and we expected to see that because what happened in the drop off really was a lack of Chinese demand. So we are seeing that pickup and seeing the expected rise in OCC cost.","John V. Faraci","Tom, do you want to comment on how you see box demand in China?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Yes, we saw box demand slow down in the second half of the year, kind of mirroring everything you read about economic activity over there. On the other -- and what we didn't see, what we normally see is a bit of a buildup before Chinese New Year in inventories, and folks did not do that over in China. Now we're out of Chinese New Year now, and I think we expected it will start to pick back up again. But it was slower in the second half, more like a plus 5% then plus 10% in the box market that we have been experiencing.","John V. Faraci","Yes. We still think that China is going to grow at 5-plus percent in terms of box consumption, and it's a 40 million ton market. So those are big numbers, even though it's not the kind of numbers we're looking at maybe 2 years ago.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","One thing that we're noticing is that depreciation and amortization seems to be coming down, which is obviously a benefit to earnings. I noticed in the quarters year-over-year, it was down $40 million, like 10%, and you're guiding to 1.2x Temple versus 1.5x in 2010. Could you give us give us a little color as to what's causing that? I guess, maybe some runoff of previous acquisition, accelerated depreciation? And sort of how we could expect that to progress with or without on a post-Temple or a pre-Temple basis?","Carol L. Roberts","Well, Chip, this is Carol. I think what you're seeing is you're seeing that depreciation is coming off from warehouse or where that's coming down.  Depreciation coming down from there. You'll also see the result of the capital spending, and we've been spending less in the last few years. So I think it works itself out over time. But I don't think there's anything more extraordinary or dramatic from that, than that.","John V. Faraci","And Chip, we'll have to go through kind of the whole asset allocation issue with Temple, which probably is going to result in step up of assets, which will lead to higher depreciation again. But if you think about our capital spending, our target had been 75% depreciation over the last cycle and we're not going to be over depreciation in this coming cycle. But we'll share a bit more of that with you when we get to Investor Day.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And sort of on that score, we are seeing sort of above your average level this year, as you've guided us. And we have another player out there that just recently made a big acquisition that sort of stepped up the CapEx for a year after that closed. It seems, though, that your situation is a little different. Should we expect sort of post-Temple for your CapEx to still sort of be kind of at a peak-ish level in '12 and '13 and then likely come down a little bit, all things being equal?","John V. Faraci","Well, in '12, we got these projects we're talking about, the Franklin project, we've got the Sun project, that are expansion projects. Plus we have $200 million of cost production projects, which don't have any volume associated with them. You'll have to see how the Boiler MACT regulations get played out, but that's the wave of capital that is going to hit the industry that we haven't had in the last 5 or 6 years. And we'll quantify that for you and share with you on Investor Day. At that point in time, we'll know more.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And one last one. With the increasing corporate expense of about $75 million, is most of that tied to the pension increase? Or I'll ask it differently: is any of the pension increase going to be allocated to the segments?","Carol L. Roberts","Most of that is the pension increase, Chip.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","But some of the pension increase will also show up in the segments, is that fair?","Carol L. Roberts","No, this particular part of the expense, we keep on that corporate line.","Operator","Your next question comes from Al Kabili of Credit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I've been bounced around calls, so I apologize if some of these have been addressed. But I guess, first is on bleached capacity in China, we're seeing a meaningful ramp, I guess, there. One, is how are you feeling about the returns on the expansion on the Sun JV. And then two, if you could talk about maybe any risk you see or addressing the risk of some of that coming into North America.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","It's Tom Kadien. Relative to the returns, our business at the Sun JV really plays in the higher-end, higher-priced, more technical grades, around food and beverage and antiseptic. And I think where we're at, where we've positioned ourselves purposely because of the excess capacity, is to move as much of our mix up there where others typically don't play. So 60% of our mix at the JV is up at the higher end. And mostly, I'll say insulated from a lot of that capacity that's coming in folding boxboard. Now that said, there's still kind of a second effect, the pressure. So we saw some of that in the second half of last year, but I think long term, we still look at the investment on PM26 as being a double-digit kind of return, and we have to work through some of this excess capacity in coated board. But the market is still growing 8% to 10% over there, and that will chew up a bunch of that pretty quickly. Relative to the impact on the U.S., I think it's relatively minor. We see some of it coming in, and I'll say in sheet form for commercial printing applications but not a lot of tons, and it shouldn't impact our business much here in the U.S. at all. I'm talking about the excess in China capacity.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could ask a question for Carol. I don't know if you could quantify the pension expense is incremental pension expense this year and also what that means. How should we be thinking about corporate expense this year?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, Al. And just to clarify that, what we keep at corporate is the investment performance, and the service cost, which is much more of a flatter number, stays out of the business. And I think if you look in the appendix, I think on Page 43, there is some data or, 44, and I think the majority of the increase in the corporate item is in that pension expense, which is investment performance related.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And for 2012, how should we be thinking about corporate expense?","Carol L. Roberts","On that chart, it's $220 million.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","$220 million. Okay.","Carol L. Roberts","All that stuff is in the appendix. So there's even some more detail. And if you have any questions, of course, you can follow up with us.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I apologize, I missed it.","Carol L. Roberts","That's okay. No problem, Al.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, the final question, maybe for John. Again, I apologize if you've addressed this already. But the inventory levels and industry inventory levels in the U.S. on containerboard, how are you feeling about those and your own inventory?","John V. Faraci","I feel good about them. But I let Mark Sutton talk how he sees from his perspectives since he's running the business.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Yes, I think I would agree with John's comment. The inventory levels are in the normal range, both measured and absolute, in the number of weeks. What rise we've seen has been pretty clearly discussed as bills for outages and specific needs. So I think we feel pretty good about the overall level. Our inventories were flat in the fourth quarter. And as Carol mentioned, we do have some maintenance outages in the first 2 quarters, obviously, and we will have some bill to deal with that. And we're expecting, based on the way the weather has played out, a stronger agricultural fees, and so we want to be prepared for that to be successful there even though we have some maintenance outages.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Looking at 2011. I guess U.S. uncoated free sheet volumes were down 3% industry-wide. As you look at 2012, is there any reason to think that those volumes could be materially better or worse than 2011? And just a follow-up on the quarter, it seems like you're free sheet volumes were flat year-over-year, which I think is a little bit better than the industry. Would you give a little color there as well?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Anthony, it's Tim. Most of the third-party forecasts that I've seen for this year are showing about a 3% decline forecasted. We'll have to see what impact the election and some of the other 2012 events, how they impact the market. But we're not seeing anything dramatically different for 2012 than we saw in 2011.","John V. Faraci","One of the things is it's structural. It won't last forever, but as unemployment comes down, one of the biggest drivers of cut-size consumption, which is the biggest segment of uncoated free sheet is white-collar employment. And that's still then strictly high. And if that comes down, you would expect to see some offset to the structural decline in uncoated free sheet be offset a bit.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the containerboard side, you've had competitors that have announced or completed large projects that are going to try to move them down the cost curve. And I was wondering if you could discuss your overall cost position in North America and maybe what steps you can take. You referenced the $190 million in capital projects, the Temple integration. What steps can you take to protect your cost advantage, and just sort of how you think about that?","John V. Faraci","Well, I'd say that there's no company that's got the opportunities that International Paper has. If you think about opportunities to improve the cost structure with the Temple integration, there's $300 million there that we can see just in integration opportunities. And then as we deal with the warehouses, the whole re-optimization platform that's significantly different fast-forward in 2013  than the one we have today. So I think International Paper, because we made these opportunities for ourselves, it's got far more leverage to pull than anybody has in the world to kind of manage our own cost structure and improve it. And whether that's in Ilim, with the Bratsk project, the Temple integration, we've got a big energy project going on in Brazil that's going to make Mogi Gua\u00e7u totally non-dependent on fossil fuel. It would be all wood fiber or biomass. Those types of things we've got going on all around the world. We're just about to start up a new turbine project in Svetogorsk, which is going to significantly reduce our energy costs. So we're pulling those levers everywhere, and we got more from the pull than anybody else does.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you give any kind of guidance about what portion of that $190 million would be going towards North American containerboard?","Carol L. Roberts","It's probably in -- I don't have that exact number -- this is Carol. But it's probably in the $40 million range.","Operator","Our final question will be coming from the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Three clarifications. First on the black liquor question, which Gail had brought up. I believe in the case of Capstone, they basically would be reversing a liability, so there wasn't going to be any cash coming to them. I don't see that you have a liability. So in your case, if you were to get _ a similar ruling, would that actually mean that you would get cash coming to you?","Carol L. Roberts","We basically paid the taxes on the gain we got when we had the black liquor credit and therefore, we've kind of believed in the beginning that it was not taxable. But we did indeed paid the tax on it. And so now we're coming back and saying we're amending the tax return. Gee, that shouldn't have been taxed. And so how that comes back to us in the form of either refund or deferred -- another tax credit in other way, it will come back to us over time.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. Second, Carol, when you were referencing Page 36, you threw 4 items that you were truing up. You zipped through those pretty quick. It sounds like 2 of them were positive 4Q to 1Q, and 2 of them negative. Did I just hear that right?","Carol L. Roberts","I don't think you've captured that correctly, Mark. Sorry. They're all negative. They're all going in the opposite direction, in the negative direction. More costs for the startups, higher costs for the consumption of energy and fuel, and there were some positive in '11 that do not repeat in '12.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Got it. Okay. And then lastly in terms of the $300 million synergies that you reiterated. Again, I take it that that's, is that not that dependent on the specifics of the pending binding documentation with DOJ?","John V. Faraci","I'm thinking about both of those synergies are, Mark, they're related to eliminating duplication, combining 2 companies that have a lot of duplication. And the other part are, we said that having fewer box plants at the end of the day. So that's what we see as the main portion of the synergies. And based on what we've seen in Temple, because we put together an estimate, without having visited any facilities. Now we've been to all the mills. We feel very good about that $300 million number. ","Okay. Well, listen. That wraps it up, and let me just summarize. I think International Paper finished a very good year. In fact, last year, we had almost 2 decades on a strong note. We're in a seasonally slow time of the year. But we're very positive about the prospects for International Paper to flow through 2012. Having said that, we're looking forward to talking to you about the Temple integration on our next conference call. So thank you.","Glenn Landau","Thanks, John. And of course, Investor Relations and Media Relations are available on the phone numbers on our website after the call. Have a good day, everyone.","Operator","Thank you.

And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. Guillermo Gutierrez. Please go ahead, sir.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning. And thank you for joining International Paper's fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide two of our presentation. We will also present certain non-US GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to US GAAP financial measures is available on our website.","Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim joint venture, slide four provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining International Paper's fourth quarter and 2017 full year earnings call. I'm going to start on slide five. International Paper delivered a strong year of performance in 2017. When we entered 2017, we said it would be a year of two halves. And we made a commitment to a strong second half performance in order to deliver more than 10% EBITDA growth for the year.","I'm very pleased to share with you today that we delivered 16% EBITDA growth in 2017, excluding the Consumer Packaging business, which we are recording as discontinued operation. The 16% EBITDA growth includes 10% of organic earnings growth and 6% from earnings growth related to the pulp acquisition.","Including Consumer Packaging, we delivered $3.9 billion in EBITDA in 2017 or a 13% year-over-year growth. Our performance was driven by excellent commercial execution across our businesses and solid synergy realization in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. We continue to grow value for our shareholders with an ROIC of 10%, solidly exceeding our cost of capital. We also made substantial progress on many fronts, including the outstanding integration of our Global Cellulose Fibers business, as well as accelerating strategic investments for growth in Industrial Packaging.","We also made an important strategic move in Consumer Packaging that further enables us to focus on growing value in our core businesses. We generated strong free cash flow of $2 billion in 2017, which enabled us to strengthen our balance sheet and increase our dividend for the sixth consecutive year. I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight the continued strong performance at our Ilim JV, which delivered solid operational and financial results and provided more than $130 million in cash dividends in International Paper in 2017. So overall, I feel very good about what we accomplished in 2017. And as importantly, I'm really excited about how we are positioned as we enter 2018.","Turning to our full-year results on slide six, and I'll remind you again that Consumer Packaging is now reflected in our financials as discontinued operations from 2013 onwards. Do keep in mind that our free cash flow does include discontinued operations. For 2017, we grew revenue by 11%, driven by the pulp acquisition and excellent commercial performance across our businesses, with improvements in volume, pricing, and mix. And those improvements accelerated throughout the year. This enabled us to offset significantly higher average for recovered fiber cost and other input cost headwinds such as transportation to grow our margins and deliver solid earnings and free cash flow in 2017.","Moving to slide seven. International Paper continues to be a strong and sustainable cash generator, which enables us to execute our strategy and optimize capital allocation to continue growing value for our shareholders.","On slide eight, International Paper delivered another strong year of return on invested capital, with a 300 basis point spread to our weighted average cost of capital. This marks our eighth consecutive year of value-creating returns for our shareholders.","I'll now turn it over to Glenn, who will cover the performance across our businesses and a few other financial topics, including our first quarter outlook. Glenn?","Glenn Landau","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on slide nine in the presentation, which shows our full-year operating earnings per share bridge from 2016 to 2017. Notably, as you can see, price and mix improvements played an important role in our earnings growth in 2017 and was largely driven by realization-associated increases announced in our North American Industrial Packaging and Global Fibers businesses earlier in the year.","Operations, on the other hand, were negatively impacted by two significant hurricane events and the interruption of production at Pensacola. Our maintenance outages in legacy operations were a partial offset. Our reported higher outages in our acquired pulp business are captured in the pulp acquisition column. Input costs were clear and sustained headwind through most of 2017, driven by significantly higher recovered fiber cost, OCC on year-over-year basis, along with higher energy and transportation costs, especially during the latter part of the year.","Moving across the bridge, I'll point out the negative swing at Ilim. It was due primarily to FX. And lastly, we have the baseline carryover benefit of the pulp acquisition whose positive contribution accelerated as the year progressed.","Now, let's turn to slide 10 and focus on our results for the fourth quarter that show a strong finish to a solid year. International Paper delivered record operating EPS in the fourth quarter of $1.27 and continued to see healthy demand in US and globally. Our North American Industrial Packaging business and Global Cellulose Fibers business both had record volumes in the quarter. And we benefited from the full realization of first half price increases and continued price gains in export markets across our portfolio.","Global Cellulose again outpaced our plan, delivering more synergies and faster. And our Ilim JV delivered strong performance, with $64 million in equity earnings underlying the strength of that platform. All-in, we had another very solid quarter capped with stronger free cash flow and generation.","Moving to the quarter-over-quarter EPS bridge on slide 11. We saw more price realization in the fourth quarter, now driven by further gains in containerboard exports and higher prices across all pulp grades. Volume was strong as well, with record shipments in North America box, containerboard exports, and our pulp grades in the quarter. Unlike the year-over-year trend, inputs provided some relief in the fourth quarter as OCC moved off its historical highs established in third quarter. This was partially offset though by seasonally higher wood costs, higher chemical costs, and higher transportation associated pipe rail and truck capacity. And lastly, Ilim delivered sequentially stronger results on higher pricing and solid demand.","Relative to our segment performance, I'll start with Industrial Packaging on page 12. As I already mentioned, we realized meaningful price gains in containerboard exports and solid demand across all international channels, backstopped by record shipments in North America box. Baseline operations improved sequentially as well, even excluding the non-repeating items of both the hurricane impact in the third quarter and the benefit of the final tranche of Pensacola insurance recovery of $14 million in the fourth quarter.","Maintenance outage expense decreased by $10 million as we had our lowest maintenance outage quarter of the year. And input cost improved as OCC pulled back from the third quarter historical high. Although partially offset by seasonally higher wood costs and very difficult transportation operations, primarily availability, which again reflects the strong underlying demand environment, which we are experiencing.","Taking a closer look at our Industrial Packaging business in the fourth quarter. Our margins expanded meaningfully, as expected, driven by several factors. First, we continue to see strong global demand for our corrugated packaging, as reflected by record shipments in North America box and containerboard exports in the fourth quarter.","Second, our multi-channel go-to-market strategy continues to be an important driver of our platform performance. These channels to market, which include the integrated box business and our domestic and export containerboard segment, provide choices for International Paper to maximize value. This was especially evident in the fourth quarter where we saw a significant margin expansion, largely due to higher realized prices.","And lastly, I want to address our industrial packaging mill optimization initiatives. We've now brought online about half of the 250,000 tons of capacity we announced in 2015. This added capacity is not only providing us with the needed flexibility to optimize our product and geographic mix, it has enabled us to keep up with strong and steady market growth, no more apparent than in the fourth quarter.","So now, moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on page 14. This business delivered solid results in the fourth quarter, with earnings of $98 million and an EBITDA margin of nearly 23%. This was driven by outstanding commercial performance, driving price and mix improvement across the portfolio. We continue to see strong demand across all grades, but particularly in our fluff segment. Executing our plan to qualify our Riegelwood 18 machine on fluff on an accelerated basis allowed us to serve the growing demand from our customers and increase our mix towards more fluff pulp, ultimately providing margin uplift better than planned. And on the synergy front, we again accelerated our realizations in the fourth quarter. And I will come back to that with some more color on the next slide.","Moving on, and with full transparency, fourth quarter operations did benefit by $15 million from the inventory valuation associated with our LIFO accounting convention. And maintenance outage expenses remained low during the fourth quarter. And input costs were moderately higher on seasonal wood costs. All in, we are very pleased with the progress made integrating the Global Cellulose Fibers business. And just to make one underlying before we move on, we are extremely well positioned to service our customers globally and have made outstanding progress in bringing synergies to the bottom line. I do want to point out though, as we enter 2018, we do have higher maintenance expenses planned. And we will have a significant step-up in corporate allocations to this business, impacting reported results only at the segment level.","Turning to slide 15 and taking a closer look at Global Cellulose Fiber synergies. The business delivered very strong performance in the fourth quarter, capturing $53 million across the enterprise and bringing the full year to $155 million. You will recall that our original 2018 exit target was $175 million, which we then revised upward to $200 million. We can say proudly that we are closing 2017 at $205 million run rate, exceeding our target a year ahead of plan.","In summary, we are capturing more synergies faster, exceeded our target and, therefore, have executed in a central pillar of our earnings growth commitment associated with this acquisition. With that, we officially close out our synergy reporting and move to the next step of further optimization. And as you can see in the table, meaningful optimization opportunities are still in front of us in 2018 and beyond, particularly in manufacturing supply chain operations.","Moving to Printing Papers. Results came in better than expected on improved commercial performance, particularly in Brazil, where we benefited from stronger-than-expected seasonal volume gains, better mix, directly correlated with higher domestic net demand. We also saw realization in the quarter across all our paper segments, confirming more recent initiatives have good traction on price.","Maintenance outage expenses were higher than the third quarter, as expected. And input costs were impacted by higher wood costs, particularly in Russia operations, as well as higher pulp costs in Brazil. So coming back to North America, our operations were impacted by seasonally higher operating costs and unusually cold weather, as well as higher distribution cost due to the constrained availability of trucking options in this environment.","Now, on to Ilim on page 17, that JV delivered very solid results, driven by higher pricing and strong volumes, only partly offset by higher seasonal wood and energy costs. There were no maintenance outage expenses during the quarter. And our equity earnings benefited from a non-cash FX gain on the JV's US-denominated debt.","Turning to the balance sheet, on page 18. During 2017, although we expected, we delivered step-change progress towards bringing our leverage ratio back to our stated target of less than 3 times debt to EBITDA on a moving adjusted basis. Our pension gap decreased by $1.4 billion on a $1.25 billion voluntary pension contribution, which was partially funded by a $1 billion debt issuance at very attractive terms. Internal to the plan, very strong pension plan investment returns were only partially offset by a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate.","Further, and as I've - we discussed earlier, during 2017, we took meaningful measures to derisk the plan, including transferring approximately $1.3 billion of pension benefit obligations to a third party, effectively reducing the cost of our PBTC insurance premiums. Going forward, we will remain fully committed to a strong balance sheet. And as we enter 2018, we will continue to deleverage by paying down additional debt in order to meet our commitments and sustain our investment-grade credit rating.","On slide 19, I want to take this opportunity to update you on the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to International Paper. First and foremost, with regard to border tax policy, our position has been clear. Tax policy should help drive economic growth and level the playing field with competitors around the world. While a lot has been achieved here, we continue to evaluate the impact of these significant changes and many smaller changes to International Paper. But there is no question, the main impact to us is the headline corporate tax rate, which moves from 35% to 21%.","Correspondingly, you will notice that we recognized a $1.2 billion non-cash benefit in special items in the fourth quarter, which includes the remeasurement of our US deferred taxes to the new corporate tax rate. I'll remind you that we do not have any US federal NOL carryover. So essentially, International Paper is a full taxpayer of tax. Of course, we also pay state and local taxes, which takes our projected global operational tax rate to approximately 25% to 27% in 2018. Another important impact of the tax reform to International Paper is the accelerated depreciation, which will allow us to develop the full amount of our US-based capital investments within the same year through 2022 versus 50% previously.","Lastly, relative to the repatriation of cash, also known as the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, this means we are no longer taxed when bringing cash back from our foreign subsidy. With that said, we do have to pay for this flexibility. And we currently estimate this cost, net of foreign tax credits, to be approximately $200 million to be paid over the next eight years. Net-net, however, this flexibility is a strong positive to International Paper. All in, we expect a positive cash tax impact exceeding $200 million in '18 and beyond.","Now, turning to our first quarter outlook on page 20. We expect to see a $10 million benefit from additional price realization in containerboard exports and a $5 million benefit on improved pricing in our Paper segment associated with announced 2017 increases. Volume will be down seasonally versus the fourth quarter as we go into this normally slower period and, therefore, expect a $40 million impact in North America Industrial Packaging and a $20 million impact in Brazil paper. We will also see a modest decrease in Global Cellulose Fibers of about $10 million, driven by the impact of Chinese New Year.","Our North American mill operation is affected by the severe weather experienced at the beginning of this year, summing to a cumulative impact of $35 million, primarily in our Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers businesses. And also, recall that during the fourth quarter, our North American Industrial Packaging business had a $14 million insurance recovery payment for Pensacola. And our Global Cellulose Fibers business had a $15 million benefit for inventory valuation, LIFO. But this is more about timing. And neither of these items will repeat in the first quarter.","During the first quarter, we will also see $15 million higher cost in our European packaging business, primarily related to the Madrid mill startup. Given our uneven outage schedule, planned maintenance outage expenses will increase by $145 million in the first quarter. And further, input costs will be a headwind of $35 million across our business, driven by our higher wood, energy, and transportation costs.","Lastly, in the other items category, we include corporate expense, interest expense, tax rate, and the equity earnings from our Ilim JV and our ownership interest in Graphic Packaging. Although here that our equity earnings from Graphic Packaging will be before tax. And the effect of approximately 1% is included in our tax outlook.","Net-net, we are off to a strong start in the first quarter, despite seasonal and timing noise. And our confidence in the full year remains robust.","Turning to slide 21. You can see some of our key planning assumptions for 2018. As stated previously, we expect higher maintenance outage expenses due to the impact of an 18-month cycle and extended averages at several mills, all of which is an investment in the future, as we position them for longer maintenance cycle schedules, saving cost in future periods.","For more specificity, you can find the 2018 quarterly maintenance cost by business on page 27 of the appendix. And as has become the norm, it is important to point that more than 70% of our average are planned during the first half of the year. Relative to capital expenditures, we have allocated $1.5 billion for 2018, including $500 million in strategic capital, as we fund value-creating opportunities in our core growth businesses, which I will discuss further on the next slide. Lastly, please note our estimates for D&A, interest expense, corporate items, and our new effective tax rate.","Slide 22 shows additional details on our $1.5 billion capital investment priorities for 2018. Approximately, $900 million will go toward maintenance and regulatory projects to maintain our safe and sustainable world-class mill system of low-cost advantage assets, ultimately keeping the lights on with added benefits of improved liability. Further, we will also invest $100 million in high-return cost-reduction projects where we have a healthy pipeline in our core businesses with IRRs of 30% or greater, which we will fund over time to optimize our advantage assets.","And lastly, we will invest $500 million in strategic projects with healthy spreads above our cost of capital. These include, for example, the Madrid Mill conversion from newsprint to lightweight recycled containerboard, where we'll see the benefit starting in the second half of the year. And a recently announced Riverdale machine 15 conversion from uncoated freesheet to virgin white top containerboard with a total capital investment of $300 million over 2018 and 2019. Again, we are taking this additional step to unbundle our capital expenditures to scale and emphasize the meaningful shift to value creation in our growth businesses.","And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, Glenn. We are very pleased with the progress we made in 2017 and, as I mentioned earlier, with the momentum we're carrying into 2018. We're confident in another year of 10% plus EBITDA growth, driven by continued strong outlook in our core businesses and the full year price flow-through of 2017 increases. We continue to see healthy demand and solid fundamentals across our portfolio. We're making great progress on our optimization initiatives, as we improve our world-class manufacturing system. We have great customers in all of the important segments in the businesses that are core to International Paper.","In addition to our EBITDA growth, we're also confident about our equity investment outlook. The Ilim JV is well positioned for another strong year performance. And we will start to see the benefits of our investments in Graphic Packaging. All in, we expect another year of strong cash generation. And we'll continue to allocate capital to grow value for our shareholders. And with that we'll open up the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lars Kjellberg with Credit Suisse.","Lars Kjellberg","Yes. Good morning. And thanks for all the details. I just wanted to have a couple of clarifications on the input cost. You talked about $0.60 for the full year 2017. Do you have any sense where you're going to get through 2018? And also, if you can comment a bit on fluff prices. There's, obviously, some degree of time lag. So should we not have expected a bigger positive from pricing and fluff in the first quarter?","Mark Sutton","Why don't we start with that first? And I'll turn that over to Jean-Michel.","Jean-Michel Ribieras","Good morning. Fluff prices, as you know, as always, I've mentioned, some time difference. And we actually [indiscernible] reason and also price increase for February. So we mostly expect to see the benefit of these price increases in Q2. We did announce this month a price increase in Q4. But it was only captured and officially reported this month. So again, I think some of the announcements we had in Q4 were not clearly taken. And because now they are officially, I think, we will see the benefits in Q2, but not in Q1 - or very small in Q1.","Lars Kjellberg","Okay.","Mark Sutton","So, Lars, can you repeat the question on input -","Lars Kjellberg","Yeah, you talked about a $0.60 hit, I guess, in one of the references you made in the presentation. Could you kind of - yeah. So how do you think input cost - what sort of impact do you see for the full year in 2018?","Mark Sutton","Well, in the full year in 2018, what we spoke to is $35 million across our businesses, driven by higher wood, energy, and transportation costs.","Lars Kjellberg","No, I appreciate that. But if you kind of look at a full-year basis, I suppose just the first quarter. Do you have any view on -","Mark Sutton","On a full-year basis, we're looking - go ahead, please. Glenn, would you want to refine that?","Glenn Landau","No, Lars. What we've outlined is the 35, we've outlined the first quarter. And we are continuing to refine as we look forward for the balance of the year.","Lars Kjellberg","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Just one clarification on the guidance. The 10% EBITDA growth and then a couple of price increase announcements in the last week or two and a number of new different product rates. Just wondering if that's contemplated in the guidance, or if you think you can get to that sort of an EBITDA growth level even before the impact of those price increase announcements, recognizing that even if they did happen, they will be impacting you more later in the year?","Glenn Landau","Yeah. I think our outlook is based on our exit rate performance and our initiatives. And we don't include any outlook of initiated increases in that number.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks for that. And just a question on the balance sheet. You're getting a little closer to your leverage targets. The pension looks like it's in pretty good shape. I think you've outlined before, not a lot of cash needs there. And you're obviously getting a fair amount of money - a benefit from the tax law change. Just wondering if you have any updated thoughts on uses of cash, going forward, so we see the dividend maybe move up in line with some of the - giving some of the cash tax benefits back to the shareholders. Any kind of priorities you've got for use of cash at this point?","Mark Sutton","Brian, this is Mark. That's a great question. And if you think about our capital allocation framework, we don't plan on changing that framework. It's a balanced framework with shareholder return through dividend and occasional share buyback, with balance sheet maintenance to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet, investment-grade, as Glenn mentioned in his remarks. And a certain amount of that cash we generate for strategic projects, small acquisitions, things that are creating value across the Company. So a tax saving flows more into free cash flow. That free cash flow goes through that balanced framework, just as it did before.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Just one last one for Glenn. Just on the cash tax rate. I think you mentioned you get some accelerated depreciation benefits. Any guidance on how that would compare to the book tax rate of 25% to 27%?","Glenn Landau","All in. So we factored all of the points I related to earlier into that new effective tax rate.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Landau","Good morning.","Mark Wilde","First, just coming back on that question Brian just asked. So what would the cash tax rate be, Glenn, in '18 and '19? Do you have any guidance on that?","Glenn Landau","Mark, we don't give guidance on the cash tax rate. But I underlined that we are a full taxpayer. The incremental savings due to the tax reform is around $200 million a year. And roughly, you can think about that as a third of our tax obligation.","Mark Wilde","Okay. I want to just step over to kind of capital spending in light of the - some of the tax law changes and also in light of a weaker dollar. And I'm just wondering whether these changes are going to affect your kind of capital spending cadence over the next few years, given the fact that you can accelerate the depreciation on new capital programs and also whether it's going to pivot IP back more towards a domestic focus?","Glenn Landau","Well, Mark, we have a balanced approach, as we speak too often, in terms of our capital allocation. Clearly, we've unbundled our strategic capital projects. And we've already oriented them to our core businesses of Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers, where most of those assets are in North America. So we were moving in that direction earlier. And it's accelerated depreciation and just helps us along those lines.","Mark Sutton","Yeah. And I would add that the cadence of capital is really driven by the opportunity to get returns and the demand signal we have for the businesses we are in. Where we spend it? Obviously, our regions compete on returns. So there could be an opportunity to do more cost reductions sooner, for example, in a US asset than somewhere else. But we're not going to spend more capital because of the depreciation change. It's going to change the economics of some of the capital we spend. But it will all be based on solid strong returns and a demand signal that says, our customers need better products or more products. And on the internal side, we've got lots of opportunity across the entirety of International Paper to get better on the cost and productivity side.","Mark Wilde","I guess, kind of following on that, Mark, then. In your biggest business, in the Industrial Packaging business, the box volumes have picked up pretty markedly over the last 18 months from what we had seen over the last several years. Is that a change in the demand signal in your view? Or is that just a cyclical element?","Mark Sutton","I think it's a change in the demand signal, if you look at the absolute growth of the box market. But you have to remember, converting capacity is very flexible. So with the system, the size, and the geographic scope of IP, we have had the capacity to address that in our box-making operations. Where you've seen us add some capacity starting with way back with the valiant restart is adding containerboard capacity to match more of the box demand we're seeing through all three of our channels.","Most importantly, our own box channel, where most of our containerboard goes. So that is true demand. And our box plants in certain regions are a lot busier. We've hired people. We've added shifts. We're creating jobs in areas where we have entire shifts of business that we didn't have before. So again, matching what our customers want with our core capabilities and doing it all in a profitable way is what drives all of these investment decisions.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then, lastly, just on - one of the capital elements is this Selma conversion, which I think you've talked about is $300 million. But according to some stuff in the trade press, you've talked about a $500 million investment in some local meetings down in Alabama. And I just wondered whether that's like money that you're spending in kind of preparation for the second machine conversion down there, or the trade press just has it wrong?","Glenn Landau","Ultimately, Mark, you just need to focus on the $300 million. That's what's associated with this project.","Timothy Nicholls","Yeah, I think, Mark - this is Tim. The other is normal maintenance and regulatory spending, which will be done in - over a long period of time. So we're going to try $300 million in specific for the project.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Fair enough. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Chris Manuel","Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions for you. And, I guess, to kind of come back to the cash tax component. I appreciate you're not necessarily given that guidance that way. But we're trying to, I guess, get a sense of the differential. So when we think of the $1.5 billion you're spending this year in '18 - and I think it's going to be a pretty chunky number next year - what portion would be US-based that we'd be able to accelerate the depreciation on? Or how would we think about that?","Glenn Landau","It's going to be the lion's share. You could count on $1.2 billion of the $1.5 billion on a run rate basis.","Chris Manuel","Okay. So in short, then we would expect, at least for the next year or two, that the cash tax rate probably is a little below book then? Would that make sense?","Glenn Landau","We're not going to forecast that. But the $1.2 billion will be the write-off on that capital.","Chris Manuel","Okay. Thank you. And then, my second question was, when we look at box - to Mark's question earlier - box has picked up a bit the last few years. But when we look at, particularly just even this last quarter, I think your volumes were modestly higher or still continuing to lag a bit. I get that at times, things happen to flow. But how would you have us think about on a go-forward basis that - I think most of us are kind of looking for box shipments with the economy getting better and with eCommerce and different components being 2% to 4%. How would we think about IP participating in that? Should be anticipate that you'll kind of be at industry rate? Should we anticipate maybe there's some leakage there? Or how would you have us think about it?","Timothy Nicholls","So, over - hi, this is Tim. Over time, we expect to be at market rate. And they do have been slow. And I think you saw in the second half of the year, we started picking up just through normal churn of business and customer wins. But we saw really strong demand right through the end of the year. And it's continuing in January.","Chris Manuel","Okay. And just a sense of what January is out for you?","Glenn Landau","Right - through January and their preliminary numbers, but we were up a little bit over 4% in January.","Chris Manuel","Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon","Yes, good morning. Just a couple questions. First, you mentioned that the fluff business or cellulose business would get a bigger part of the corporate allocation. Can you let me know how much per quarter roughly that will be in 2018 versus 2017?","Mark Sutton","Okay. Yeah, think about 30 million of new allocated for the full year.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And then on the pension. Just to be clear, you show that you got the ratio down to 3.3. Is it really a little below the 3 times around there, because I believe you didn't get the proceeds from the consumer sale till after the first of this year. So if you adjust for that, it's even lower or was it already adjusted?","Glenn Landau","it's already adjusted.","Chip Dillon","Okay. Got you. And then last thing Glenn, you mentioned that the unlimited tax payments that you have to make would total about $200 million over the next 8 years net of credits. Now, I guess it's fair to say you probably could use those credits at some other point and if that's true, sort of, what was the gross amount, was it closer to say $300 million or $400 million?","Glenn Landau","We haven't disclosed that - it's a meaningful number. But this is the net.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And then I guess the last thing is on the - in the fluff business, I think you - if you could just repeat what you said would be some of the changes going from the 4th to the first. I know was the inventory write-up, could you explain how that works. Is that a function of what pricing was doing. And is that something that could repeat in future years.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Repeat the question.","Chip Dillon","You remember the fluff you had inventory benefit in cellulose, I should say a $15 million from an inventory. I guess a positive or credit. And could you just let us know how that worked and if that would likely repeat?","Mark Sutton","Sure. Chip. Certainly that's something we measure over time and it's somewhat hard to forecast, but that's a one-time that's LIFO. It's a one-time event true up we do on annual basis in the 4th quarter.","Chip Dillon","Okay Got you. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","George Staphos","Hi, and good morning. Thanks for all the details. And congratulations on the progress in '17. I wanted to come back to the question on box volume. And I know you've made progress in this regard. But the 0.3% volume growth really is more, when we think about it, emblematic of the growth rates we were seeing prior to eCommerce hitting stride, whatever would have been, at least gaining critical mass, a year and a half ago. So is there something underlying in the business, Tim, that's caused the greater growth to be flatter, perhaps, than we would have expected, considering especially your strong weighting with some of the larger etailers that are out there?","Or was it very much as you had expected? And if it was as expected - part two of this question - IP, given its scale, given its size, given its position as number one, we probably would expect not initially lead the market every quarter. But it has generally trailed most of the publicly reported companies in terms of box growth over a number of periods. So when should we expect - should we expect that gap to ever close? Thanks. I had a couple of follow-ons.","Timothy Nicholls","Sure. Hey, George. Yeah. I mean, we did trail in '17. We performed in line '16. We had some customer turnover. We made some choices, started picking up business in the second half of the year. So it was in line with our expectation in what we thought we would do with our customer base. And I think it will continue ramping as we go through the first part of '18.","George Staphos","Okay. Fair enough. And you expect to be able to maintain more of an industry growth rate, recognizing - there are no guarantees in life. You need to monitor month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter. But from what you'd see right now, there is no reason why you shouldn't be at least trending with the industry over 2017. Would that be a fair assessment?","Timothy Nicholls","Yeah, I would put it this way. Our expectation is we will do it over time. I mean, we'll pick our spots in terms of how we look at margin. And we will make choices from time-to-time where we think we are making the right decision for maximizing sustainable margins.","George Staphos","Okay. That's fair. Thank you for going through that. I don't know if you can comment to this. But nonetheless, there's been some discussion in the trade press about International Paper being out with a containerboard price hike to customers. Can you comment as to whether you've been notifying customers in that regard, or where you stand in terms of any pricing action in containerboard in North America?","Timothy Nicholls","No, I really can't, George. We can't for our customers.","George Staphos","Okay. Fair enough. And, I guess, the last question I had to start - I mean, the bigger picture. Actually, two questions and then we'll turn it over. First, you mentioned - again I think within the box business that you've been pleased with your commercial performance over time. How do you measure your commercial performance? Is it just the timing of what you get the containerboard price into the market? Is it margin in boxes? I know you can't discuss too much live, Mike. But how do you evaluate your commercial performance and which is suggesting your view that you've been doing well in that regard?","And the bigger picture question is, going back a number of years ago, there was a much larger EBITDA target that the Company had been hoping for. And obviously, the markets and the Company's portfolio have changed such that maybe that's not we should ever be thinking about anyway. But what other things can IP do that would step-change directionally the EBITDA closer to that 5 number than where it's currently been and, obviously, been making progress? What would you have us think about? Is there an Analyst Day, perhaps, coming up where you might be able to talk to that? Thank you, guys. And good luck in the quarter.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, George. There was a lot wrapped up there. And let me try to go back to the first part and unbundle some of it. I think, at a macro level, we look at margins. We look at - not just on box, but how we think about all the channels that we operate in. And growth is a piece of that margin. Price is a piece of that margin structure, cost is also.","On a more granular level, it comes down to customer-by-customer and understanding our customers' needs, understanding where we can deliver value propositions that are meaningful to them. And we do that across our portfolio of customers. So we do it high level. And we do it right down to how do we execute with any specific customer.","Timothy Nicholls","George, I'll take the second part on the $5 billion that we shared back in 2012. You're right. The Company is a significantly different company than we were back then. And I think the way we get the EBITDA grow and it's put together years like we had in 2017 with double-digit EBITDA growth. And we think we'll do that again in '18. And positioning the Company to have high returns.","So our returns today, return on invested capital, for every bit where we said they would be at the $5 billion. What we haven't done is delivered. That's not the number to think about. The number to think about is growing International Paper from where we are and maintaining a solid spread in actual returns above our cost of capital and that's, we think, the best way to create long-term value.","So we position the Company to have our strongest business, get the most resources. And we position the company to have a growth profile. It's not a high-growth profile, but a growth profile with packaging and a growth profile with cellulose fibers. And I think if we put that together, we'll have more opportunity to create more value than even the Company that we just described in 2012.","George Staphos","Thanks for all the thoughts, guys.","'","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with DA Davidson.","Steve Chercover","Thank you. Good morning.","Glenn Landau","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Chercover","First of all, freight is becoming a hot topic again. And a few years ago when it was tight, the industry raised their inventories. And I'm just wondering if you could - and I'm not sure that you can - would you do so again?","Timothy Nicholls","Hey, David, it's Tim. Let me just speak to Industrial Packaging. What we're trying to do is make sure that we have the capability to service our customers when they need to be serviced. So fourth quarter was a lot of commotion - rail lines not running as effectively as we would have liked them to, knock-on effect between rail lines, knock-on effect to trucking, complications from structural issues in trucking itself. But we did, given our capability, service all of our customers. And so, we were able to sort through that. But for me, thinking about - it's not a level of inventory, it's the capability. And we produce thousands of SKUs for 15,000 to 20,000 customers. And making sure we have the right thing in the right place at the right time is how we go about managing our system.","Mark Sutton","Yeah. I think, Steve, I'll add on to Tim and speak for the rest of the Company beyond Industry Packaging. When we think about inventories, it's one of the choices we had in our value chain. And so, when everything is working great in transportation area, the velocity of the inventory is moving, the levels tends to be lower. If there are bottlenecks somewhere in the value chain, then that's a use of cash to have more inventory and spend less on emergency transportation.","The whole goal is to serve the customers' needs. And so, absolute inventory numbers are not certainly designed to velocity that inventory through the system and meeting customer expectations at profitable levels as what we designed to. And we have the supply chain systems in place, people. So we were organized what we've centralized, what we haven't, and the IT systems to underpin and to be able to do that.","Steve Chercover","Yeah. I appreciate that. Because it seems to me that people look at inventories in isolation, and it's just one factor to service customers and maximize profits. Thanks.","So then, one other question on - especially on cellulose. Pulp prices continue to go up. And the discount between list and mill net is starting to narrow. And was that part of the synergy capture that you mentioned?","Jean-Michel Ribieras","Hi, it's Jean-Michel speaking. We are maximizing our customer. It's exactly like in packaging. We're going to the best segments where our customers look at the long term, where they value the products we do, especially the big portfolio of products we do. We don't have one fluff specialty. We have niche products of fluff. So this is even more important actually than the 1%, 2% discount change or whatever. We have a lot of customers. Now, we actually sell net prices, don't have discounts anymore.","So the optimization is much more a capacity to answer our customer needs, both in terms of products and innovation. And when you look at our growth in sales - and let's thank our customer - because we have had record fourth quarter. We've had a very nice year in terms of growth. The market is continuing to have a very strong demand. And we are winning in this market. So I think this is clearly the main point.","And just to be clear, in the synergy, you don't have pricing. Pricing is not in the synergy. So what you do have is mix improvement, for example. Let me give you an example. [indiscernible] got no more capacity at warehouses. We had Riegelwood 18. Between the knowledge of our innovation center and the knowledge of International Paper, we're able to qualify Riegelwood much faster than we ever thought about it.","And Riegelwood 18 is a very big success in the market. And today, the machine is producing about 10% more than the initial investment. And the machine is fully qualified. And for this year, it's sold out. This is well ahead of what we had planned. And that's one of the synergy we've had of getting together. But not pricing. There is no pricing in synergy.","Steve Chercover","That's terrific. Okay. merci, Jean-Michel. And thank you, everyone.","Jean-Michel Ribieras","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. Mark, just - first one question was, how are you, treating the Consumer Packaging and Graphic when you're giving off the EBITDA guidance of 10% plus 2018 versus 2017?","Glenn Landau","Basically, it's excluding Consumer. Consumer is a discontinued operation. And our 10% plus is from the new base.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. So if I understood you correctly, you said that the - that EBITDA guidance included nothing for the containerboard anchor depreciate or pulp price initiatives that you also have underway. But that was just your exit. And so if I take 10% of your $3.7 billion, that's $370 million. And so, you just do the math of what that would be, and that's like $0.70 per share of accretion, all else equal. And then, additionally, we have that lower tax rate, which adds $0.25 from last year as well. And then, I guess, we'll have to factor in what we think will happen with Ilim and then whether Graphic\/Consumer does better or not. Is that an appropriate framework to think about how you see 2018 playing out using the exit from 2017?","Glenn Landau","Yeah. I think, in general, that's directionally correct. Certainly, any initiatives that have happened subsequent to the end of the year and not in the run rate are what we call the plus piece of that 10%.","Mark Sutton","I think, Mark, the other thing to think about is, you get all top line changes that are all positive. The way it will work out, we just don't know exactly how. If all of that happens that you just described, that probably means a really strong economic environment when that happens. Lots of things are unpredicted like where inputs go, transportation we talked about earlier. So there is sometimes a margin squeeze on that strong economic background, comes with activity as it is value chain. So that's why -","Glenn Landau","There's puts and takes.","Mark Weintraub","Yeah. No, I appreciate that. It's a very fair point. And, I guess, just the one thing that is - I don't want to say different than. But on the 1Q guidance, you're giving - you're certainly calling for a lower profitability than - at least where expectations, I believe, by my quick math on it - than where people might've been expecting. But again, your full year doesn't seem to be doing that at all. Maybe talk a little bit about - and it does certainly seem like you have a lot of maintenance in the first quarter. That certainly could be a part of this.","Glenn Landau","That's exactly it. I think we framed it as seasonally slow, heavy maintenance. And there are some non-repeats. The main message here is the full year that Mark underlined. And a new rate of 10% plus in this first quarter, as we've seen in the past, is timing. We feel good about the fundamentals in the first quarter.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Great. And then, very quickly, lastly. So the box shipment data came out this morning. And that showed average week up 0.4%, which - I was just curious what you had seen in December. It just seemed a little bit surprising, given there had been talk about how strong December in particular was, albeit against a relatively difficult comp. And - but for the full quarter, if you looked at the industry data, it wasn't actually that much ahead of yours. It's just like 1% on an average day basis. But again, a little bit antithetical to the notion that business is really good, which is what I'm hearing from everybody.","Timothy Nicholls","Yeah. Hey, Mark, it's Tim. Yeah, our fourth quarter felt very strong. We see the box market is strong in the fourth quarter. We see it continuing in the first. And you mentioned that it was a tough comp. And if memory serves, I think it was the toughest comp of any month in the year. I believe December of '16 was close to 6% daily. And so, it was a beat on that comp in December. So I see it as a very strong market.","Mark Weintraub","And can you share with us what your December - or your December specifically, what your comparison was?","Glenn Landau","I don't have it on top of my head. You saw the quarterly number. But December was strong for us, led by eCommerce again, which was over 20% for us. So, yeah, we had a very strong December.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. I've just got a couple of follow-up questions on cost. I think in the past you've talked about an manual labor inflation hurdle of $120 million to $230 million. Is that still a decent target for 2018? Or could you see something above that, given the tighter labor market in US?","And then, on the 1Q outlook, you quantified the impact from energy, wood, and transportation. Is it possible to carve out how much of that was transportation or basically freight?","Glenn Landau","Okay. Two questions. First one relative to inflation. I still think that's a good point that you mentioned relative to year-over-year inflation. We have contracts with employees. That's not going to change a lot in the near-term. The variability that we would see in other inflation would be more along the PPV lines. Relative to the guidance of $35 million of input headwinds, that's certainly wood, energy. But transportation is meaningful. It's certainly kicked in as the businesses have spoken to it, about constrained availability in the fourth quarter. We think that will continue in the first quarter and throughout the year. So I won't give you a percentage, just meaningful.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. Okay. And then, just switching to the 2018 outlook. One of the catalysts you identified was the Madrid startup. Can you remind us the timeline there? And then, more broadly, European Industrial Packaging, I think profit was negative in 4Q. As you look to 2018, what's kind of the timeline there for margin recovery and profitability in Europe?","Glenn Landau","Well, that's a good question, Anthony. And clearly, as we have laid out, the Madrid mill is a big piece of that margin recovery. That gives us the vertical integration we were looking for in the recycled segment. It's going be a low-cost first quartile mill. Candidly, as we have laid out the time-frame here, it has been delayed somewhat, mostly just due to engineering scoping. But we feel good about the ultimate outcome. And we should see those benefits in the second half of the year.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones","Hi. Just two quick ones for me. I just wanted to confirm on the annual purchase for key inputs slide that the delta between last quarter and this quarter is primarily due to removal of the Consumer business. Just some of the numbers seemed like a pretty big shift like caustic, for example. And then, is this something that we would use then for assumptions for 2018, just give us a 2017 on it?","Glenn Landau","So on the input slide in the appendix you're talking about, yes, those have all been adjusted for the removal of our discontinued operation of Consumer. And they would be good estimates for you.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thank you. And then, just - if you can just give us your updated comments on OCC. I didn't quite catch what rate you're assuming for your Q1 guidance. And just what you're seeing in the market right now in terms of what China is doing?","Timothy Nicholls","Hey, Debbie, it's Tim. Permits have been granted. It feels like it will be somewhat flattish in the early part of the quarter. And then the best view we have from on the ground in China is that things would start accelerating again after Chinese New Year. I think you also have to consider this is one of the lowest generation times of the year. So it's what China is doing, it's what's happening with generation. And then, transportation going to have an impact as well, just trying to move fiber from one place to another.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","I'll now turn the conference back to Guillermo for closing remarks.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Thanks, everyone, for taking time to join us this morning. As always, Michele and I will be available after the call. Our numbers are on slide 24 of the presentation. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jay Royalty, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jay Royalty","Thanks, Wanda, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are John Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, given our expanded disclosure around our Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John Faraci.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everybody. As we usually do, over the next 15 to 20 minutes, Carol Roberts and I will review our first quarter 2004 (sic) [2014] results and the performance of our individual businesses, then we'll speak to our outlook and we'll open it up to the Q&A session.","So let me just start off. International Paper delivered solid operating earnings despite the unusual combination of multiple severe weather events, particularly in the Midwest and Southeast, where a big portion of our mills, box plants and customers are concentrated. The earnings impact due to the weather, which fortunately is now behind us, was $60 million in the quarter.","Quarter-over-quarter, we also experienced, and this is the positive part, higher prices in many of our global businesses, including Printing Papers in North America, Consumer Packaging, Industrial Packaging in North America, as well as the Paper business in Latin America, particularly Brazil.","Despite the significant weather impact, we had strong results in our North American Industrial Packaging business, with operating earnings at record levels for the first quarter. We also successfully executed $120 million of mill outages at 13 mills and completed the Courtland closure, and our transitioning activities are progressing. We've entered the final stages of the Courtland closure but not all the costs are behind us but a big chunk of them are. We made a lot of progress on the xpedx spin\/merge with Unisource, and we expect to close that transaction around the middle of the year.","I'm also pleased to report that the Ilim Joint Venture had a solid quarter operationally, almost 2x, almost double the level of the fourth quarter, driven by the ramp-up of the projects, which involved higher volumes, improved productivity, better quality and lower costs. We also got some pulp price increases.","These gains, however, were masked by a negative $0.10 noncash charge associated with the devaluation of the ruble during the quarter against the joint venture's U.S. dollar denominated debt. I think the progress on the Ilim ramp-up just underscores International Paper's capability to operate and run global businesses that are in our core business space.","And finally, we continue to make progress with our share buyback program in the quarter, and I'll discuss those results a little later on the call.","So continuing with our financial results, EBITDA was $920 million for the quarter, down slightly from last year. But remember, weather was $60 million of that. We also had $40 million of cash costs associated with the Courtland closure.","Free cash flow was $254 million. But I think to really compare that to the first quarter of $300 million last year, you need to do 2 things: take the weather impact of $60 million, the $40 million cash costs for Courtland and the $60 million higher CapEx that we had in the first quarter that's planned, and our underlying free cash flow was closer to $380 million, but we showed $250 million here for those other 3 reasons.","So let me turn it over to Carol Roberts now to talk about the business performance.","Carol L. Roberts","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Looking at the sequential EPS bridge, IP earned $0.61 per share in the first quarter versus $0.83 in the fourth quarter. As you can see, on the bridge, the $60 million weather impact is on the far right. And as you think about that impact, it's about 50% operational disruption with higher costs associated with that, 25% lost volume and 25% higher input costs in the quarter.","Outside of the weather impact, as John mentioned, we experienced favorable pricing. We did see seasonally weaker volume, we had good operation, and the impact of the heavier maintenance outages hit us in this quarter. Additionally, we saw other increased input costs, a negative swing on corporate due to the non-repeat of the favorable item from the fourth quarter and the net unfavorable change in equity earnings at Ilim due to the noncash FX impact, as John described earlier.","I think it's important, turning to the next slide, to put a little context around our results for the first quarter of '14 versus the first quarter of '13.","When you compare our year-over-year results, the first quarter of '14 was a strong quarter, considering we had the impact of the weather, a higher tax rate and the unfavorable noncash Ilim FX impact of $0.08. And additionally, if you look into the ops line, $0.05 of the year-over-year impact was attributable to the Courtland shutdown cost. So when you put all that together, those items represent $0.32 per share headwind in the quarter year-over-year.","Turning to the next slide. This shows our quarter-over-quarter global input costs impact. As you can see, we experienced significant headwinds, largely driven by the extreme weather condition across much of the U.S. This drove energy costs much higher. And those costs, although seasonally improving, will remain relatively high as we work through the second quarter. We do anticipate that the gas market is going to [ph] albeit slowly due to the current pretty low level of gas inventories that exist right now.","We experienced seasonal wood cost increases as well. In addition to the weather impact, our wood costs are currently being unfavorably impacted by competition for fiber from OSB plant start-ups and some new export pallet facility. Although we do expect some improvement in North America wood costs throughout the year, we do expect the wood demand environment to remain under some pressure over the next couple of quarters.","Now turning to the businesses on Slide 10. Let me talk about Industrial Packaging. As John mentioned, the Industrial Packaging business had a strong quarter, driven by increased prices, favorable mix and stronger sequential volume in North America.","Our year-over-year box volume was down about 2% on a per day basis, and this is roughly in line with the industry. Outside of the weather impact, the operations performed well and the business successfully executed $69 million of outages. Wood and seasonally higher energy costs were partially offset by favorable OCC costs.","In addition to our planned maintenance outages, the business did take 60,000 tons of market-related downtime in the quarter, as we continue to match our supply with our customers' demand.","Looking at the EBITDA margins in North American Industrial Packaging on Slide 11. The business continues to generate the best margins in the industry, and Mark Sutton and his team are actively working initiatives across the business, which will drive further margin expansion over time.","Before leaving Industrial Packaging, I wanted to touch on what we're seeing on the demand front through April. As you can see on this slide, month-to-date, April '14 shipments are up about 3% from the first quarter level and, importantly, are up 2% versus April of '13. While this comparison only considers what we've seen so far this quarter, there's no doubt that demand has certainly picked up from the Q1 level and particularly has picked up from the March level. This is from the recovery -- from the weather, of course, but also as we move into a seasonally stronger time of year.","Moving on to Consumer Packaging on Slide 13. We exited the quarter with price momentum as we continue to implement our recently announced increases. I have to note for this quarter, volume was constrained by a 5-year coal mill outage in Augusta. We did see sequentially softer demand around Chinese New Year in our Sun JV, and we had a significant outage, a positive outage, at our coated paperboard machine at our Kwidzyn, Poland mill as we did a significant capital project to enhance our product quality.","Other significant factors impacting Brazil were escalating input costs, disruptions due to the severe weather and just consistency of our manufacturing operations.","In the other category, which shows up on the bridge, that's primarily FX and driven by the weakening currency in China.","I think it's important for our Consumer Packaging business to highlight a lot of the positive momentum that may be masked in the previous bridge. That's going to result in the business having improved earnings in the second half of the year and beyond.","It's important to note that 85% of our mill outages in the U.S. business will take place in the first 5 months of the year. We know that North American SBS backlogs remain strong at 5 weeks, and we anticipate that will continue given the high outage schedule that I just mentioned.","We saw record cup demand in the Q1 despite January and February's weather in much of the U.S. And we expect full realization of the announced price increases in both our Coated Paperboard and Foodservice grade in this business.","Real good news is we're continuing to see the positive momentum in the shift from foam to paper cups, and that's going to benefit both our Coated Paperboard and Foodservice businesses. To ensure that we have the capacity to take advantage of this growing demand, we recently announced the expansion of our Kenton, Ohio facility, which we will complete by mid-next year.","And finally, which is very exciting, is we recently very successfully completed a significant capital project to our Bleached Board machine in Kwidzyn, Poland, and we will realize the benefits from enhanced product quality and expanded margin, as we ramp up and bring this new product to market over the next year.","On Slide 15, let me move on to Printing Papers. In Printing Papers, we saw price improvement in North America and Brazil, along with mix improvement as we exited lower-price positions as part of the Courtland transition. But these were more than offset by lower volumes in North America, Brazil and Europe. The North American volumes were lower, of course, due to the Courtland shutdown. And for Brazil, the first quarter is just a seasonally slower quarter. I'd want to note that volume and mix were adversely impacted by a slowing Russian economy. And consequently there, we saw an increase in our export shipment. We do expect this trend to continue into the second quarter. The higher costs that show up on the bridge are essentially result of the Courtland shutdown. Higher inputs, namely wood and energy, unfavorable FX in Brazil and weather, were also negative to the quarter.","We realized $36 per ton in price improvement across all the grades in North American paper, and that's slightly ahead of expectations on a weighted average basis as that first price increase was applied to about 75% to 80% of our mix.","Turning specifically to an update on the Courtland shutdown on Slide 16. Things are progressing well, and we're entering the final stages of the shutdown and transition.","All production was ceased in the first quarter, and we're currently depleting all the transition inventory. Really important work on the qualification trials for the retained business is nearing completion.","I want to take a moment on behalf of the entire senior leadership team at the company to thank all our colleagues at the Courtland mill and across the North American Printing Papers business who've been involved with this really massive undertaking for a tough job that was done very well.","I'm happy to report that a significant number of our Courtland colleagues have found employment opportunities. Many of which were in other International Paper facilities, where we had openings and opportunities.","As we've talked about over the last couple of quarters, we are incurring closure and transition costs as part of this initiative. The impact on operating results in the first quarter was close to $30 million. We expect costs in the second quarter to be about half that, and then there will be some residual and transition costs that flow into the third and fourth quarters, and they'll be in the range of about $5 million to $10 million per quarter.","Moving on to distribution. Distribution did experience a challenging quarter as supply chain disruption due to the weather challenges certainly impacted operations and revenue. Lower costs did help our margin, but these benefits were more than offset by the weaker sales. And as John mentioned, we're making very good progress with the activities related to completing the spin\/merge transaction with Unisource.","Moving on to the Ilim Joint Venture. As John mentioned, the Ilim Joint Venture had a very solid quarter of progress, with $115 million of operational EBITDA, and that improvement was driven by better operations, better productivity, which led to higher volume, and increased pulp prices.","On IP's equity earnings though, we were negatively impacted by the weakening ruble during the quarter and the resulting noncash FX impact on the JV's U.S. denominated debt. The JV saw its operational EBITDA, as John said, increase by $54 million in the first quarter, and that just shows the very significant progress we're making on the ramp-up of our projects.","While the JV expect operational performance to continue to improve, we have seen some decline in pulp prices from first quarter levels, and that will modestly impact second quarter results unfavorably. And while the Russian economy has slowed considerably, that will impact our Paper business to the West. It is important to note that all of -- much of our production, a majority of our production in the East is destined for China, and the China pulp demand for this business remains strong.","Turning to Slide 19. I wanted to take a moment to give you an update on the 2 significant capital projects at the Ilim JV. On the left is the Bratsk mill and on the right is the Koryazhma mill that houses PM-7 that we've started up. The bar graphs represent the recent production ramp-up trends for each.","So if I look at Bratsk, you can see that production continues to ramp up. And to put a number on this, we're showing that representing 30% increase in output from the fourth quarter of '13 to our outlook for the second quarter of '14. And the JV expects to achieve full production targets on the new fiber line by year end.","In the case of the paper machine at Koryazhma, the machine actually achieved full production and qualification on our uncoated freesheet grades in March. So great progress at the JV and more to come as the year unfolds.","So before turning it back to John, let me move to Slide 20 and give you an outlook into the second quarter. I want to note that at the bottom, we added a line on the chart to account for the first quarter weather impact, which is $60 million across our North American business. And remember, this includes some volume, the operational impacts and the input costs escalation that occurred in the first quarter.","Outside of that broad weather impact, which included the items I just mentioned, we expect volume to increase in North American Industrial Packaging by an incremental 1.5% to 2.5%. Volume should also modestly improve the North American Consumer Packaging and in Brazil packaging.","Given the economic slowdown in Russia, we do expect some modest unfavorable volume and price\/mix impacts for the Paper business in that part of the world.","Paper pricing\/mix will continue to improve in North America and to some extent in Brazil. We should also see the benefit of higher pricing in fluff pulp. We will see some favorable pricing in North American Consumer Packaging as we implement our announced price increase. With the increase in volume in North American Industrial Packaging that comes from a ramp-up of some of the consumer packaged goods companies, we could and will likely see some modest offset as our customer mix normalize. And we do expect to see improvement in prices in our Brazil Packaging business.","Operations should continue to perform solidly, and we'll see the benefit of lower shutdown costs at Courtland, as I mentioned earlier. Outside of the weather, we expect overall input costs to be relatively stable with some puts and takes, with some pressure on wood prices, a slight headwind in our European business.","The second quarter is our heaviest maintenance outage quarter, with outage costs up $60 million versus the first quarter.","And finally, on the Ilim JV, we expect solid operational performance to continue. However, pulp prices are -- declined slightly from the first quarter, and we do have some planned maintenance outage in the quarter. As always, for the purposes of this exercise, we're assuming no change in FX, so a non-recurrence of that impact that we saw in the first quarter is planned for the second.","So with that as an outlook for the second quarter, John, let me turn it back to you.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Carol, and I'm on, I believe, Slide 21. Let me just summarize the major puts and takes as we move to the second quarter. Severe weather is behind us, and we've moved on. We see in April increased volume, particularly in our Industrial Packaging business. We think that's both seasonal improvement but also related to some economic activity, which is a good sign. Price realization in boxes is solid and with year-over-year sequential box volume up. We've got a number of pricing initiatives underway in coated paperboard, fluff pulp, North American paper, and we expect to see those benefits in the second quarter, balance of the year. The Courtland shutdown, as both Carol and I talked about, is nearly complete and the costs will be coming down, but we still got some costs with us.","We're going to experience our heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year, up $60 million from Q1. Our tax rate should be up from first quarter levels to roughly 32% for the year, assuming no major changes. But if extenders get passed, that will be lower. Interest expense benefit we had in the first quarter won't repeat. But all-in, we expect a stronger earnings quarter ahead of this Q2.","Let me shift gears here for a minute to step back and comment about what IP is doing with our cash. Previously, we talked about IP as a cash flow story. We're running our businesses well, generating higher levels of sustainable free cash flow. We're consistently generating returns for the company above our cost of capital. We work hard to strengthen the balance sheet. We've got $2.5 billion of debt since early 2012, and we met our leverage targets.","We've returned more cash to shareholders, increasing the dividend in each of the last 2 fourth quarters, as you see here on this slide. And we've been executing our share buyback authorization since initiating that last September. Simply put, we've done what we said we would do.","In terms of the dividend, you can see the recent history where we've made meaningful increases over the last couple of years. We've increased the dividend by more than 33% since outlining our plan in mid-2012, moving the dividend from $1.05 per share to $1.20 in the fourth quarter 2012, then to a $1.40 in the fourth quarter 2013.","Very clear, we're saying we think there's more dividend runway ahead, and we continue to increase dividend as free cash flow grows, periodically, systematically, thoughtfully, and importantly, sustainably.","Our target of 30% to 40% in free cash flow reflects really a trough-tested analysis of -- that we did because we intend, whatever level we get the dividend to, to make it sustainable. And that 30% to 40% of our free cash flow, which we outlined to many of you at Investor Day a couple of years ago really has dividend potential to grow the dividend to $1.60 to $2 a share.","A quick update on the share buyback program. We've continued to be in the marketplace. Since our fourth quarter call, we've purchased over $460 million of stock since our call on February 4 at an average price of roughly $46. This brings total authorization -- total purchases within our $1.5 billion authorization to nearly $1 billion in less than 8 months. And as I said before, with this authorization, we continue to take advantage of the opportunity to buy back larger amounts of stock when the price is attractive relative to our view of intrinsic value.","So let me just wrap up by concluding, what makes IP different. I'm not going to read this final slide here, but I think it highlights what IP does that does make IP different and enables us to generate strong free cash flow in today's economic environment, and at the same time, earn above cost of capital returns.","The economy is improving, albeit slowly, and that's going to help everybody. But the good news for International Paper and our shareowners is that we have plenty of things to work on that will provide upside from where we sit today, both in North America and in key markets around the globe.","So with that, I'd be happy to take your questions. Open it up right now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It's good to see volumes in containerboard bounce back in April. What are you expecting for volume growth for the balance of the year?","John V. Faraci","In containerboard?","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's right, in containerboard.","John V. Faraci","Mark, do you want to take that?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Sure. Philip, we started this year thinking we'll be looking at about a 1% demand environment in box, and that's just using our analysis around nondurable goods production. Of course, the first quarter didn't start out that way. But with a more normal trend of economic activity, that's still a number, we think, is achievable for the balance of the year, but it will all depend, really, and all driven by production in non-durable goods in the U.S. But April is only 1 month in the quarter, but we are seeing some underlying positive trends in customers and segments that really took a beating in the first quarter.","John V. Faraci","When I saw the GDP numbers that came out this morning for the first quarter, I wasn't surprised by what our box demand was. We were down 2 and GDP was basically flat.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then based on your demand outlook, how do you feel about inventory? And do you guys need to take any economic downtime going forward?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Well, we don't forecast the economic downtime given the cycle of the business, but our inventories are in pretty good shape. You noticed this is one of the first first quarters in the last couple of years that we weren't talking about a lot of supply chain costs and disruptions in the first quarter, largely related to our inventory position. So we feel good about our inventories. We're going to, obviously, make the containerboard we need to serve the 3 channels that we're in: our Box business that IP owns and runs first and then our domestic open market and exports. So I think we'll balance what we need in production. We've got a large, flexible system, and I think lack of supply chain issues indicate we've got a pretty healthy quantity of inventory, and the quality of our inventory is in good shape.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. And just let me sneak one more in for Carol. The potential dividend target you guys outlined, how quickly can we get to that midpoint? Is that a 2014 event? Is that more of a '14 or 2015 event?","Carol L. Roberts","Philip, we've said that as we watch the free cash flow of the company improve and we watch the business results come in, we'll evaluate it. I would say that you've seen us raise it in the fourth quarter of '12 and the fourth quarter of '13. So that's been the fact pattern so far.","John V. Faraci","Think incremental and periodic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","One on OCC. John, obviously many people have talked about their expectation that OCC prices would -- are biased upward over the long-term. But obviously, that hasn't happened over the past couple of years. Has there been anything over the past couple of years that you consider anomalous, such that OCC should go up from here? And how much depends on China?","John V. Faraci","Well, a lot depends on China. And at the end of the day, China on the pulp side, China is 100% of the world's incremental demand. And you could make an argument, it's probably pretty close to that in terms of incremental OCC demand. There's no question, China is going to elect more of their own OCC because their domestic box -- their box business to domestic market is growing as opposed to box business for export. But remember, China is close to a $50 million ton market. So if it's growing at 4% a year, that's 2 million tons a year, and China is fiber short. So it's almost -- it's hard to come to a conclusion. OCC prices don't trend up over time, with the biggest box market in the world being basically fiber short and recycled linerboard driven.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just one on the additional capacity in containerboard. How would you characterize the impact so far of the converted newsprint machines and of the new mills? And what do you expect the impact to be of the capacity that's been announced that has yet to hit the market but will do so later this year and into next year?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Adam, this is Mark Sutton. On the new capacity that's actually running, our view is the products that are being made are not all the same. They have different end uses. And in our own experience, given we're largely integrated and we export twice as much containerboard as we sell domestically, the impact directly to us has been pretty minimal. However, I think there are secondary impacts in the export market. If our market grows, as we expect it to, modestly, there should be a market to support some capacity additions. It's hard to tell how that's going to play out in the future given the range of quality that -- and capability of these products, but we're keeping an eye on it. It's hard, real hard to speculate on capacity that's being talked about but not yet here. So we're just monitoring that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of quickies. First of all, on Ilim, just to try and calibrate the model, absent the FX hit, should we see kind of low double-digit contribution, perhaps even low teens in the first quarter?","John V. Faraci","In terms of EPS?","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Yes. Well, in terms of the line item swinging from, I think, a loss of $31 million back towards $10 million to $15 million positive?","Carol L. Roberts","I think the way to look at that would be to take the FX out and that operational EBITDA that we mentioned of the $115 million. While we see good momentum on the production of the 2 projects in the mills, we see a little pressure on pulp pricing. And we have an outage that we'll take at the end of the quarter. So I would expect that we would see operational EBITDA to be down a bit from that first quarter level.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I recognized that the sanctions are against individuals in Russia as opposed to corporations. Are you concerned? Or do you have any contingency plans if things get worse?","John V. Faraci","Well, at this point in time, Steve, business conditions aren't worse as it relates to what's going on in the Ukraine. Actually, the weakening ruble is helping us in our competitive position because we have so much pulp we export to China. And as paper -- the Russian economy was slowing going into the fourth quarter. There's no question, it slowed a little more because of what's going on in Eastern Europe and in the Ukraine but the weaker ruble is also helping us on our paper exports because of the ramp-up of that paper machine in Ilim combined with the paper machine we have in IP Russia. We're exporting more paper out of Russia, and the market and the currency is helping us. We've got contingency plans. We've taken on quite a bit of debt to fund those products, but not all of that is long-term debt, and we have good contingency plans in place to roll over that debt regardless of what happens in the financial market. So like every other business, we're watching the situation closely. And with people on the ground over there, we're getting input from people on the ground as to what's happening and also kind of following the news here.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Great. And just on the containerboard inventories, every company seems to be comfortable with their levels. Yet collectively, they seem kind of high. Should we recalibrate our concern threshold?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Well, I think that's possible. I think when you look at the way that you can really leverage a well-run supply chain in these containerboard systems, and I only know ours. Managing to some arbitrary numbered inventory can actually cost you a lot more money. So I think that's something we are looking at, what's the best inventory for what we need. And then again, I've mentioned this before, not only is our demand seasonal, but our capacity is seasonal, largely through our maintenance outages. So that's not exactly the same every year. So we've got to prepare through inventories to get through maintenance outages.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the last call, I think you guided to 10% improvement and full year EBITDA and free cash flow of roughly $2 billion. And apologies if I missed this, but is that still intact given the weather hit that you experienced in 1Q? Or are there kind of big moving pieces that impact that guidance as we're 1 quarter through the year?","John V. Faraci","Well, we said approximately -- we said a significant improvement in EBITDA, approximately 10%. There's no question we're starting off with a $60 million hole. But we still see the year's shaping up with strong free cash flow and a meaningful improvement in EBITDA. And we've got some tailwinds we can create and I think if we continue to see the April box data as beginning of a trend, that's a positive sign. So we've got no reason at this point to change what we said on that last call.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting gears to Brazil. In the quarter, you increased your stake in Orsa and market conditions in Brazil have been a little bit soft. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the progress that you've seen internally at Orsa, the expected growth in margins that you hope to achieve in 2014, 2015 and just generally the market conditions there. There's been some talk about maybe power rationing, is that something that potentially could impact you or your customers? Or any thoughts you have there?","Timothy S. Nicholls","It's Tim. Well, just -- let's start with the last piece on energy. Energy costs are up, primarily because the -- Brazil, the whole country, is living through, for the industrialized parts, pretty significant drought at the moment. So we're taking steps to mitigate any risk we might have around operational performance both on the paper side and the packaging side. But we don't know what the weather is going to do, so it's kind of a week-by-week situation. In terms of Orsa, we had a disappointing quarter. Volume was lighter than we expected it to be. The good news is it was isolated around a handful of customers that are experiencing their own challenges in the market. We've taken steps and are taking steps to replace that volume. And we saw a continuation of OCC going up. So margins are not where we want it to be in the first quarter, which includes December through the February period because we report on a 1-month lag. The good news is that's the seasonally weakest quarter of the year, and we're expecting a significant improvement in results as we go into the second quarter. So we don't forecast earnings. But I've stated before, we think we can get the business into the mid-20s for EBITDA margins, and I still think that's true.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on North American paper price realizations. I think, Carol, you mentioned $36 a ton on your commentary. I'm just taking a look at Slide 43 in your deck, and there's a $56 a ton quarter-over-quarter change. Just wondering which ones -- which one is which. Or is there a difference between the 2.","Timothy S. Nicholls","It's Tim again. Actually, they're both correct. On the slide that you're looking at, we did average to average realize $56 a ton. We think about $20 of that was mix. And so when we look at the first price increase across all of our tonnage, you have to keep in mind that the announced price increase from the fall was only about -- on about 75% to 80% of our volume. And we think we've got a fairly normal realization on that. So it was $36 average to average. We actually exited the quarter $3 or $4 above that. So we felt pretty good about how we wrapped up the first price increase.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So essentially, that $36 of the first price increase and then the extra $20 comes from your mix?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Right. We've got $36 average to average. We actually exited in the quarter $3 to $4 above that. So probably $39, $40 a ton across all the tons.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just over on Bratsk. I mean, I like the 30% improvement from Q4 to forecasted Q2 '14. But what's the current operating rate? Or what was the operating rate for Bratsk in Q1 of '14?","John V. Faraci","We came out on the new pulp line at about 1,400 tons a day, which is about 70% of capacity. And the -- Carol talked about the outage we have coming into second quarter -- late second quarter will enable us to take the next big step and get that closer to design levels, as we go into third and fourth quarters.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","What's the current bottleneck at that mill?","John V. Faraci","Pardon me?","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","What's the current bottleneck or where is the...","John V. Faraci","We've got a couple of cases to make on equipment. There's no major bottleneck, like with any biggest softwood pulp line in the world, biggest continuous digester and we've got to go and do some not significant modification, the vendor is going to do for us. Don't worry about the Bratsk because we can sell all we can make.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, in the U.S. Containerboard business in the first quarter, your volumes were down 2%, the industry was flat, if I'm comparing apples-to-apples. And I think we had talked about in previous quarters that your volume should be more consistent with the industry numbers going forward. So maybe just for the first quarter, can you talk about what was different for you versus the industry? And then going forward, how do you see your performance versus the industry in the volume side?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Alex, this is Mark. The industry was actually down about 1.6%. We were down 2%. So we were roughly in line with the industry on a comparable basis. And we still believe, and we stated this before, we should and we plan to try to grow with the market. That's the type of customers we have, the segments we participate in with a broad-based business. And our expectation is, over the long term, to grow at the market rate. And we were relatively close to that in the first quarter. We've narrowed the gap. From about 1.5 year ago, we were as much as 300 to 400 basis points behind the market. We talked about why and we've consistently narrowed that gap to the point where we're very close now.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So my mistake, the 2% was on a per day basis, that absolute. Okay, that clears it up. And then on the optimization in containerboard in the U.S., we talked about previously, I think, a potential $100 million per year over the next couple of years. Can you just update us how you guys perform in the first quarter? I'm assuming it was probably challenging given the weather. And sort of how do you see yourself being able to perform relative to the $100 million target as we move through 2014?","Mark Stephan Sutton","We -- you're right, it was challenging in the first quarter. A lot of the optimization items we've highlighted are internal improvements, not really market improvements. And that is in supply chain and how we run our manufacturing operations. There's a couple areas I'd point to. John mentioned one of them, I think, earlier. In our converting facilities, in our Box business, we ran very well. We not only had a record first quarter in earnings but we had a best-ever performance in waste, the performance in our converting operations. And our supply chain across a number of metrics, how we use transportation, how we spend money, moving our product from our mills to our box plants, making sure we're making product in the right mill for the right end location, all improved in the quarter. So I think we made a good step. Obviously, the interruptions in the first part of the quarter made it more difficult.","John V. Faraci","I think the optimization is we're driving a racecar on the track, and the more laps we get around the track, the better the racecar gets. And that's really what optimizing the business is all about. It's a brand-new business for us, 3x the size it was 5 years ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to dig into your comments a little bit on the April containerboard volumes. You mentioned some pickup in underlying customers and end markets. Can you talk about a little bit more specifically what types of customers are we talking about? And which end markets you're seeing recovery in?","Mark Stephan Sutton","I would say, in general, given the month is just ending today, I think 2 things, I would say. In customers, it's broad based, but it's mostly in the customers that were most impacted in the first quarter. So you would think about the large consumer packaged goods companies that took maybe a disproportionate hit based on the type of products they sell and where they're located. And then I would say, geographically, we're seeing a broad-based improvement from March, especially. No single place. A lot of what we're seeing is with existing customers. Obviously, you don't win business in a 30-day period, necessarily. So a lot of it is with existing customers that we were off with in the first quarter, and we're regaining with those customers. But I would say across the board, segment and geography.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then within Industrial Packaging, you noted on Slide 38 that European container was actually up 2% year-over-year. Looks pretty strong to me. But how is that versus your expectations? Are you seeing some acceleration in the economy over there? What is sort of the underlying trends there?","John V. Faraci","Think of our European Box business having 2 pieces. There's Turkey and Morocco. Both countries are -- had good volume growth. Morocco was the strongest country in the European Box portfolio last year, principally driven by fruit and vegetable exports to Europe. And then we get to, France, Italy, Spain business. And frankly, volumes, and I think consistent with Western Europe coming out of a slump later than the U.S. did, is starting to -- I wouldn't say is sharply growing, but it's coming back to life. And so we're seeing some better box activity, particularly in the industrial segments. And so our box volume was up 4% quarter-over-quarter. We expect it to have a rebound year-over-year, and good news is we're seeing that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Just, I guess, question for Tim on just the Uncoated Freesheet business, how -- in North America, how you're feeling about the second price hike at this juncture. And any concern with some of the import -- additional import activity at Staples at this point?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Well, to be honest, we've lost a little bit of position due to imports on cut size. We'll see how long that holds up. There's a few things you need to know about imports, at least the way we think about it. First, they fluctuate dramatically over various periods of time and it's really driven by FX and by supply chain logistics costs. There's a pretty long pipeline to supply from 1 region of the world to another and not without disruption. But the other thing on imports, even though we've seen significant growth coming into North America in the first quarter, our belief is not all of that is staying in North America. Because of the way the reporting is done, we see it coming in. You don't see it going back out. And we believe that a portion of what's come in has come in for the purpose of redistribution back out to Central and South America. So we don't think it's to the degree that the reported numbers state. In terms of the business going forward, it's difficult to predict demand. But first quarter was no doubt soft, especially in the January time frame, and we think in part due to weather. So the good news was that it improved all the way through the quarter, and we exited March from a demand standpoint to a better place than we started for sure, and April looks okay so far.","John V. Faraci","With Mark on the work, we're not using a lot of copy [ph] paper.","Mark Stephan Sutton","No.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And I think the volumes you indicated were down, I think, 19% overall. Can you give us a sense or flavor sort of how that parsed out domestically versus exports? I imagine export was significantly a big driver of that. And then in addition, I know part of the strategy with Courtland was to improve the mix, and sort of where you are on that. You mentioned the transitional costs there. But are we still very early in the process for mix improvement in that business that we should see improvement in the coming quarters as well?","Timothy S. Nicholls","As we talked about just a minute ago, we realized $56 per ton of average price realization and incremental increase in price quarter-to-quarter. And about $20 of that, we think, was mix. So it's not a precise science, but we think that's a good number. What was the other part of your question? I'm sorry.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","I was just wondering if that -- if there's additional mix improvement that we should see beyond just what we saw in the first quarter?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Well, some of the mix improvement would be driven by seasonality. So there could be some, especially as we get into the stronger season of Q2 and in latter summer and the first part of the fourth quarter. The August, September, October time frame is generally a strong seasonal period as well. And some of the cut size promotions that we have run around either tax season or back-to-school. So I'd say what you should take away from it is, we feel like we're on track to the mix improvement that we wanted to get.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe going back to OCC question, given that it's driven by China, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your Chinese Box business? And also, I guess, as someone who buys a fair amount of board in China, when you look at the quality of the board you're buying, do you have any sense if there's been a change in the mix of where OCC in China is coming from, more domestic, et cetera?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Gail, it's Tom Kadien. I guess, to the latter part, we buy probably a dozen different grades of different kinds of test liner. So we wouldn't see a change in the quality of what we're buying based on, I'll call it, the mix of domestic versus imported OCC. Now that said, the Chinese -- our view on it, the box demand was flat to down. Export kind of oriented Box business in China is off. If you look at the Chinese economic data, exports were down double digits in February. They were down high single digits in March. So the export-oriented Box business is down. Domestic is growing. But not fast enough to make up for the export. So it's a pretty soft market. Chinese New Year was pretty slow coming out of that, and the first quarter box demand was certainly not what we'd hope for. Now we have seen an improvement, I would say, in the month of April.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just, again, international box. Last quarter, you talked about perhaps a bit of a struggle to pass through price increases on board into box. With some of the recycle prices in Europe falling over, has that become kind of a nonevent and not even a question at this point? Or are you still expecting to get some box price improvement over there?","John V. Faraci","Well, there's been some slippage in board prices, and that's helping us on our, we call, delta P. But it's still very competitive market in the marketplace for boxes. So we haven't gotten a much price lift at all, but we are getting some relief on the buy side because we're a net buyer of all of our board over there. And some of it does come from the U.S. on the virgin side.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And if I can maybe just throw in one last quick one, staying on international boxes, just the overall export market for your U.S. board.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Gail, the U.S. board that we export, I would say that I characterize the market on volume as stable. And we are not seeing any significant changes in the demand pattern in the major markets that we serve, including the board that goes through our own IP box plants.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And pricing?","John V. Faraci","Pricing, I'd say, is also stable. It will show in the data chart down quarter-over-quarter, but that's partly because of the way we entered the fourth quarter. But we've seen some recovery in isolated markets. But overall, I'd say it's a stable environment for the board we export, which is kraft linerboard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Looking at the uncoated freesheet situation. I know in the past, sometimes when we see a price increase announced, we wouldn't actually see the full amount, maybe it was sort of some customers will pay the full amount, but some might not. And as we think about the second round of increases of $50 to $70, could you just clarify what percentage of your mix in North America or the U.S. is subject to that? And is it your intention to pretty much show the full amount eventually, I guess, by the third or fourth quarter?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Chip, it's Tim. It affects roughly 85% -- depending on how mix plays out, 85% to 90% of our volume. What I would say about the second increase, we've had all of the conversations for the most part that we need to have with customers and we've settled all of those discussions. So what you're going to see is price increase will play out through the second quarter. And there's probably going to be a little bit that bleeds over to the first part of the third. But I think we don't forecast price, so -- but that's how I see it playing out.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then as we -- shifting gears a little bit, when we look at sort of the containerboard market in North America -- well, the Box business, I'm sorry, in April, you mentioned that was up year-over-year after being down in the first quarter. And one of your competitors was sort of suggesting it might not be up for them. Do you think some of what you're seeing is share gain? Or maybe asked differently, could it also involve maybe some catch-up with the first quarter issues? Or do you think there might be something more underlying going on in the marketplace?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Chip, this is Mark. What I'd mentioned earlier is what we're seeing mainly in our business is rebounding with existing customers. In that short of a period of time, not a whole lot of business changes hands in terms of share. So it's really -- I think part of it a snapback and part of it underlying economic improvement. But the majority of what we see is in our existing customer base.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Question on use of capital. In particular, given the last 5 or 6 years, it seems a lot of evidence, there's reduced volatility in your cash flows, much more stability. Does that incline you potentially to move to the top end of that 30% to 40% return through dividend range?","Carol L. Roberts","No. I think, Mark, that's an excellent point. We do view that our business is definitely less cyclical. And I think that view that it's less cyclical is also what's driven to the stable cash flows, the stable cash flows then lead to the dividend view of 30% to 40%. So I think they're all tied together. And I think, certainly, we feel that cash flow is sustainable and we feel that those targets are appropriate, and we'll just keep monitoring and pushing it. And I think John laid out a pretty clear number of that $1.60 to $2.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then on the same topic, you noted in the Slide 25, John spoke to, under the global -- it says leveraging global platform for profitable growth. And John, you also made an allusion to Ilim working out pretty well here and increased confidence in your ability to make core businesses successful overseas. Is that signaling a little increase in desire to seek out global growth? Or is it more kind of a reference to Orsa, the acquisition there? I'm just trying to read what -- whether there's a little bit of enhanced conviction on growing overseas or not?","John V. Faraci","Don't read anything into it, Mark, other than we're doing what we said we would do. And we spent $1.5 billion in Russia on big capital projects, not in our balance sheet, but on the Ilim balance sheet. And we're starting to deliver the results. I mean, we've gone through -- those projects are very complicated, very difficult, took longer than we thought. And we're going to start to see the benefits from those come through. And we'll get the same thing on Orsa. Tim said, we're a little bit behind there. But if we know anything, it's not around Industrial Packaging business, just about anywhere, and we'll get it right in Brazil.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I know we're late here. Two things: One on North America and then the other one on Orsa for Tim. In North American Industrial Packaging, if you look at the controllable factors, obviously the weather had an effect in your ability to analyze this. Where do you ultimately think you did better? Because from our vantage point, you had a very solid quarter versus our model. It sounded like it came more from converting relative to the mills. But could you confirm that? The related question, good managements that had a lot of experience in their businesses know how to adapt given market conditions. Certainly, you had a big curveball in terms of the weather. Were there any levers that you pulled in the first quarter that might have been pulled more in the second quarter from the optimization standpoint that means that sequentially or later in the year, you don't have quite the same pickup? And then a question for Tim, on Orsa, recognizing that you are confident in your ability to improve the margin to your target goal, what gives you the most conviction in getting that goal, Tim, in the next couple of years?","Mark Stephan Sutton","George, on the first part for North American Industrial Packaging, I think the way -- you're right, it's hard to analyze the quarter in terms of what went well or better than -- I'm not sure what was in the model, what went better than you might have expected. But your comment about converting, we definitely ran our Converting business very well, and we expected to as we've been optimizing and moving business around, and it's bearing fruit and on a number of fronts. On the cost side, on the service to customers, in both cases. And I think other than the early start to the quarter, where we did have some couple of our mills got into some freeze issues, we ran very well in our mill system, which is a big part of our optimization plan. It only takes a couple of our large mills to have a problem to kind of show you a poor average. But on a 17 mills or 16 mills in the U.S., we ran very well at most of them. So I think it was across mills and converting. As far as the levers on optimization, I wouldn't say we pulled anything in the first quarter that we took from another quarter. It was a lot of blocking and tackling and executing in the supply chain and how we run our mills from a reliability standpoint and in the choices we made relative to some of the action in response to what was happening on demand. And we took some economic downtime, and partly because of that demand environment not being where we thought it was. And we have a pretty sophisticated model of how to do that and do it at the lowest marginal cost. And we're getting better at that each quarter. And we're not done. We're still improving that process.","Timothy S. Nicholls","George, it's Tim. Just on Orsa around the conviction on the margins. As John said, we have a lot of experience around Industrial Packaging businesses, and we're taking full advantage of that and leveraging that know-how across the business. But just locally, it's a market we know, it's a market that we believe in long term, and we've got a lot of talent there. So getting the right talent in the right spots is a critical part of our success. Lastly, we like our customer base. We think we're aligned with a really good set of customers and have been for a long time. We had a couple of customers who struggled in their own markets in the first quarter, and they'll probably struggle as we go through part of this year. But overall, I think people, we've got a lot of cost improvement opportunities and we've got a great customer base.","John V. Faraci","I think we're done and just for me to say -- to wrap it up. We continue to see this year shaping up as a good one for International Paper with a meaningful improvement in EBITDA and with strong free cash flow. We look forward in giving you a further update on that when we report our second quarter results late July. Thank you.","Jay Royalty","So thanks, John, and thanks, again, to all of you for taking the time to join us this morning.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Jay Royalty, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jay Royalty","Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining International Paper's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties which are outlined on slide 2 of the presentation. We will also present certain non-U. S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter 2015 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide 4 provides context around joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark Sutton","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for your interest in International Paper and for taking time to join our quarterly call. I'm going to start on slide 5. International Paper delivered a solid performance in the first quarter. Our team successfully managed the business to improve margins and improve earnings. This is enabling International Paper to continue to deliver strong results. Extreme weather had some impact on our results in North America.","Although, our operations overall performed well. We saw particularly strong results out of the Ilim joint venture in Russia. As margins expanded due to our strong export position. Our research in EBITDA margin, absolute EBITDA and free cash flow, all improved year-over-year. Overall, we're pleased with how we operated and with our results in the first quarter. We feel like we're off to a good start to 2015. Continuing with our financial results on slide 6. EPS was $0.84 a share for the first quarter. And, this includes $0.04 of unfavorable Ilim FX impact. Our EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. EBITDA grew by $32 million year-over-year. And, free cash flow improved to $319 million, up from $252 million in the first quarter of 2014.","If we dive a little deeper into margins, you can see on slide 7 that we're successfully managing our margins across our key businesses. Global dynamics are different in each of these regions and across the businesses. But, our teams are finding ways to drive improved performance in the face of these challenges. Despite the economic backdrop, we're finding ways to continue to win and improve results. And, with that, I'll turn it over to Carol to cover the details in the quarter and the second-quarter outlook.","Carol Roberts","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Looking at the sequential bridge to the $0.84. Prices in mix were slightly unfavorable and volume was lower due to seasonality in Brazil and lower volume in industrial packaging. As Mark mentioned, operations were solid even with some winter weather impact in North America. Input costs were favorable, particularly for energy and diesel.","However, I would note that the diesel benefit was largely offset by higher distribution rates. And, we saw the favorable - large favorable swing for Ilim. With most of this coming from a less severe ruble devaluation against the U.S. dollar, compared to what occurred in the prior quarter. And, as Mark mentioned, on an absolute basis, the $0.84 for the first quarter does include a $0.04 unfavorable Ilim FX charge. Moving to slide 9. In industrial packaging, beginning with price. Most of the impact we experienced in the quarter was on lower export prices. Which, were largely a function of currency and the impacts of the strong U.S. dollar? Volume was lower. As shipments were impacted by weather, along with lower demand from several of our largest customers.","Year-over-year, our shipments were up 1% on a same-day basis. And finally, operations and input costs were favorable sequentially. Partially offset by higher planned maintenance outage expense in the quarter, as expected. And, as you saw on the margin slide that was previously shown by Mark. Overall, another strong quarter for our industrial packaging business. Moving to consumer packaging on slide 10. Mix improved slightly and volume was favorable in North America. Input costs in North America were a tailwind as well. Partially offset by higher distribution rates.","The first quarter is typically a higher-cost operating quarter in North America, due to seasonality. And, this was only made worse by the periods of extreme winter weather. And, if you think about that, it's just about how cold it was and some of the energy implications that it takes to run some of these big integrated mills. Additionally, the business incurred some additional cost with the difficult startup at Augusta, following the annual outage there. But in total, a much stronger start to the year for consumer packaging in 2015.","In printing papers, we experienced some softness in North American pulp and paper pricing, along with a less favorable mix in Brazil. Which, was due to seasonally lower domestic demand? The Brazil seasonality accounted for the majority of the lower volume as well. Which, was further amplified by the weak market conditions in the region? Operations and other costs were negatively impacted by negative weather.","Along with a one-time charge for the write-off of a project which we chose to abandon. Lower input costs for diesel and energy were offset by some commercial pressure and higher distribution rates. And finally, there was some modest unfavorable FX impacts for the quarter. As FX headwinds in Europe were greater than the net tailwinds we experienced in Brazil. Turning to Ilim on slide 12. The JV turned in its second consecutive quarter of very strong performance on the back of expanding margins.","Driven by its strong export position. And now, is the lowest-cost softwood pulp producer on the globe. Operational EBITDA for the quarter was $186 million, up 62% from Q1 2014. The JV did experience a modest negative non-cash FX related accounting charge of $47 million. Associated with the U.S. dollar denominated net debt, which was $1.2 billion for the first quarter.","The JV remains focused on cost management and post-project optimization. To stay ahead of rising inflation and to offset the tough economic conditions in the country. Ilim expects lower earnings in the second quarter before considering any FX impact from the accounting treatment on the debt. Due to a $10 million maintenance outage that's scheduled at the big brocks mills and higher inflation. So, moving to the outlook for the second quarter. Volume will be up for our North American packaging business. With one more day and seasonal strengthenity.","Particularly, in industrial packaging with the onset of the ag season. The industrial packaging volume is expected to increase by approximately 4% quarter over quarter. Consumer volume will increase as well. Due to the strengthening backlog. Volume in Brazil papers will increase as we move past the seasonal weakness of the first quarter. Pricing is expected to be largely flat across the businesses. With the exception of Brazil, where paper prices are increasing in local currency. And, mix is expected to improve in North American paper and pulp. Good operational performance across most of the businesses is expected to continue.","With some improvement in North American paper, North American industrial packaging, and North American consumer packaging. Due to less weather impact and seasonally stronger demand. In Brazil, we're beginning to see some signs of fiscal policy tightening. As the government begins to do things to egress the growing budget deficit.","And, we're seeing line of sight that this may, and will probably, include lower export incentives, higher taxes, and potentially, tariffs on energy usage. Input costs are expected to remain stable as most of the benefit is already in the first quarter results. Distribution rates and wood costs are expected to remain, what we would consider as, relatively high. The second quarter is the heaviest maintenance outage quarter for the year. And, is increasing $65 million sequentially over first quarter.","And as we've talked about, Ilim's expected to continue to perform well. And, for the purposes of this outlook, we've assumed flat FX from where we exited the quarter. So, a non-repeat of that modest negative. But, the JV does expect this to be offset by the items that I mentioned regarding the brocks outage and higher inflation. And so, with that, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, Carol. So, now I'd like to shift gears a little bit as we close out the comments and go to Q& A. Take a few minutes to talk about value creation and what we're doing in International Paper. I'm on slide 14. This slide shows IP's ten-year journey to improve our return on invested capital results.","With the last five years being in excess of our goal to consistently deliver results above our cost of capital. Now, obviously we want to improve that spread above our cost of capital. But, we're demonstrating that we can be at, or exceed, our cost of capital which is a key measure for our value creation mindset at International Paper. It's the yardstick; ROIC is. That we measure investments by and make decisions in terms of what strategy we should deploy. Our primary intent is to increase the value of IP over time and we've been successfully doing that. And, we're excited about the path we're on.","This next slide highlights the main elements of IP's value creation and capital allocation strategy. As we've indicated, we're running our businesses consistently well and are generating strong free cash flow year in and year out. Averaging $1.8 billion annually over the last several years. This has enabled us to strengthen our balance sheet, provide adequate CapEx to sustain this strong level of performance, reinvest in our core businesses, and return significant cash to shareholders.","We intend to continue this balanced use of cash approach to keep the company on sound financial footing, to reward our shareholders, and to increase the value of International Paper. Our dividend policy and actions are clear. And, there are - there's more room to grow. We've been opportunistic with our share buyback program. Taking advantage of dips to buy shares at an average price below our intrinsic value.","And, this has become an important tool and a good way to supplement return of cash to shareholders. I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter, we completed the initial $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. As of today's call, we have bought back roughly $120 million of shares since the first of the year on the new authorization. Additionally, we continue to look for good ideas in which to invest. Whether they're to strengthen and improve results within our existing businesses. Or, selective M&A opportunities that are the right fit for IP and can be accretive to ROIC and our results. I'd like now to turn your focus to a couple of great examples that we've recently announced and are acting on.","The first, on slide 16, is an update on our strategic reinvestment at the Valliant Mill. As you're aware, we made the decision to restart the number three container board machine at Valliant last year. And, our team has been actively working toward that objective for the last several months. We're excited to report that the machine is up and running now, ahead of schedule and making salable product at this time. This machine fills a large whole in our medium capacity with the roll off of the purchase obligations that were created with the mills that we divested as part of the Temple-Inland acquisition.","Valliant is well-positioned to serve our needs to the South, where we have a large presence in the box market, as well as the West Coast markets. This additional capacity also enables us to cost-effectively handle the expected growth in specialty, craft liner board exports and our North American box markets. It also gives us additional flexibility to meet the needs and maintain our low-cost position. While we continue to balance our system supply with our overall customer demand.","And, it goes back to what we've talked about before. And that being, our multi-channel strategy the we deploy in our industrial packaging business. It's a very attractive deployment of capital; an existing facility with expected returns in excess of 25%. We expect this project to ramp up over the balance of 2015. And, it's a great addition to an already very good container board mill system. Next project I'd like to talk about is the con - is the project to convert our Riegelwood, North Carolina mill to a 100% pulp. To meet the growing needs of our fluff pulp customers of the next several years.","This project involves the removal of 350,000 tons of coated paperboard capacity at the Riegelwood Mill. Much of which is dedicated to the production of coated bristles for the printing markets, under our Carolina brand. We're selling the Carolina brand to MeadWestvaco and repositioning the coated paperboard business to focus more on the packaging grades of coated board. And, to free up the capacity to make the fluff pulp and softwood pulp at the Riegelwood Mill.","The conversion will provide additional pulp capacity of 400,000 tons at Riegelwood, and will bring our North American pulp system to 1.7 million tons. Importantly, 1.4 million of that is capable of making high-quality fluff pulp. This is the latest in a series of conversions to expand our fluff pulp business. By the way, a business we've been in since 1984 out of our Georgetown Mill. The coated paperboard capacity that we make in the coated bristles area will be shut down by early 2016.","And, the new pulp capacity will be online by mid-2016. Riegelwood will have the capacity, or the capability, excuse me, to flex this capacity as our market needs demand. Between market softwood pulp and fluff pulp. This - the decision to convert the mill was based on the opportunity to grow with the market and our customers in the attractive fluff pulp market. We have the best customers in the market and the best growing markets geographically throughout the world. It also allows us to streamline our coated paperboard system.","We intend to support our coated paperboard customers. And, the attractive growth segments, as I mentioned, in food service and consumer packaging grades out of our top rated mills in Texarkana, Texas and Augusta, Georgia. This investment of $135 million at Riegelwood has an expected return of greater than 20%. So in closing, International Paper continues to perform well today.","We like the positions we've built in the key markets where we've chosen to operate. And, the businesses - in the businesses that are needle movers for IP. These strong positions, along with great execution by our teams on the ground, are enabling IP to manage margins and increase profitability. Regardless of what the market throws at us.","We realize the world is a dynamic place and we're mindful of global demand, trade flows, and the implications of a strong U.S. dollar. But, given our strong positions and our great customer base, we feel it's all manageable.","We have a solid pipeline of high return capital opportunities, a couple of which I've just highlighted, that'll enable us to successfully deploy capital and increase value. Our strong free cash flow generation enables us to fund these attractive opportunities.","While continuing to return an attractive level of cash to our shareholders. All in, we remain excited about where we are, the path we're on, and what's out in front of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jay and open it up for questions.","Jay Royalty","Operator, we're ready to take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon","My first question has to do with well I have a couple of questions. One is the timing of the regal would conversion obviously the fluff pulp market is very attractive given its growth in international markets with rising living standards. And I know is close to the port of Wellington and news and export product. But the timing seems interesting to us because of the fact that other capacity is coming on. There is another player that might need to participate temporarily as a deal with the conversion. Themselves. So we were curious about that and wondered why now. And the second question has to do with could you remind us of your container board mill and box integration level in Europe proper? I guess excluding Russia?","Mark Sutton","Chip I will ask Mike who runs our consumer packaging business and North American papers to take the first one and Tim Nicholls will do the second question.","Mike Amick","As far as the timing of the regal would conversion without really referencing what others may or may not doing we are just reacting to the need that we have within our system to meet the strategic business and the demands that we see growing across the world. So this decision is very timely for us. And were excited about the opportunity and the value this will create for our customers and for share owners going forward.","Chip Dillon","And then on the integration levels in Europe?","Tim Nicholls","They're pretty small because most of the business over there is focused on industrial and test liner. We do have a big fresh fruit and vegetable segment and we do sell board out of North America and we are the main supplier for craft Virgin, but on a total bases and this is a little bit of a round number, but I would say we are probably close to 15 to [indiscernible] percent of their total by. But a big portion of the Virgin craft piece.","Chip Dillon","Just real quickly to follow back on the fluff conversion. Could you just remind us how much or how different it is selling fluff pulp to a typical consumer products company versus selling paper grade even into tissue and certainly into regular paper. To find at least important to have some staying power to the market . To the contracts tend to be a little bit longer and the standards, do people specify certain Mills etc.?","Mike Amick","It is a technical cell. It is a product that requires a fair amount of engineering and qualification process is quite lengthy. So it is a sale. As I said it's a qualification process. And there are typically contracts as well. But that varies depending upon the customer and the situation.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub","Two quick ones. First of all as you noted there have been lots of shifting dynamics. I believe at the end of the last quarter you had laid out a goal were expectation of about a 5% improvement in EBITDA for this year is that something you think is still doable?","Mark Sutton","We do. If the year is one quarter down and three corners to go. It's a steep challenge as we laid out. But we do believe we need to shoot for 5% EBITDA growth. We have some plans that put us within striking distance of that and we are hopeful and we've got a lot of time left in the year to do that.","We've probably got about a 4% year-over-year in the first quarter but the challenges steeper. But that something we still have our eyes on.","Mark Weintraub","And then second if I look at I think at slide 22 you show market downtime for your different businesses. And container board for the first time since second quarter 2015 perhaps, you didn't take any market downtime. Yet at the same time you can see that the volumes in your industrial business both versus the first quarter and versus the year ago though very slightly versus the year ago there was a bit of a negative hit. So there seems to be almost a little bit of a surprise that for the first time in a while where you're actually seeing a little bit of the negative hit on the volume side where you're not taking any market downtime in container board. Can you maybe talk us through a little bit through the thought process there?","Mark Sutton","As you can imagine there's a number of things going on Mark. First of all were buying less board on the outside because we have less requirement to do so. We are needing to take board for all of our channels to market. Second of all were getting ready for what is going to be our largest outage quarter of the whole year. It's a big step up first quarter was big it's a big step or up the first quarter. And then lastly we ran better in the first quarter than we did in the fourth. But we still didn't run particularly well so we were scrambling a bit to try to get the building product in our pipeline are going to need as we go through the area.","Mark Weintraub","So at the end of the day would you say your inventory situation is just where you want to be in container board?","Mark Sutton","Not quite, we built 60,000 inventory we would've liked a probably a little bit more. If you think about it in terms of our system that\u2019s less than two days of production and we\u2019re going through a very heavy season. So it's close to what we wanted but probably a little bit on the light side.","Operator","Your next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Staphos","I'm wondering dive back into consumer and by box board markets and I missed this, I remember we were having two machines could you relay or rewrite how much you're taking out of the Bristol market and then the related question how do you see the folding box board markets in now in terms of in terms of supply demand balance specifically in North America?","Mike Amick","Your first question was around the printing piece of that. That business represents about 15% of our total capacity. So roughly in the neighborhood of call it 250,000 tons of capacity is what's being made at our Riegelwood facility directed at printing papers market.","Mark Sutton","From a supply demand balance I guess you're asking really on a worldwide basis. You're still seeing we are still seeing a large supply position out there relative to demand. And that's something that we understand and we look at and manage but that still the case.","George Staphos","Maybe backing up and segueing off of your earlier questions how much of the conversion here was driven by the opportunities you see in fluff pulp and how much was a recognition of a potential supply demand imbalance in the future in the box board markets? I know it's hard to be precision like in your comment here but were interested in your thoughts.","Mark Sutton","This is one of these situations that come up maybe not too often where you've got a win-win. This was primarily a move driven by our fluff position. And trying to improve our position in that business. For the long-term.","George Staphos","Okay. I guess to last ones in alternate over. Bigger picture you've done a great job of improving as you've pointed out this part of your cost of capital market or the last couple of years. And you intend to continue that. How do you see the strategy shifting at IP if at all to manage and grow that spread. Do you see that being driven by things you do within your capital structure? To improve the spread? Or do you see it being driven more by investment and within investment you see it being more by acquisition opportunities or more the sorts of things like Valliant and Riegelwood? Thanks and I will turn it over.","Mark Sutton","I think for a company that has a scale that we haven't to be able to move the needle you have to keep all of your strategic options available to you. So it's probably will be a little bit of all of the above that you just talked about. For I think you will see is more opportunities with projects like Valliant the build upon a strong position business or region and to improve that position. And that something that we have not really done a lot of lately because we were doing some large M&A work and sort of build the company we have today. So I think some of this goes in cycles but back to my comments on ROIC the measure to look at where you know work to create value against that backdrop looking to maintain a solid spread above our cost of capital, and what we do will need to pass that test.","Operator","Your next question is from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail Glazerman","Carol or Mark expand the project abandonment can you quantify how much the charge was and will that be the option for the paper machine down at [indiscernible]?","Carol Roberts","Gail, I would prefer not to call out exactly what it is because it would give some insight into some of the stuff but it was pretty much in accounting thing. We go ahead and approve code I funds for capital and once we make a decision let's they were not going to permit pursue something let's keep her book straight. It was enough that I felt that we needed to call it out but that's about the detail I'll be guilty give you.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Can you talk a little bit about what's been going on the uncoated free she market are you seeing any response in the market to the threat of duties and any view on what might happen in June?","Mike Amick","As you're seeing as you're seeing reported in the industry numbers, there has been some pullback in reduction in imports coming into the U.S.. As far as going from a kind of a timeline standpoint the IPC rules is now on the hands of the Department of Commerce. And we'll see expect to see an answer or ruling from them on duties or potential duties sometime in June.","Gail Glazerman","And that have you heard from customers that you might've lost last year reports coming in? Are you seeing that or is it just with the demand supply and that's kind of offsetting it?","Mark Sutton","We haven't seen that Gail.","Gail Glazerman","Can you give a little bit of color what you're seeing in currently in terms of the box market if you look into the second quarter and maybe a little bit of color on as well?","Mark Sutton","We\u2019re seeing a seasonal pickup in April. The first court economic activity was lighter than we would have hoped coming into the quarter. We had a little bit of a soft margin things kind of settled out but I think that we are seeing kind of a normal seasonal pickup and second quarter is a big order for us. It's a lot of fresh fruit and vegetable and so I'd say April so far is seasonally up.","Gail Glazerman","And export demand?","Mark Sutton","Export demand has been pretty good. You read all the headlines from the newspapers and you'd think that it would take a hit, but we've seen the FX in Europe from a demand standpoint it's been really consistent.","Operator","Next question is from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey","Looking at the first quarter box shipment number for IP versus the industry can you just talk about the drivers of the underperformance. Why IP's number came in later and looking forward is the expectation for the balance of the year that the volume number could potential he lag the industry?","Mark Sutton","What we constantly do is make choices around customers. And some of what hit us in the first quarter was choices around customer mix that we had made in the fourth quarter and those finally came fully through. In the first quarter. Yes over the next quarter or two we could be caught depending on what the market does, down a little bit or close. But what we\u2019re trying to do is manage the portfolio across all the segments that we serve to make sure we're picking the right pieces of the business to make right sense for us for long-term. So it's kind of a constant evaluation that we go through and we were a little bit light in the quarter. But I don't think that is be concerned.","Alex Ovshey","And then thinking about your European container board business box business you supply a lot of your craft lighter board from the U.S. but you mentioned that the test liner is purchased locally. Is there a strategic benefit from potentially integrating that converting business in Europe with mill assets? Can you talk us through that scenario?","Mark Sutton","We evaluate the test liner integration benefits and level on a continuous basis. There was a time where we were 35% integrated we had a mill in France that we closed. We have good integration level in our business in Morocco, we have a couple of mills in Turkey, we really look at it on in available paper type of segments we choose to participate in. Our business as I've mentioned before is largely built around the Mediterranean region and fresh food areas that a heavy craft liner and semi can media market. That's the primary focus of that market.","And we view the craft liner as an extension in between our North American box system. So as we think about strategic development of the business the need to make some of our own test liner or more than we do today will continuously be evaluated. But there is ample supply in Europe for companies that are configured like us so the availability of the paper is there. It has to be the right economic and has to be the right quality. With the way to different products were making. There could be a scenario where make sense to make more but right now we feel like our position is in a good spot will be evaluated on a continuous basis and will be in and out overtimes of test liner.","Alex Ovshey","If I can just ask one quick one on Ilim I think you talked with a normal EBITDA out of the business of about $600 million. With all the puts and takes do we think run track to be able to achieve that number in 2015? And what would be the cash dividend that would be associated with having an EBITDA number that's close to the $600 million number?","Carol Roberts","I think there is a good shot to hit that number a lot will depend on how things turn out. We are performing well we've got graced cost positions a lot of depend on demand out of China for pulp and kind of where the currency goes another stakes. Relative to the dividend it's going to be very cash positive so a lot of that will depend on Ilim board will make that decision will be around that debt covenants and will be for lack of cash. So we feel very good about that business and think we\u2019re going to have a very strong year.","Operator","Your next question is from Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Alex [indiscernible] on for Phil, thanks for taking my question. So the strong dollars have been at headwind for expert between her board prices but there's also been some container board price increased in Europe and Brazil, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of export prices and your outlook prices begin to firm up?","Tim Nicholls","Most of the movement that we've seen as really been currency related out of Europe. We haven't really seen any movement and other regions world. And the price we've announced price increases on Europe shipments is there going out we started earlier this year but that's only made up about half of the impact on currency so I'd say it's Europe on currency and yes there's some pressure, there's been some spot prices here and there but nothing structural that we have seen so far in other parts of the world.","Unidentified Analyst","And just one follow. I appreciate the color on April box trend seasonally is any way you can give a comp on apples to apples year-over-year basis?","Tim Nicholls","We'll see how the quarter plays on talk to you the end of the second quarter. Like I said it's usually our strongest quarter in terms of volume. And we\u2019re seeing seasonal lift so far. So we feel okay about it.","Operator","Your next question is from Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Al Kabili","I guess the question for Tim is just on the opportunity for further optimization in the container board business. Can you just update us where we are at their in North America and if there is any specific targeted improvement that you have for this year on that?","Tim Nicholls","Well we are constantly looking every year we have a certain amount of initiative baked in and it's across the board. We had extremely good performance in our converting operations in the first quarter both on waste on per foot. In the middle system we are targeting cash costs every year. We did not run as well as we wanted to in the first quarter but we ran a lot better than that in the fourth quarter and we feel good about the rest of the year. So it's going to be running the mills more reliably and running better from a input consumption standpoint. Supply chain continues to be a big opportunity for us.","And running the mills reliably helps that because we there's freight logical statements from mills to converting facilities and when were up and down in mill facilities it makes it a little bit harder to keep supply chain in line. I think we've got a pretty good plan for this year in terms of improvement. Across converting mills and.","Al Kabili","And just on I know the export had sort of in the majority of the pricing sequentially in the business. But from the medium published medium price cuts do you see any meaningful impact from that? Or maybe can call it what that impact is. I would think there might be a sequential drag as you see the full impact in that into queue although maybe light. Thanks","Tim Nicholls","Yes I don't to get going to be a huge shift for us. I just don't see the medium having a big impact on performance systems.","Al Kabili","Okay and the final question is just on the West Coast is going through another pretty severe drought this year. I know that impacted you last year. Any early read on what the impact might be this year?","Mark Sutton","It's hard to tell what happens to the course of the year a little bit the first quarter. Second quarter is when we naturally pick up around produce fresh fruit and vegetables so we'll have to see. Yet still dry. What has helped is the port situation. Just there were agricultural products that were sitting in ports spoiling. Among other things. And having that resolved in the supply chain starting to correct themselves is going to be a help.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark Connelly","Just one question [indiscernible] used to talk about capital spending versus depreciation levels geographically that he was spending more capital and growth markets overseas and less in the U.S.. As we think about the new spending and the new initiatives that you're making in the U.S. as that changed dramatically. And when you think that balance of To depreciation domestically and overseas is going to be over the next couple of years?","Mark Sutton","I think some of the spending that you referenced really was about hoping some position and some new markets. All most by design you're going to spend early on greater depreciation. I think our view is spending is up percentage of Bruce appreciation more portly IBR capital spend it as a percentage of our revenue and where we think we can generate these returns on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital. Again back to that is a more focused filter work that's where you'll begin to see more capital in the strategic reinvestment category invested where we really believe we can create that sustained value. And it will be looking at capital as a percentage of our revenue and also as a percentage of depreciation and looking at that together.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","Mark when I look at the two projects the Valliant restart and then I looked down at the regal conversion the Valliant project just when he 5% IRR is 20% plus the question is really going forward on these capital investments. Is there a belief within the company that we should be looking at lower IRR's on future investments, is at the quick correct way to read that?","Mark Sutton","Not sure I understand why you would include that are you thinking maybe we did the highest once first? Correct","Scott Gaffner","Correct exactly.","Mark Sutton","No that\u2019s not a good conclusion. What drives the timing on projects like this is the return is honestly important but there is an acceptable group of projects Mike described the market demands of our customers. The timing of bringing product into the market. You think about Valliant part of that timing was based on May versus by and the role of our agreements. On the fluff project we have the customer base we want and that customer base so that drove the timing more than it was the highest to returns we had. So I think the kinds of projects you'll be seeing in the future will be in this range and better. Not worse.","Scott Gaffner","I appreciate you clearing that up. Just following up on exports. Obviously pricing's been a little bit pressure just because the FX component. But when you look at shipping costs have you noticed a significant offset there from lower shipping cost into the export regions that might benefit?","Mark Sutton","I think that for the whole company because we export a lot of things from the U.S.. I don't Nick we've seen a significant offset in the export arena . They are puts and takes but nothing that's shown up materially as an offset to the pressures you described.","Operator","Next question is from Dr. Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Mark, I wondered if you could first will update us I think you've been doing some kind of recent around the whole international portfolio with the company it sounded like China had been under the biggest question for you and I wondered if you be willing to talk about that?","Mark Sutton","I can't talk about anything in detail. The what you're referring to is we talked about a couple calls and as a couple of conferences and that is we constantly need to reevaluate our positions in our strategy and looking at places that we really believe on the long-term International Paper can win.","So the international regions that we are in today are under evaluation and as you can see from decisions we've made even domestically with the coated paperboard repositioning our positions in the U.S. are under evaluation all against the backdrop of can we win long-term and produce returns that are in excess of our cost of capital. Maybe not all at the same time in any moment at time but that's the goal, get the company's return on invested capital to be balanced in any part of the company in the long-term contribute to the target. With that as backdrop we have work to do I'm not prepared to talk about any conclusions, but rest assured that work is being done.","Mark Wilde","I wonder just looking at volumes quarter to quarter and year-over-year couple of them really jumped out at me. One was the drop off in the Asian quoted board volumes and the other was the weakness in the Brazilian uncoated paper volumes. I guess particularly with Brazil and other Brazil is weak but I also know that a weaker the business should be much Mark competitive from an expert standpoint.","Mark Sutton","I think in the Brazil piece one of the issues with the IP numbers was we had a tremendous first quarter in 2014. Without the lion share some incremental demand the came out of some government programs and we didn't have that this particular quarter. So our comp was particularly difficult. But we are not losing our position in our business in our margins in the paper business in Brazil, we're still very strong.","It was really more of a timing and comp issue more than anything else in the Brazil paper demand paper drop off. Now the coated board in China I think part of what we\u2019re doing in our coated board business in China we made those investments to make the high-end of the market.","And were continuing to upgrade our mix and in some cases base on the supply demand economics and margin pressures it was the right economic decision for us to make less of those lower and general folding carton grades and more of the higher-end grades that go into more sophisticated packaging. And just make less product to make a better result. So that demand relative to the market is self-inflicted and the right decision for us because our strategy was to make the high-end grades.","Mark Wilde","The last thing I wanted to do is just circle back on that three times leverage target that you have had Mark. And I just like some updated thoughts on how important getting down to that level is for you. And what you'd be willing to go up to in the short-term for a transaction?","Mark Sutton","I think it is no change in our view on that. I think the three times leverage is the right place for International Paper over time. You've obviously seen us go above that that we did it and we got it back they quickly. So I think the strategy we would have on any kind of investment that would require us to increase our leverage would be along those lines where if we did it, we already have a plan to get it back . And as we announced the transaction the transaction to be announced in the plan of how we get our leverage `we think it's important the long-term health the company and to be a long-term value creator that being in that zone is important.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Chris Manuel","Just a couple of follow-up from earlier questions. First I looking at fleet slide 32 refer to year-over-year price in your North American container board being down a chunk and I guess I'm presuming a lot of that I'm sorry currency driven. Can you maybe talk about the appetite or how you think about particular given your strategy as a using the European operations is an expert be three North American Mills is how you feel about needing to recover or maintain certain price cost relationships. Additionally you've got some inflation stuff you've mentioned logistics and freight that event up a bit. How do you think about maintaining a recovering some elements for your system?","Mark Sutton","First of all we shift through multiple channels and we expect all those channels to earn their keep. So when we see margin pressure were looking for ways to recover that or shift from one channel to another. So we did get hit on the container port side with currency and we've had a number of increases that we've pushed through as we went through the first part of the year we haven't recovered all the currency impact.","I'm not sure which slide you're looking at it if you're looking at the container business on page 31 most of what you see there is pretty small movements. And most of that is mix. We just experience. Should. We sell to a lot of customers or a lot of different types of boxes there is a fairly broad distribution of price given box construction. And so most of what you see there is mix on price as of the boxes were selling. Margins are margin structure from quarter to quarter was dead flat.","Chris Manuel","Okay. Second question was if I can follow up from an earlier one as well. Have your customers approached you would all particular West Coast customers fruit and vegetable process etc. regarding, the drug has been an issue, if they come at you and suggest that any sense that we may have 510% lower needs given a shortages of water things of that nature. That's directionally some of the color we've heard regarding outlooks or thoughts regarding some of the crops, but your color would be helpful.","Mark Sutton","We have not.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover","So a lot of these things have been asked. Starting with one, obviously currency wasn't the problem on the bottom line. But the revenues missed the consensus pre-substantially. Some wondering if that is the FX and you can qualify the impact.","Carol Roberts","Steve, the FX was a big factor translating those Brazilian sales in the euro sales in two dollars was a big impact. And that's the majority of it.","Steve Chercover","And secondly down year-over-year sequentially and xpedx is discontinued op is a good run rate to use in the low 400s now?","Mark Sutton","Can you say that again you broke up on the first part of the question?","Steve Chercover","Selling and admin expenses are down year-over-year and sequentially. And I believe xpedx has already been discontinued so I wondering if a good run rate is now in the low 400 range?","Carol Roberts","It probably is but think about the first quarter is probably a lower cost quarter because we have an annual increase that hits April 1. But there could be a little bit of movement it should be reasonable. The only other area there would be incentive comp can move around quarter to quarter and that is not insignificant.","Steve Chercover","Final question, it's sounds like there is still some runway for Ilim after the work is done. Can we see that thing approach maybe $50 million as a line item quarter in quarter out?","Carol Roberts","I would hesitate to quote a number. I would have to go back and do the math. One thing I would say because it is a pulp business it is going to be a bit of a cyclical is this your going to have some peaks that are going to be really awesome and you don't know when those might be, so it could be a very strong number that I would have to go back and look before I would speculate on where the earnings would be, but Jay would be a good one follow-up on that.","Operator","And your final question is from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Mark, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the consumer packaging business following Riegelwood you have two world-class SBS Mills here, but you don't have the full converting capabilities few of your large publicly traded competitors. So as you look at this business long-term would you look to get bigger in converting or would you maybe looked continue to streamline the business. Is it strategically important to be an SBS long-term or you content to do with the asset base of now?","Mark Sutton","The consumer packaging business not only in the U.S. but globally where we do it, we do some of that business in Europe. We do some in China. Is an important business for us. We are surgically targeted to certain segments with certain substrates. We don't have a full line of substrates we don't have a full line of converting and that seems to be working for us. In our recent history we've tried some other methods to grow that business with other types of converting. With varying degrees of success or lack thereof. So we\u2019re going to be very careful with how we look to grow that business, but it is an important business for us. We really like the North American SBS base business and the converting that we do.","But again back to my earlier comments anything we do in consumer packaging or any of the other businesses we will have to be convinced that it drives the return on invested capital of the overall company. And even though we have two mill system or emerging into a two mill system SBS for packaging grades those are two enormous mills that have a significant capacity and product capability that are best in class in the world. So I don't go by the number of mills I look at the number of customers we serve and the growth rates of those customers and where we think we can add value and be competitive. And that will be the test we use on whether or not we grow and more converting. It's not, we just need to do it to be like every else, it's about value creation.","Anthony Pettinari","And then just trying to Brazil top demand environment potentially higher taxes and tariffs on energy usages, given all those challenges is there a way to quantify the potential for EBITDA margin improvement at Orsa or to quantify that runway? And then putting aside some of the bad external things, what are the kind of the actions you can take internally at Orsa to improve performance of the business?","Mark Sutton","The Brazil packaging business is in the same market, experiencing the same dynamics as our paper business. So demand has been a challenge. What we have done is we have improved internally how we're operating the mills that we have there. They are relatively small mills by our U.S. scale but they have the same kinds of challenges and problems so we are deploying our capabilities of manufacturing excellence and other tools we use to improve those mills. And we\u2019re seeing some results there.","So internal self-help improvement on how we operate. And on the box plants it's a number of things. It's improving our capability to serve customers through the supply chain improvements and also adding a little bit of automation to lower our fixed cost and we are making progress on all those fronts. We\u2019re not losing position in our packaging business. We've got some really important customers that are having a tough go of it and so as their business contracts a bit we contract. So we've got to figure out the commercial side and replace some of that business but I think when the economy in Brazil improves, when the government reforms take hold the packaging business is going to be much better positioned to perform in a better environment than it was when we made the acquisition.","Operator","At this time I'll turn it back for Mr. Royalty for closing remarks","Jay Royalty","Okay thanks. That will conclude today's call. Thanks Mark and Carol and all. And thanks to all of you for joining us this morning.

At this time, we would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Company Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. We do ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question.","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President-Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.","Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.","Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.","Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation to those figures is available on our website.","Our website also contains copies of the third quarter 2018 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and the Graphic Packaging investments, slide 2 also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities.","I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on slide 3. International Paper delivered very strong performance in the third quarter with more than 50% earnings growth year-over-year and building on our solid performance in the first half of the year. We expect the momentum in our businesses to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2019.","Coming back to the third quarter, we had solid commercial performance and continued price realization across our three businesses. And, overall, we see continued healthy demand for our products globally. We are facing cost headwinds from distribution and most of our inputs, but again we see this as a reflection of the strong economy that we're operating in and the healthy underlying demand for our products. Our operations performed well in a lighter planned maintenance outage quarter and our teams managed extremely well through Hurricane Florence.","Tim will cover the financial impact of Hurricane Florence in more detail. But, first, I want to thank the employees in our company who were impacted by the historic storm for their commitment to prepare, recover and restart our facilities safely and clearly in the face of their own personal hardship. I'm also very proud of the response by the IP family. IP and our Employee Relief Fund provided $1.8 million in emergency funds at the time it was needed to more than 1,200 employees to assist them with the basic needs in the aftermath of the storm. I think this is a great example of what we call The o \u2013 doing the right things and the right ways for the right reasons all of the time.","Turning to the financial results on slide 4, revenue increased by more than 7% year-over-year on solid commercial performance and continued healthy demand. EBITDA improved by nearly 18% year-over-year with very strong margin expansion across our three businesses.","Our North American Industrial Packaging business performed very well. We are ahead of the industry volume growth in the third quarter, driven by our focus on segments that are benefiting from strong secular growth trend","Our Global Cellulose Fibers business delivered record fluff pulp shipments in the third quarter despite the impact of Hurricane Florence, and our Papers business delivered very strong results globally with outstanding commercial and operational performance. Our equity earnings in the quarter were $92 million dollars, which includes $74 million from our Ilim joint venture and $19 million from our ownership interest in Graphic Packaging.","Free cash flow accelerated in the third quarter on very strong cash from operations and lower CapEx versus the second quarter as we expected. All in, the company delivered a very strong performance and we managed it extremely well through the hurricane.","I'll now turn it over to Tim who will cover the performance across our three businesses as well as our fourth quarter outlook. Tim?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. I'm on slide 5 which shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share bridge. Operating earnings improved $0.37 sequentially, driven by strong commercial performance and lower planned maintenance outage expense. Third quarter results were negatively impacted by $36 million related to Hurricane Florence. During the quarter, we also had a favorable one-time true-up of $24 million across all businesses that will not repeat in the fourth quarter. This was mainly related to lower health and medical benefit cost.","And in operations and cost, we also had higher expenses related to the Madrid mill start-up. Input costs and distribution were unfavorable, with higher costs sequentially across most inputs. The distribution environment remains very tight and our businesses continue to work aggressively to mitigate the impact. Corporate expense and taxes were favorable with a 24% effective tax rate driven by discrete tax benefits in the quarter.","Lastly, equity earnings were higher sequentially despite a non-cash FX charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated debt which works out to be about a $0.06 deduction to our EPS. As Mark said, it was a very strong performance for the company.","Turning to slide 6, I'll provide more details on the financial impact of Hurricane Florence. As I mentioned earlier, we had a $36 million impact in the third quarter, which includes $8 million in volume and $28 million in operations. Looking ahead, we expect a $15 million impact in the fourth quarter, mostly in our Global Cellulose Fibers business.","With regard to insurance recovery, we're currently working with our providers to determine the potential recovery, but do not expect any material proceeds in the fourth quarter. I'd also point out that the hurricane is deemed as a single event, so our deductible will be $20 million across the enterprise.","So, I'll start with the segments on slide 7, first with our North American or Industrial Packaging business, and in North America, the business performed very well delivering $622 million in earnings and a 24% EBITDA margin. By the end of the quarter, we had realized 90% of our recent box price increase. And overall, we continue to see healthy demand across all channels. I'll have more on that in just a minute.","Input and distribution costs were a headwind in the third quarter across most inputs, including recovered fiber which increased by $14 million sequentially. Performance in our European Packaging business was impacted by start-up and commissioning cost as well as the overhead burden of a mill that was not at a full ramp. All in, that was a $25 million dollar impact in the quarter. Additionally, box demand was seasonally lower and we experienced especially weak fruit and vegetable demand due to adverse weather conditions.","A brief update on the Madrid mill. The mill started up in the quarter. We're making progress as we go through the checkout and test phase and we'll continue to ramp up operations and production as the quarter progresses. Overall, we're confident of the business fundamentals and very pleased with the strong performance in North America and momentum in the fourth quarter.","In Europe, we anticipate seasonally stronger demand and we'll start capturing integrated margins on recycled containerboard as the Madrid mill ramps up.","Coming back to the North American Packaging business on slide 8. An important contributor to our strong performance is our deliberate focus to serve the fastest-growing segments and be aligned with the best customers across all segments. While our scale and footprint enables us to serve just about every corrugated segment, we are leading the way in e-commerce, fresh produce and protein. Across the business, we have segment-specific innovation teams who work with our customers to develop value-creating packaging solutions.","This is ultimately how value is created from fiber to the consumer, and it is a driver of why our box shipments are outperforming the industry as reflected by our third quarter box shipments, which were up 1.5% year over year on a blended basis.","On slide 9, the Global Cellulose Fibers business delivered earnings of $85 million and 21% EBITDA margins in the third quarter, driven by strong commercial performance and price realization across our portfolio.","As I mentioned before, Hurricane Florence impacted results in the business by $28 million, which includes a $7 million impact to volume. Even with the hurricane, the business had record fluff pulp shipments of 8% growth year-over-year in the third quarter.","Our strong growth is driven by understanding and addressing our customers' needs. We have a unique and powerful innovation engine and an unmatched service model with global reach and local execution. And our multi-mill system allows us to deliver the value to customers in the fast-growing, absorbent markets around the world.","Part of that mill system advantage goes back to the conversion we undertook at Riegelwood in mid-2016. For us, it was the right decision at that time and has enabled us to support the strong growth we see today. We've delivered more than 450,000 tons of fluff pulp through our customers from Riegelwood which is right in-line with expectations.","Moving to Printing Papers on page 10. The business delivered outstanding results globally on strong commercial and operating performance as well as lower planned maintenance outage expense. EBITDA margins were 23% across the segment with all the regions contributing to a strong quarter. Input costs were a headwind in the quarter and year-over-year, driven by higher wood, energy and chemicals. And in North America, distribution costs remain a challenge. Overall, an extremely good quarter across all geographies.","On slide 11, the Ilim joint venture continues to deliver solid financial performance with operating EBITDA of $297 million and an EBITDA margin of 45% in the third quarter. That's before foreign exchange charges. Volume was down sequentially due to heavy planned maintenance outages in the quarter. IP's equity earnings were $74 million and were impacted by a non-cash foreign exchange charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt, of which IP's after-tax portion was $23 million. Taking a look at year-to-date performance, operating EBITDA through the third quarter is $898 million dollars, almost double last year at this time.","So, turning to the outlook on slide 12. In our Industrial Packaging business, we expect to see the last part of the recent price increase in North America. Volume is expected to be a $10 million benefit from stronger seasonal demand in North America and Europe. Operations are expected to be flat sequentially as improved mill operations and lower Madrid mill expenses are offset by the non-repeat of the third quarter true-up I mentioned earlier. Staying with Industrial Packaging, outage expense will be $57 million lower and input costs are expected to be stable.","In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, additional price realization will be largely offset by geographic and product mix in the fourth quarter. Volume is expected to be a $5 million benefit and operations are expected to improve by $5 million. Outage expense will be $3 million higher in the quarter.","In our Printing Papers business, we expect to see a $10 million benefit from our recent price increases and improved mix. Volume is also expected to improve sequentially on stronger seasonal demand in Latin America and Europe, with an expected benefit of $10 million. Operations are expected to be a $15 million headwind in the quarter. This includes approximately $10 million of currency headwinds in Brazil. Outage expense will be $3 million higher and input costs will be a $10 million headwind, largely due to higher wood cost in Brazil and Russia.","Under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture and investment in Graphic Packaging. And in other items, we include corporate and interest expense and our estimated effective tax rate for the fourth quarter.","On slide 13, turning to capital allocation. Last quarter, I shared with you our capital allocation framework and more specifics on how we will maximize value creation. I want to take a moment to update you on the recent actions and provide additional clarity on what you can expect from International Paper.","So, let's start with the balance sheet. In the quarter, we took a couple of actions to derisk our pension plan and further reduce our exposure to our pension liability. First, we executed a pension liability transfer of $1.6 billion, which was funded entirely with planned assets. We also, based on improved funding levels that we saw as we were exiting the quarter, we decided to adopt a more conservative approach on asset allocation, increasing our fixed income investments and reducing our allocation to equities. The key takeaway here is that we see no funding requirements on the horizon.","As I said last quarter, we will maintain a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating with a target debt-to-EBITDA of 2.5 to 2.8 times on a Moody's basis. We are currently at about 2.9, so improving our leverage ratio is a priority. Turning to cash back to shareholders, returning cash is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework and it will be as we go forward.","Earlier this month, we increased our dividend by 5.3% to $2 annually. This is the seventh consecutive annual increase since 2011 and reinforces our commitment to a competitive and sustainable dividend of 40% or 50% of free cash flow.","Also earlier this month, our board of directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. This is incremental to the $400 million remaining from a previous authorization at the end of the third quarter. And in the third quarter, we completed $200 million in share repurchases. Going forward, you can expect our share repurchases to be thoughtful and have a consistent cadence based on value.","Turning to investments and as we committed last quarter, M&A will be disciplined, selective and compelling. And we will invest to create through organic projects that are grounded on clear, strategic and financial logic. Currently, for 2018, we are expecting that our spending on capital will be approximately $1.6 billion due to the timing of spend on very attractive strategic projects.","And staying on the topic of capital allocation, I'll turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Tim. And on a related topic, I'd like to cover in this section of our call I want to share with you an update on our portfolio. After careful consideration, we have decided to explore strategic options for our Brazil Packaging business, including the possible sale of the business. Essentially, we have concluded that we cannot competitively serve the Brazil Packaging segment with the structure of our existing business. We plan to provide appropriate updates as we go forward.","And coming back to Tim's remarks on capital allocation, to me, it's all about value creation. That's what drives our decisions. Our approach to capital allocation reflects our confidence in International Paper's strong free cash flow generation and our long-term outlook.","Turning now to slide 14, I want to take this opportunity to share my views on International Paper and our performance. We delivered a very good third quarter and are well-positioned for a strong fourth quarter with momentum as we move into 2019.","We see continued healthy demand globally for our products, but that's not the whole story. The way I see it, it all starts with our customers and our focus on commercial excellence. There's a lot behind those words. It's all about making sure we have the customer relationships and the best value chain to solve their needs \u2013 from fiber to box, from fiber to fluff pulp, and from fiber to paper.","It's about International Paper's unique capabilities to solve our customers' unique needs. And speaking to packaging specifically, we're very confident in our ability to provide our customers with the best packaging solutions, because ultimately that's what matters \u2013 to be the preferred partner, to develop and supply the actual package.","Across all of our businesses, we have unique capabilities to thrive through just about any challenge we may face. We have the people, the innovation, the products and a low-cost, high-quality manufacturing system to succeed with our customers. And with that, we're ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is going to come from the line of Steve Chercover, D.A. Davidson.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions for me. First of all, it's good to know you still have about 10% of the containerboard price hike yet to be realized. And I'm just wondering, is it your client mix that is maybe a little slower in implementation than the competition?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Hey, Steve. It's Tim. It's all based on contracts and the negotiation around those contracts as we go through the implementation. So, for us, it's kind of a normal type of implementation across the mix of business that we have. And if you remember going back to the second quarter, we actually were able to accelerate part of that realization at the end of the second quarter and then I think the third quarter followed right as we would have expected it to.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks for that, Tim. And then also on containerboard but this time in Europe, the operating profit is a little bit disappointing. And I know that part of that is due to the Madrid start-up and that will be ultimately part of the solution. But is the margin differential between Europe and North America also somewhat attributable to like your transfer pricing of the board that you shipped from North America across the pond?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","I'll take the transfer pricing question. Mark probably wants to comment on the margins in Europe. We transfer at markets, so we are in the open market. We are shipping board to our integrated business. And everything we do, whether it's here in North America or other parts of the world, we're always attempting to be right on top of a market price as we think about how we sell to our integrated businesses.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","And Steve, this is Mark. On the plan we have for Europe, we see the combination of the competitive Southern European focused box business with the integration of our high-performance Madrid mill and the integration of the U.S. kraftliner into our Kraftliner segment. As Tim said, the profit for that shows up in the U.S. business.","We see our business being able to get to competitive European EBITDA margins. Now, remember, there's always going to be a gap in EBITDA margins. In a North American context, you got a lot more capital employed with virgin mills than you do in Europe. So, working toward a cost of capital return, you get there with lower EBITDA margins in Europe than you would in a higher CapEx environment that you have in North America. But in North America, you generate your own energy, you have a different cost structure, so you trade capital for operating cost, and the goal is to create value by getting well above our cost of capital in both business models.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","That's good color. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Adam Josephson, KeyBanc.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mark, I'm just \u2013 my first question on your demand; Europe, a healthy 1.5% in the quarter. Did you see anything \u2013 have you seen anything much different in October and were you at all surprised by the slowdown in the rate of industry growth as the quarter progressed?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. In our quarter \u2013 hey, Adam. It's Tim.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","In our quarter, we felt very good about; it was very strong and we see it continuing into October into the fourth quarter. So, we only know what we see in terms of the segments that we're exposed to and the customer mix that we have. And as I've pointed out in the comments, we think we have the best customers across all of our segments but especially within these faster-growing segments very well-positioned. So, right now as we're in October, it feels like our third quarter momentum has continued.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Tim. And Mark, just one question on vertical integration. I think you addressed this on the last call because there was a capacity addition announced on the day of your 2Q call and the question of vertical integration came up. The open market is supposed to be pretty small. But obviously, we've seen four capacity announcements in recent months from nonintegrated producers and the obvious question is where is all that paper going to go? What are your thoughts about that issue and why the limited open market has not prevented this number of capacity announcements of late, appreciating that we don't know for sure that they'll all come on but assuming they will.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","It's a great question, Adam, and I think your last qualification is a valid one. We don't really know how all of the capacity will play out. But as I said in my remarks, what really matters is the actual packaging solution, the box and the supply chain services you provide for customers. So being an open market provider of one or two grades of containerboard, you might find a place in that value chain and you might not. And I think the last time, in the 2015-2016 period where some capacity was added by different types of industry participants including nonintegrated, we saw a wide range of outcomes, from complete failure to being acquired by a vertically-integrated company and everything in between. And I think we're probably going to see some of that here as well.","The way I look at it though, Adam, the big picture is containerboard globally is growing. And the virgin containerboard that's made competitively in the U.S. primarily is going to feed a lot of the fiber need. There are some dislocations right now, but I think we're going to see that mass balance of fiber to where packaging is made settle out over time because the corrugated box is a really good packaging solution for so many different segments, so I think that's what's going to happen.","I said that and others said that in our company when we met with investors a few years ago, it sort of turned out that way. So, I guess we will have to see how things transpire over the next couple of years but I feel really confident about the supply chain, the value of integration because it's what addresses the customers' need.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks a lot, Mark.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Gabe Hajde, Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, congratulations on a strong quarter. Question on inventories and where you sit today and we've heard a lot about increased distribution costs and such, and it doesn't look like that's going away anytime soon. Just how you feel about inventories in your system and highoperating rates as we look at industry data, how that might persist through the fourth quarter?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Hey, Gabe, it's Tim. We feel better about our inventory levels now than we have in a long time just based on a string of events, whether it was natural disasters or specific issues that impacted our mills. We spent most of last year and much of this year really working our supply chain hard to get back to more sustainable levels of inventory at a time when you had all of the transportation issues \u2013 first, rail; and then truck and so it's been timing to get product where it needs to go, but it's also been sourcing the right kind of transportation at the right time. So, I would say, across our channels, we've been chasing to catch up on orders especially in the export markets and also working hard to get back to a sustainable footing on inventory levels and I feel like we're just now beginning to get there.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning, Mark and Tim. If you could just clarify the year for the CapEx number, the $1.6 billion, and then my main question is the \u2013 if you look at industry data, obviously, we've seen a surge of export activity in the last quarter. I think September was the highest for any quarter or any month on record. And I just wanted \u2013 it would be one thing if we were seeing a soft economy and you guys weren't running your mills to the max. But looking at the operating rates, it would seem to suggest that there was actually a desire to get board out there, and I just didn't know if you could help us understand what's causing the export market to be so attractive to make such a stretch to supply it?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Well, I think you've seen -good morning, Chip, it's Tim again. I think you've seen the price realizations over a period of time. The demand has been and continues to be very strong across all of the geographies that we serve and we've always thought of export as something as a strategic channel to market for us especially with a core group of customers.","Part of what we've been doing, as I referenced in the response to the last question, is just catching up on orders as backlogs had extended out in time. So we saw healthy demand in the quarter. We continue to see healthy demand. I think that continues as we exit 2018 and go into next year. And it's been that way for several years in a row now, so this is not something that's new. The demand has been there consistently.","On the capital spending, it's really timing. We're a little bit lower last year than what we had guided to and part of that has spilled over into this year and so we're thinking that it's right around $1.6 billion in 2018 after being $1.4 billion last year.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, this is my follow-up. Could you talk a little bit about maybe what CapEx will be next year? And in the context of that, if you think about it, the after-tax dividend yield, at least last night, was over 5%. And I know your after-tax borrowing costs are well below that. So, just any thoughts about how that impacts what you were saying about buybacks?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. I think \u2013 I don't want to try to forecast for people about what we will do. I think we've laid the framework out and we see the same numbers that you see. And so I think the approach that we're taking is we're reporting after the fact what we've done in the quarter and let those actions speak for themselves over time.","And the other part of your question about 2019, we're still working through the numbers. It will be lower but we don't have a number that has been finalized at this point. We normally put that out at the end of the fourth quarter when we release in January.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. So, despite the Riverdale project, it will be lower. Thanks. That's very helpful.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody, thanks for taking the question and for the details. I want to take two questions \u2013 one from a packaging standpoint then I want to drill back into dividends and cash flow in a minute. Obviously, you showed better-than-industry growth this quarter and I guess that'd be one way to measure it but could you provide some sort of quantification or a qualitative view on how you're trying to distance your packaging business versus others?","And the reason I asked \u2013 I mean to the earlier question about paper capacity coming in and the merchant channel being constrained because of all the buyouts that have occurred? In theory, somebody could also start opening up box plants and then you'd have more independent capacity available as well, so how do you quantify or how do you create a moat around your box business and grow that share versus peers from a performance standpoint?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","George, this is Mark, good morning. That's a great question and it's sort of embedded in those words we used in our prepared remarks. But when you think about all the different types of segments that go into the corrugated packaging market and what different customers need, we have the ability, starting with the base material of containerboard, to design the exact right package uniquely for that customer's need. And, in some cases, that's combining three or four different types of grades into a final package. And we control the making of those grades and the quality that goes into that. You can trade off specs on the inside of the box versus the outside. And all of those types of things are what we bring to the customer.","In other cases, customers want additional services beyond just the physical package. They want supply chain services, maybe some fulfillment services. In some cases, our smaller customers want help inside of their plants with health and safety and reliability. So when we go to market, we study every customer \u2013 what we can offer, what their needs are and we look for where there's a match and where there's an unserved need, and then we go out and we prepare something that really is compelling for our customers.","So when Tim talked about the high-growth segments and the customers within those segments, there is a lot of analytical work that goes on in that process of us targeting the segments that we believe will be here in the future and the customers within those segments. And so it's not just the physical box. It's a lot of what we call value-added services for our customers that we hope make our relationship with those customers pretty sticky.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for that Mark. And as an aside, I mean do you feel you still have more opportunity to get paid for the additional service components or you feel like you're getting fair value for that?","And then, my other question to the dividend and recognizing your commentary today suggest you're comfortable in your outlook and the momentum into 2019 and, yeah, the stock is up today. But when the stock is at $40 a share, the dividend yield is 5% and that is typically a level where people are really beginning to worry about the macro outlook going forward. Not that you're preparing for this but could you remind us how quickly and, to what degree, could you reduce CapEx if you needed to if there was something on the horizon that we're not all seeing yet and why and what issues you may have in securing the dividend through the cycle? Thank you, guys, and good luck in the quarter.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Thanks, George, this is Tim. Just on the capital, I mean go back and look at what we've done in prior periods. All the years are different. Circumstances are different. But I think we've demonstrated, over time, a level of flexibility where we can manage capital in the moment if we absolutely have to.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","George, I would add on that though. The context to your question is about how do you operate, what's your flexibility in a differing economic environment, a downturn or something like that. It's more than just capital though. We've got a cost structure that has a high component of variable cost that we can adjust based on demand, and you've seen us do that in the past. And we've worked very hard to make our marginal economics model for how we buy every input and how we schedule machines and what we make. And when we make less...","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","...the majority of our costs are variable. They go away.","And so, we've got the ability to manage our cash flow which is what I meant when I said we are well-positioned to deal and thrive through almost any set of conditions that are out there, especially on a relative basis. And part of that is just the scale of the company and the ability for us to be able to make decisions in high-demand periods, in medium-demand periods, and in low-demand periods. So, we feel good about that flexibility beyond just the ability to temporarily cut capital. It's much more than that.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the context. Thank you, guys. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Debbie Jones, Deutsche Bank.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, two questions. One, I jumped in late, so I wasn't sure if you mentioned October volumes to-date. And then if you could just comment on any the kind of regional differences that you're seeing East or West Coast related to Ag or whatnot?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Hey, Debbie, it's Tim. Yeah, we did cover it a little \u2013 a few minutes ago. But the synopsis was that we had a strong quarter in the third quarter. We've actually outperformed market all year long based on a lot of the factors that we talked about in the commentary, and we see that momentum continuing in October as we've gone through the month. So, I think you could look at third quarter and see the similar type of result so far.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, sorry about the repeat. But my second...","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","No problem.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","... question, you have touched on this as well, but just kind of broadly speaking, I actually think it \u2013 it's actually not that surprising that you're seeing a lot of international players looking to build capacity in North America just given the increasing environmental restraints, higher cost of production that you're seeing with wage increases and things like that. And I'm just wondering if you think about getting more involved in kind of taking control of the supply that's going offshore, what you would need to feel more comfortable about that, because I think a lot of the concern for investors is just who's adding the capacity and kind of not really understanding what they might do with it.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So, Debbie, that's a great question. I think there's all types of companies that have announced intentions to make some containerboard. I think the fundamental issue that I always come back to and we come back to in International Paper is that the global fiber trade is a global business. And virgin fiber primarily \u2013 but not only \u2013 but primarily out of the U.S., some in Latin America and some in, let's say, Russia and Northern Europe, is the feedstock for the global packaging business.","The markets are growing more in parts of the world that use recycled fiber as we all know. Recycled fiber, depending on where it comes from originally, was new fiber to begin with. So it's not two separate universes. And so it would be expected as the global packaging market grows, to see possibly more fiber being generated out of the competitive markets. So if OCC was working before but now it's not because of environmental concerns, then taking that fiber one step earlier in the process, cleaning it up and making it recycled pulp or something, and then feeding the box market is another business model.","Is it cost competitive? I think that's the way markets are designed. We'll have to see. But if there's no other option because of environmental concerns then it becomes the standard. So it's about moving fiber to the places where packaging demand is growing. And I think that's what we're seeing playing out and we're a major participant in that. We've generated very strong margins many times, best-in-class margins as a longtime participant in these global fiber markets when, in some cases, they're not quite as attractive as our domestic box business, but over time, you can see that we've built this channel strategy that's developed into a very strong global competitor.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you for that. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde, BMO.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hi, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I've got a couple of questions. First, I understand that Amazon is starting to make some changes in the requirements for packaging from some of their customers beginning in 2019. I think this is more on some of the heavier weight products that they move. Could you just talk about that and talk about the implications for IP?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. I don't think we want to talk about customer-specific items, Mark, to be honest.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Well, it sounds like this affects like maybe 1,000 vendors in the Amazon and sort of what they're going to have to provide in terms of packaging. So I think just as \u2013 for the market as a whole, it's a fairly large potential issue.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. And we work closely with all of our customers. And I just \u2013 I think on principle, it's better if they speak for themselves and we don't try to. So we're very close with a lot of our customers, all of our customers in e-commerce. We understand the trends. We're working closely with them.","I think the key there is that because we are viewed as a leader in the space, they seek our involvement and input. And so we feel like we are on the front-end of a lot of the innovations and changes that come about and I would just leave it at that.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And Mark, just coming back to kind of Debbie's question, I'm just kind of curious. If you think about the cost of making paperboard packaging; next to fiber, energy is usually the second biggest variable cost, so I'm just trying to understand longer-term how you think it makes sense or if you think it makes sense, to basically be passing fiber for recycled packaging through two energy cycles? You got to produce the recycled fiber here in the U.S. and dry it. And then presumably, you're sending it offshore to be rewetted and turned into paperboard and then going through a second energy cycle. It just \u2013 it kind of puzzles me how long-term that makes good economic sense?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","I think it's a great observation, Mark, and it wouldn't seem to make great economic sense, but you always have to measure that value chain against the alternative. And if you have non-tariff and tariff barriers, so other costs that are not operating costs, that raise the cost of your alternatives, one being OCC, one being tariffs on finished products, then the economics change. Is it long-term sustainable? Maybe not, but you've got a burgeoning packaging market in a part of the world that's struggling to get fiber, so in order to survive and provide products for customers, you may do something that raises your costs for a while. And I just think if you look at what makes it economically viable, it's what are your alternatives and right now there are limited alternatives for moving fiber without that extra step of cleaning basically.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Just to kind of complete this thing, would you worry if you were in that kind of situation about just another change in government policy? Because it seems like this whole thing is really swinging around pretty widely on sort of government policy in Washington and government policy in China?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Would I worry? Absolutely. I think you have to stay heavily engaged in government policy. So, when you look at the type of investments being made in odd wood baskets and those kinds of things, I think is reflective of some uncertainty about, well, how long will I need this investment, is it going to be permanent, is it going to be for a while? I think we've got to see all of that play out, but back to what I said at the beginning, this fiber has to move to where the packaging has to be made for customers and it will. It will find a way to move and the economics are going to be driven by the absolute cost of manufacturing and the nonmanufacturing cost of government policy.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks, Mark. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question would come from the line of Anthony Pettinari, Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Regarding the Brazil Packaging decision, I'm wondering if there's a timeline for when that divestiture could be executed? Is there any read to your freesheet business in Brazil which, I guess, has historically been very profitable? And then understanding that the packaging business has kind of underperformed since you acquired it, what sort of ultimately drove the decision that it might be better off with a different owner?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Anthony, good morning. I think that there's no specific timeline because we're just starting the process but we will provide updates as we have relevant information. We're going to look at several options. There's some creative options with that kind of business in that type of market, but we will move at a deliberate pace and there's no read-through on the paper business. The paper business is structured entirely differently in our IP, whereas we talk about trying to build an advantaged position, which has multiple dimensions. We have that in our Brazil paper business with our own land and eucalyptus fiber, but also the cost structure and the ability to export probably the highest quality, uncoated freesheet business product all over the world.","The issue with the packaging business is it's a domestic business and it depends on GDP growth. And unfortunately for us, we bought the business that we knew was going to need some additional work but we bought it in the face of a deep, deep recession that I don't think anyone really anticipated.","So with negative growth to basically zero growth, we just haven't seen the growth we needed to get the momentum to be able to be competitive in that business. The box plant part of the business is very good. Our mill system needs work and we've chosen to deploy our cash in other places that have a much higher return versus in that Brazilian mill system.","And had we had 4% growth \u2013 3%, 4% growth, we might be in a different spot. But we've had now three, almost four years of a contracted economy which has greatly affected the box businesses. The business models that have worked in that part of the world are really similar to the business model we had here, which is an integrated business model for the local market and a very competitive export product for the rest of the world.","We don't need that. We have all the export capacity we need out of the best place to make it, which is the U.S., so we're not trying to replicate that business model. And that's what led us to the decision, is that we have better uses for the cash and the depth of the recession in the local economy has just been more persistent than we had anticipated.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just following up on Mark's question, you sell pulp into China. You have a lot of global consumer and industrial customers. I'm just wondering what impact you're seeing from these U.S. China tariffs? It seems like, year-to-date, the impact has been limited but at least from some of the recent calls, it also seems like something that more companies are flagging and increasingly concerned about. I'm just wondering what you're seeing for IP and hearing from your customers?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","It has been limited. We keep a very close eye on it. We're working our own channels of policy lobbying. The issue for us is that the type of products we sell, whether it's through our Global Cellulose Fibers business or even our Ilim joint venture, our products that the market really needs and it's even with a potential tariff is still the best option for the local producers.","So, unlike some of the people who have been flagging their supply chain with mechanical parts and other things that have reasonable alternatives with just a little bit of work, this is a natural resource business that the alternatives are known and we have real competitive positions for the type of products like the absorbent pulp or the softwood tissue and fiber that we sell out of our joint venture with Ilim, that really is the best solution for those markets. So we are watching it very closely but that's really the reason for the limited impact.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Very helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask on the Printing Papers business. I thought they were great results in the quarter and I think relative to your sort of guidance you laid out, they were also quite a bit better. I'm just wondering if you could talk about what drove the upside to your expectations there and how much of that you view as sustainable versus anything that might be a little bit more transitory?","And then just sort of tied to that, any concern that the stronger dollar might encourage some more imports like we have seen in the past.","And just a last kind of tying it into the Papers business, last question, any thoughts on the timing of the conversion to white top kraftliner, any thoughts on \u2013 given the current economics, delaying that or pushing that out a little bit into the future? Thanks.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Hey, Brian, it's Tim. Yeah, I think you highlighted a great story in the quarter. Printing Papers, across all of our regions performed very well, and it's just like we've said, it was across most facets of the business.","Brazil had an exceptional quarter but even in North America and Europe, solid commercial and operational results. And I think that one of the aspects that's consistent across the regions is the ability for all of the businesses to sell more product closer to home where they can secure better margins.","In terms of Riverdale, we're still working through all of our detailed engineering and making progress. There is no update that we have in terms of timing but we're looking at how we do it optimally for our businesses involved \u2013 both white paper business and the Industrial Packaging business, so no change, no update at this time but we continue to work through all of our analysis.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then, just any color on imports you might \u2013 any change in what you're seeing there?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. We haven't seen anything so far, so hard to predict the future. But yeah, it's \u2013 we've had better opportunity, as I said, to sell more product closer to home and all of the regions. That includes North America, so we'll have to see how it plays out based on currency and other factors over the next few quarters.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And just sticking on the topic of imports and exports, and shifting over maybe a little bit more towards the containerboard business, I'm just wondering if you're seeing any more competition in some of these export markets from other players, either existing guys or folks who are seeing a little bit more weakness in their domestic market and looking to move some stuff offshore. And tied to that, is the 4Q outlook that you laid out, does that include some slippage in export prices that were sort of picking up related to the tariffs and the currency shifts that we're seeing?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. I mean I wouldn't comment on price going forward. I think we laid out our expectations on the outlook, which would include also the export market. But we \u2013 I mean, we've continued to see extremely strong demand across regions. I think in a seasonally low period, it's normal to see some spot business that pops up in different parts of the world. That's the way I would characterize it and we'll see what happens as the season starts picking up now that we're in the fourth quarter in different regions of the world.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mark Weintraub, Seaport Global.","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC","Thank you. I wanted to just revisit a little bit some of the comments you made on pension. Obviously, there's been a huge use of cash, the contributions during the last 10 to 15 years, and it sounded like you are \u2013 of the view, there's going to be little or no contributions at least for the foreseeable future. I wanted just to understand your confidence level in that and how much you are systematically protected at this stage versus if interest rates move one way or another, the situation changes.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. It's a great question, Mark, this is Tim. So, I just want to tell you we were always partially hedged on interest rates. And based on the improved funding level that we saw near the end of the quarter, we did increase that partial hedge to a higher amount. We can disclose all of that when we come back and re-measure in our, I guess, it'd be in our fourth quarter call at the end of January, but we felt pretty good coming out of the third quarter. The pension risk transfer, we thought was a very good move for us to make. And based on the improved funding level that we were experiencing at the end of the third quarter, that gave us the confidence to also make the shift on our asset allocation to increase the fixed income exposure and take down equities.","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC","And so, at this point, is it \u2013 do you feel that you are, under most scenarios, pretty well-protected or is it \u2013 again, is it kind of dependent on how things play out in various markets?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","No, I think we feel like we've reduced risk greatly and that we're well-protected. And, of course, when we re-measure and we put out our annual number, we can share more details about that but I think we feel pretty good right now.","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC","Okay. Great. And just to follow up, just to make sure I'm kind of understanding the thought process on share repurchase. On the one hand, you've described a systematic approach. And then you also suggested it would be consistent cadence based on value. And so, I guess \u2013 I think, systematic, that sort of typically wouldn't include too much of a waiting to where the stock might be trading at any given point in time. And yet that other comment of consistent cadence based on value, I guess, made me think that actually you are going to be fairly conscious of where the stock might be trading as you make these decisions. How should I be bringing those two comments together?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah, it's a good question, Mark. And I think what we've said is we want to try to do both. We have not always purchased shares in a very consistent fashion over time. It's been very episodic, both in terms of timing and in terms of amount. And I think what we were talking about was systematic as we're going to be thoughtful about how we look at share repurchases versus other options for capital allocation. But we also always want to keep in mind our view of intrinsic value and buy below that. So, yeah, it's \u2013 will it always line up? I'm not sure. But we want to have a posture where we, on a more regular basis, are in the market buying our shares where we see value.","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Gaffner, Barclays Capital.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Mark; good morning, Tim. Tim, just going back to the dividend policy for a minute, I just want to clarify. Because if I look at the dividend rate, it was about 40% \u2013 a little bit over 40% of the free cash flow last year, probably a similar amount this year with the growth in the business. Are we looking at 40% to 50% of the mid-cycle free cash flow generation? Is that how we're thinking about the dividend policy on a go-forward basis?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. We've pressure-tested it under a lot of different scenarios. But even under trough scenarios what we're saying is we're committed to 40%, 50% of free cash flow on an ongoing basis. We want it to be sustainable. We think, given our view of normalized and trough margin levels and cash flow, that we can return the current dividend at the $2 per share under most scenario \u2013 most all scenarios, trough-tested and as well as normalized. So it's a view of returning free cash flow under any circumstance except maybe something like we experienced in 2008, but we view it as sustainable throughout the cycle, up and down.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. I hope nobody's planning for that type of recession again.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","So do I.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","When we look at the EBITDA margins in the North American Industrial Packaging business, they have expanded quite significantly this year. I think you said almost 24% in the quarter. I mean how do you think about the sustainability of those margins on a go-forward basis because you did kind of get the added benefit of a price increase early in the year and then as we talked about before, the OCC price dropping. So just how do you view the sustainability of those margins?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Well, if you look at our history, I think we've been within a fairly tight range through a lot of different macro factors. If you go back to 2015 and 2016, we were still in the 22% range. So I think, over the past five, six, seven years, we've demonstrated, within a band, our ability to manage our margins by the way we choose to participate in the various channels that we operate in as well as the investments that we've made in our facilities, the lower costs and improve supply chain capability. You're not immune from the market. But I think Mark alluded to it earlier and talked about our ability to manage through different types of circumstances given our size and our capability, I totally agree with that.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So, Scott, I'll just add to Tim's comment. I think you'll see \u2013 if you go back and look at recent history, you'll see our strongest margins tend to occur when the economy is the strongest, which also tends to be, at the same time, some of our cost \u2013 input costs are up and have pressure. And then if you put all that together, there's a huge leverage on the demand side of the equation. So at a 2.9% or 3% GDP economy in North America, we have a business that's capable of generating in the margin range of 24%, in the mid-20s. When we have less than 1%, which we had just a couple \u2013 a few years ago, we had about 22% margins.","And it follows logic in a way based on the price-cost relationship and what's happening in our customers' lives. When they're moving their product, we're there to serve for them, we have the flexible capacity, our margins tend to be a little higher. When the economy is slower, they tend to be a little lower.","But from a result standpoint, we had strong results at 22% from a return basis and stronger results at 24%. But you also have the ability to look at the high and the low being a relatively narrow band now versus a long time ago where there was a huge swing in margins based on economic outlook. So, that's why we feel confident about in the company we built, and in particular, this part of the company that we've built.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Mark; and thanks, Tim, congrats on a strong quarter despite some headwinds.","Operator","And our final question for today comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","... of your white paper tonnages outside of North America. Can you talk about how different the demand trends in those markets look to you from your vantage point?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Hi, Mark. It's Tim, could you repeat that? I'm sorry we missed the first part of your question. It cut out.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Sorry. I'm just thinking about how much of your white paper business is outside the U.S. It's a heck of a lot and so I'm just curious. We tend to focus too much on what the U.S. market is doing. I wonder if you could just share with us your sort of global view of your different white paper markets and their outlooks.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. It varies region by region. Latin America has been very good for us. Brazil has been up and down as you might expect from the economic performance in the country. Russia has been very stable and solid. We've actually not been able to meet all of the demand that we had in Western and the Eastern Europe because of the fire that we had earlier in the year at Kwidzyn and the amount of capacity that we lost.","So, yeah, I mean, it's \u2013 there are secular trends everywhere to varying degrees, but there's also differences in usage that make some regions less susceptible, we think, over time to the types of secular decline that we've experienced here in North America. The usage here, on a per capita basis as you know, Mark, was extremely high in North America. The rest of the world never had those type of per capita use numbers. And so we see stable demand across most of the other regions that we operate in.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, that's super helpful. And as long as we're on the topic of Russia, you've talked in the past about wanting to potentially expand your position in Ilim or certainly seeing Ilim itself expand. Are there any updates on capacity expansion or growth plans at Ilim?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Good, morning Mark, this is Mark. We have a tremendous business over there and really good business partners and we've said we'd like to continue to do more with Ilim because of its competitive position and we are pursuing as was previously discussed, Ilim's capital plan \u2013 normal capital plan to expand our softwood pulp capacity.","We also have a competitive kraftliner business there that's perfectly suited to serve certain specific needs in Asia, a narrower grade range but an important grade range, and so it's a good business. There's obviously a geopolitical component to it but on the ground with our employees, with our respective governments, the business has really never operated better and it's got more growth potential.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Guillermo Gutierrez for closing comments.","Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.","Thank you again for joining our third quarter earnings call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now the transfer this call over to your host, Jay Royalty, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ","Jay Royalty","Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining International Paper's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide two of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the Fourth Quarter and 2014 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly relative to the Ilim JV, slide four provides context around the joint ventures, financial information and statistical measures. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. ","Mark Sutton","Thank you, Jay and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. What I would like to do is quickly go over the format that we\u2019ll follow this morning. In the beginning, I\u2019ll review our Full Year 2014 results, and then turn it over to Carol Roberts to speak to the fourth quarter and the performances of our individual businesses. And then we\u2019ll come back and cover the first quarter and 2015 outlook before opening it up to questions. ","So I am on slide five looking at 2014 full-year results. International Paper completed a strong year in 2014. We delivered record cash flow from operations of $3.4 billion along with free cash flow of $2.1 billion. North American Industrial Packaging results were significant with the business achieving $2.7 billion in EBITDA and margins of 24%. Return on Invested Capital was 9.2% making this the fifth consecutive year that our returns have exceeded our cost of capital. And additionally we saw margin expansion across all of our key businesses in 2014. We conducted a successful debt restructuring program in which we pushed out a billion dollars of debt from 2018 and 2019. ","And we achieved more than $40 million in annualized interest savings as a result. In the fall, we increased our dividend by 14% to $1.60 per share, which was the third year in a row of double-digit dividend increases. For the year we bought back roughly $1 billion of IP stocks at a little over $47 a share. We completed the closure of the Courtland Alabama printing papers mill, which, as we\u2019ve mentioned was very difficult for us to do, especially with the impact on our employees. But we believe, it was necessary given the ongoing decline in North American uncoated free sheet demands. ","We completed the spinoff of our North American Distribution business xpedx and received $400 million as it became part of the new publicly traded company Veritiv. And the Russian JV, Ilim, which we own 50% had a solid year improving operational EBITDA by a 126% to $470 million for the full year. And we received a dividend of $56 million in 2014 from Ilim. Turning to the full-year financial results, IP achieved solid improvement across the board. Full year earnings-per-share finished at $3 per share and included in this figure is $0.63 of Ilim FX negative impact. Absent this impact our EPS was up 20% year-over-year and we\u2019ll talk more about that in a minute. ","Turning to slide seven, which is a history of our Return on Invested Capital. As I mentioned for 2014 our return was 9.2%, again the fifth year in a row that we're above cost of capital. We continue to deliver on our commitment to create value for our shareholders. I\u2019d also note that if you consider the impact to the equity earnings of the Ilim FX charge I mentioned earlier, which was a non-cash charge, our ROIC would have been over 10% for 2014 and that would have been a best ever mark for the company. ","Turning to slide eight, 2014\u2019s free cash flow of $2.1 billion continued a strong trend of free cash flow results since 2008. Beyond strong earnings from the businesses, our cash flow performance in 2014 benefited from strong working capital management in the fourth quarter. As we look to 2015 and beyond, we remain confident that IP can continue to deliver strong free cash flow in the years ahead. And turning to the uses of that cash, we continue to do what we said we would do. In total, we returned $1.6 billion or more than 75% of our free cash flow to shareholders throughout 2014. And additionally, we finished the year with a cash balance of $1.9 billion. ","And with that overview of the full year, I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol and then I'll return later to talk about the outlook and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Carol? ","Carol Roberts","Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. Turning to slide ten, looking at the year-over-year bridge for 2014, you can see year-over-year price improvement was significant at $0.89 with about 60% of this coming from our North American Industrial Packaging business, 30% from Printing Papers and the balance came from our Consumer Packaging segment. In aggregate volume was down and this was mostly due to the volume decline in North American Printing Papers as Mark said largely driven by the Courtland mill shutdown. Overall our operations performed well for the year. Looking at input costs, they were a $141 million higher due to the stubbornly and consistently high wood costs that we saw throughout the year. ","Energy costs were higher as well, largely driven by the very low levels that we saw in 2013 and also impacted by the significant weather that we experienced in the first quarter of 14, and the lingering impact that, that had on energy costs through the first half of the year. These were partially offset by lower chemical costs. Taxes were higher in 2014 by about 5% and that was due to fewer tax benefits in 14 versus what we experienced in 2013. And finally we had a significant non-cash Ilim FX hit in 2014 as Mark pointed out of $0.63 per share. But most importantly we saw a substantial improvement in the business, in the operations as you can see in the call-out box. ","And this is attributable to the continued post project ramp up as well other efficiency improvements and margin expansion that resulted in operational EBITDA more than doubling from the prior year. So as Mark stated when you exclude the Ilim non-cash FX charge we enjoyed an EPS improvement of more than 20% in 2014. Turning to the results for the fourth quarter, as Mark said IP delivered record free cash flow for the year and it was no different in the quarter with $739 million of free cash flow. And this came from solid performance across all our key businesses, as well as strong working capital management in the quarter. ","We benefited from stronger North American Box demand, but this was muted by weaker global conditions in a number of our segments. We did see some benefit from lower input costs in the quarter and operating results at the Ilim JV were strong. Although as we said the JV did experience a large non-cash FX charge of $0.40 in the quarter itself, and this reduced our fourth-quarter EPS to $0.53 per share. Additionally, we repurchased a 170 million of our shares in the fourth quarter bringing the total purchases since September of 2013 to $1.44 billion. ","Moving to slide twelve, taking a look at the quarter-over-quarter bridge I\u2019ll highlight a few key items. On volume, results were better for the quarter as the North American Box volume exceeded our expectations on stronger daily demand. Operations and cost were unfavorable quarter-over-quarter largely due to some isolated issues at a few of our mills in the US. The issue we had at our mill in France and an issue we had at one of our mills in Brazil. Additionally the fourth quarter is typically a more expensive operating quarter due to the onset of colder weather and some other seasonal costs that we see. Transportation rates across all our North American businesses were higher due to tight rail and truck markets. And year end true-up expenses were higher in the quarter as well. ","Regarding corporate expenses there was a non-cash FX charge for the administrative restructuring of an international entity for which we took a one-time hit. As I said Ilim operational results improved in the quarter while we also experienced the large negative non-cash FX charge associated with JV US denominated debt. As I mentioned on the prior slide, EPS for the quarter would have been $0.40 higher in the absence of this non-cash FX impact. ","So turning to Industrial Packaging on slide thirteen, despite three fewer shipping days in the quarter volume was flat as the daily rate for box demand was at its strongest level of the year. Pricing and aggregate was down slightly, primarily driven by pressure on exports due to seasonality and a weaker euro. Operations were unfavorable for the quarter primarily driven by isolated issues at our Orange, Texas and Newport, Indiana mills. And as I mentioned transportation costs were higher as well as truck and rail rates increased due to pretty -- a very tight market condition. We also experienced higher benefit costs and other expenses due to some year-end true ups, and we had several one-off expenses that at our Brazil Packaging business. ","Maintenance outage expenses were higher as well, but we had clearly expected that. And then finally on input costs, they were modestly lower as we saw lower expenses for energy, OCC and diesel that were offset by some higher utility costs. And we had a major event at the steam provider for our Newport, Indiana mill that resulted in our need to pay some premium pricing for energy to sustain mill operations throughout the quarter. ","I think slide fourteen is just a great picture which shows the track record of results that we've been able to achieve in our North American Industrial Packaging business for the last ten years. In 2014 the business achieved $2.7 billion in EBITDA, 24% margins. We're very proud of this business and of all of our colleagues in the Industrial Packaging business, and the job they have done to achieve, sustain, and build on these industry-leading results. And this has really been done through delivering real value to our customers, great operating performance and quite honestly a commitment to excellence and to continue to improve. ","Moving to Consumer Packaging, seasonally lower demand in solid operating performance and a desire to manage our inventories very closely resulted in the need for some market-related downtime in the quarter to match production to our customers\u2019 demand. Results were also impacted by higher maintenance outage expenses and some unfavorable FX impact in our European and China business. The business did see some benefit from lower input costs for wood, energy and fuel. ","Moving on to Printing Papers on slide sixteen, volume was seasonally stronger in Brazil and Russia. Pricing and mix were slightly unfavorable for the quarter as less favorable pulp mix and pricing pressure in Europe were partially offset by a seasonally stronger mix in Brazil. Maintenance outages were higher as expected and operations were unfavorable due to higher operating expenses in North American papers, and higher costs associated with reliability issues at our Mogi Gua\u00e7u mill in Brazil and our Saillat mill in France. Higher year-end benefit costs in Brazil impacted our results as well. And once again as in the other businesses input costs were favorable on our Paper segment. ","Slide seventeen kind of highlights IP\u2019s year-over-year change in operating profits by region for the Printing Papers business. In North America Printing Papers improved by $2 million which you have to point out is significant when you consider the $40 million charge of additional expenses that we incurred in 2014 related to the Courtland closure. The North American Pulp business had a good year with improved earnings of $55 million driven by higher volume, improved operations and improved pricing and mix associated with a higher percentage of Fluff Pulp. ","Brazil was flat, really not surprising given the economic headwinds we\u2019ve experienced there. And Europe was down $27 million on less favorable pricing and mix, higher input costs partially offset by lower outage expenses. Earnings in India improved $10 million year-over-year driven by improved pricing and lower operational and maintenance outage expenses. ","Now turning to the Ilim JV on slide eighteen, a good quarter of operating and margin performance which was offset by the large non-cash FX charge related to the JV\u2019s US dollar-denominated debt. Volume was up 12% for the quarter, operational EBITDA increased to a $143 million. When looking at the full-year results, volume was up 19% to almost 3.2 million tons. Operational EBITDA improved from $208 million in 2013 to $470 million in 2014. These improvements were largely attributable to the ramp-up of the major JV funded capital projects of both at the Koryazhma mill and the Bratsk mill as well as other efficiency improvements made by the Ilim team. ","Due to the significant devaluation of the ruble, which we saw late in the fourth quarter, the JV expects to see further margin expansion in the first quarter. And again simply put, most of our costs, 95% of our costs are in rubles, and 65% of our sales are in dollars, which gives us this opportunity for margin expansion. It is worth noting that with that devaluation of the currency, we will see rising inflation in 2015 and that also has a potential to create some pressure on pulp pricing. So it will be very important for the team at Ilim to closely manage operations and costs as they go into 2015. ","As we step back and look at the many reasons we like our investment in Ilim, our partnership with Ilim at the top of the list is how the JV is so well positioned to serve the most significant and fastest growing pulp market in the world, China. The JV\u2019s pulp operations in Siberia are uniquely located with favorable access to the vast Russian wood basket and importantly with access to mainland China by rail, a straight south from where the mill sits. The JV will benefit from the recent significant devaluation in the ruble which has positioned the softwood pulp operation as the lowest cost on the globe. And there's more potential as we continue to improve the operational performance of the business. ","So before I turn to the outlook I\u2019d like to give you an update on our balance sheet. And some of the impacts that we've had are due to the lower discount rates along with a change to mortality tables that came about last year and that we\u2019ve implemented into our liability accounting. We did see our pension gap grow to $3.9 billion as of the end of 2014. In the year we made roughly a $350 million in required pension contributions. And this contribution looks to be maybe about a $100 million in 2015, not yet totally decided but certainly much less than what we had previously anticipated. ","As you recall, we executed a significant bond issue and tender offer that Mark mentioned this year that enabled us to move out about a billion dollars of debt from 18 and 19 which were our largest towers along with realizing roughly a $40 million annualized interest saving. And we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.9 billion. ","So on twenty one, turning to the outlook for the first quarter. Volume will be largely flat across most of our businesses with the exception of Russia and Brazil, where there is a normal seasonal decrease. The seasonal decrease in Brazil is coming off of the strongest quarter of the year, which is the fourth quarter. And this typically will result in about a third less volume for Brazil domestically, so about a $30 million negative swing quarter-over-quarter. We expect pricing to be fairly stable across most geographies with the exception of Europe, where pressure continues in the paper side due to continued economic challenges. ","We expect improved operating performance in North American Industrial Packaging as the isolated issues we experienced in the fourth quarter are behind us. And we have a similar expectation for improved performance at our Mogi Gua\u00e7u mill in Brazil as well as the Saillat mill in France. We do expect some modest offsets from North American Consumer Package as operation and costs move back to a more typical first-quarter level. Input costs should trend favorably due to lower energy and fuel costs, but we are seeing some offset of that due to increasing transportation rates, due to the tight conditions both in the rail and the truck markets. ","And energy consumption in North America will be higher as well due to the normal winter condition. Maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase in the quarter, $14 million. We assume operations at the Ilim JV will continue to perform favorably and as usual we are not attempting to forecast the ruble. The assumption of flat FX coming out of the fourth quarter would result in a $0.40 positive swing for the first quarter. But based upon what we're seeing to date, there's likely some additional negative impact in the first quarter depending on how the ruble ends the quarter. ","And we expect the tax rate to increase modestly to 33% on higher US earnings in the absence of tax extenders which we saw in the fourth quarter of 14. And finally we expect corporate expense to return to the normalized rate of roughly $15 million in the quarter. So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark. ","Mark Sutton","Thank you, Carol. I am on slide twenty two now and what I would like to do is make a couple of comments about how we see 2015 as we enter the year. You know I\u2019d like to turn your attention to the slide, and it\u2019s a lot of information on the slide. Basically what we're trying to do here is take a look at growth rates, GDP rates in the regions that we operate comparing them, 15 to 14. And as you can see from the chart we see a few more headwinds and tailwinds. But a reminder, 80% plus of our EBITDA is generated in the US, and we see a stronger US market. So that really helps a lot in North America. ","This is the market that drives our results, and we saw in a number of businesses some improved demand environment as we exited 2014. In the markets that are most challenged as we enter 2015, Carol spoke about Russia and the challenges domestically in Russia. However, with our leverage as an exporter we think we can navigate that environment. We didn\u2019t talk a lot about Brazil, but Brazil is in a difficult position right now. Again our paper businesses in Brazil is well positioned to win in those markets. We provide product in Brazil, but also in the region. ","Our packaging business is mostly about Brazil and of course that will be more impacted, but we do see some improvement opportunities there. And the bottom line is we\u2019ve built a company that's got exposure in a number of markets. We're nimble, we're ready and able to deal with a variety of macro conditions that might occur in any given year and we will work very hard to offset headwinds in one area with hopefully tailwinds in another. As we turn to our expectations for 2015, we see continued progress and strong results despite the macro environment that I just described as remaining challenging. ","As we showed earlier in the presentation deck, we delivered consistently strong results in both ROIC and free cash flow for the last several years. And I believe we will do the same again in 2015. We see the opportunity to grow our EBITDA by roughly 5% by executing the plans we currently have in place for our key businesses. Along with this expected increase in EBITDA, free cash flow is likely to be impacted by things like higher cash taxes as a result of higher earnings from the US operations I talked about, also as a result of changing and lower tax credits and a few non-repeat deductible events. Relative to how we're thinking about CapEx, our target for 2015 is 1.5 billion. ","The intent is to continue to find a higher percentage of our high-return projects that will enable IP to continue to grow earnings, free cash flow and our returns. Some recent examples of these higher return projects are our foodservice expansion in Kenton, Ohio and the restart of our Valliant number three paper machine which we shared with you in a prior quarter. So thinking about the key leverage that will enable the EBITDA growth for 2015, here are a few I\u2019d like to highlight and I am on slide twenty four. We\u2019ve a great opportunity to continue to optimize the North American Industrial Packaging system with the ramp down of our DOJ required purchases from the mills that we divested as part of the Temple-Inland acquisition, and the restart of the Valliant machines. ","Those two events allow us to optimize our system even further and again we mentioned this before but I\u2019ll restate it. It\u2019s not about volume growth as much as it is about enhanced flexibility across a very large system which will enable us to serve the customer needs we\u2019ve at a lower total delivered cost. So we\u2019ve opportunities to grow kraft liner through our international box system. We\u2019ve talked about that in prior discussions. We still see opportunity there in specialty applications like paper that's required for gypsum board, which we also make in our containerboard system is growing and all of this flexibility allows us to bring the best revenue stream in through the asset base we\u2019ve. ","The Courtland shutdown and transition are complete and we\u2019ll realize the benefits of this repositioning for the North American Printing Papers business while the costs are largely behind us from 2014. There is a growing trend in demand for fiber-based food packaging that we see in the move from foam to paper cups as an example, and the growing plate segment, just to name a few. And we're well-positioned to benefit from these demand trends. And we expect to see solid improvement in results in our Brazil Industrial Packaging business. We're well-positioned to benefit from continued margin expansion that Carol outlined in our Ilim JV. ","So before we go to questions, I would just like to conclude by saying you know 2014 was a strong year for IP and a lot was accomplished. I feel good about how we performed and the momentum we\u2019ve going into 2015. We again delivered strong results and created value for our shareholders and that's our commitment. We're off to a good start in 2015. I am excited about the prospects for another strong year. We\u2019ve every opportunity to deliver on the outlook I just shared with you, and our team is engaged in committing to doing it. 2015 is all about execution and that's something we pride ourselves on really continuing to improve on. ","In addition, we intend to focus more resources on high-return capital projects within our core businesses that can drive additional earnings growth. And finally our team is committed to continue to find ways to deliver the most value for shareholders. And as such, we will continue to evaluate all of our businesses as well as our capital allocation strategy. We feel good about where we\u2019ve come from and what we've accomplished, but we're far from satisfied at this point. We expect to deliver more value in the future. And on that note, I'd like to give you a quick update on where we are with the Master Limited Partnership evaluation process. ","We continue to look and work diligently on this project with our tax, financial and legal advisors. And the real question is evaluating whether the MLP structure is the best vehicle to create value for IP and our shareholders. We continue to be interested in the opportunity. While we said before it\u2019s complicated, we haven\u2019t seen anything that would say that we need to shut down the analysis so that it\u2019s a no-go. By the same token, we haven't reached a conclusion either. But since our last call we\u2019ve filed a request with the IRS to get a private letter ruling and it remains a little unclear on how that might proceed, but we will stay tuned. ","Our primary goal is to create value for our shareholders and we're evaluating the MLP opportunity because it has the potential to be part of our value creation strategy. As we\u2019ve more information to share we will keep everyone informed. With that I think we're ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question is from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. ","George Staphos","A few questions. You know Mark, you know, you mentioned that or the company mentioned that you expect to grow EBITDA this year about 5%, and we wish you well in that regard. And you talked to some of the drivers of that performance on slide twenty four. Would it be possible to perhaps parse how much of that growth comes from those drivers when considering in 2014 you know looking at your slides, you didn't grow EBITDA quite 5%. And that was the year where you had much more pricing tailwinds and you're likely to have in 15 at least given current trends. So you know if you could talk to those points and I had a couple of quick follow-ons. ","Mark Sutton","Yeah I think the outline on slide twenty four are the key drivers. I mean part of it is as I mentioned in internal execution. We still don't have a robust volume outlook in our plan, but I think we've got the opportunities in the points I made on that slide that gives us a good chance to grow that EBITDA in really internal initiatives and some of the execution issues that we have in front of us. And there is a long list of high-return capital projects that improve our quality and lower our costs that we\u2019ve discovered in the number of businesses, most recently in our -- in North American Industrial Packaging business that we plan on working on. ","George Staphos","Okay, but other than that and general [indiscernible] we appreciate you might not want to get into the details at this juncture not willing to parse that any further on this call? ","Mark Sutton","I\u2019d rather not, thank you. ","George Staphos","No, I understand, I understand. Secondly on pension, I think you mentioned that funding is now a $100 million for 15 and we understand why, obviously with the growth and the pension gap. At this juncture, Carol is it possible to talk about what the implications are going forward past 15? So simplistically, should we extrapolate a 100 million into the future or you know could there be some offsets that we should consider as we model out? ","Carol Roberts","George, actually the honest truth of it is, is you really don't know your total cash required contributions until June, because there's some more that has to be done. And so as we sit, it\u2019s not really much of a change from where we were before. It\u2019s in that range, and it all comes back to -- and very close to your funding target attainment number and you are right around 100%. If you go a little below that, you\u2019ve to put a little bit more money in. If you are above it, you don\u2019t. So it\u2019s just that we're very close to that edge is why I qualify it with a 100. But there's no real change even with the growing gap in the liability. ","George Staphos","My last question and I\u2019ll turn it over. I noticed, I think from the slide deck that you are projecting maintenance spending to be up, I think around $60 million in 15 versus 14. Can you comment to what the drivers are there and you know how important is that in terms of the overall execution, you know imperative if you will in 15 in terms of how you get that 5% EBITDA growth? Thanks and good luck in the quarter. ","Carol Roberts","Yes, George this is Carol. I\u2019ll take that. Actually what\u2019s happening in 2015 and it will happen again in 2016, is there is some significant outages for the [indiscernible] implementation that requires some extra work. And so if you look at I think the numbers that are in there is $444 million of outage expense in 14 increasing to about 500. The biggest driver of that increase is the very specific work that has to go on around some of the mills that's more extensive than we normally would be see. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub, Buckingham Research. ","Mark Weintraub","Thank you, I had two questions. First I just wanted to know, are you continuing to see the strength in corrugated demand domestically as we go into January that you're seeing in the fourth quarter? And do you have any visibility as to how sustainable it is at that point? ","Mark Sutton","Hi, Mark. We're are seeing January starting off with a continuation of the trend we saw in November and December. So across a number of segments you know we're sort of in every segment given our scale, but we do see that continuing. I wish I could answer your second question, I would say we hope so. Some of it seems to be underpinned by the behavior of the American consumer and everything we read about with respect to the impact of lower fuel prices and you know consumer sentiment in general being better. But it\u2019s you know a couple of months, maybe not a trend yet but we are cautiously optimistic. ","Mark Weintraub","Thank you and then if I could try and just translate, if there is 5% growth in EBITDA, in terms of thinking about EPS is it fair for us to take this $3 and presumably, hopefully we don't have the Ilim FX issue, so we're really starting at $3.63. Then if we think about 5% is roughly 200 million, that's about another $0.30. I guess there's some movements in tax rate and interest expense and corporate, but is that kind of directionally the way to think about translating the EBITDA to an EPS number or are there other significant variables to be keeping in mind? ","Carol Roberts","No, Mark I think that's it. Of course you know we\u2019ve the Ilim FX issue, so that's in both, now it\u2019s in the 14, it will be something in 15. And you hit it, we gave some information on where we view the tax rate going and also the interest expense. So yes, you are directionally thinking about it correctly. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman, UBS. ","Gail Glazerman","You took another big charge in Asia this quarter and you took a big one in India, you know within the last year. I am just wondering, does that have any -- to what extent does that reflect on how you are viewing the business potential moving forward? And also how it may or may not impact your thinking in terms of further growth and investments in the region? ","Carol Roberts","Yes Gail, I\u2019ll just comment on the charge. So I think it\u2019s listed in our special charges. We did take the write-off of the goodwill that was associated with our Asian Box business, the converting business. And as you pointed out, we wrote off the goodwill associated with India in the prior year. And so relative to the comments about the business and the portfolio, I\u2019ll turn that over to Mark. ","Mark Sutton","Thanks Carol. Good morning, Gail. Now the charges are really as Carol described. Our view on the businesses, in any of these kind of emerging markets is, it\u2019s a long view. It\u2019s a difficult time in Asia right now for a number of reasons, namely capacity issues. You know we're very small in India and we still see some potential there. So I think we do have a long view on these markets, but as we said before, and I said in my earlier comments we will continue to evaluate as time goes on almost on a continuous basis. The portfolio we're in and geographies and businesses, all against the backdrop of trying to do the things that create the most value long term. So you know we're going to continue to look at our emerging markets. Sometimes, you\u2019ve to weather some storms, and I think that's what we're going through right now. ","Gail Glazerman","Okay, and in terms of the coated paperboard business, can you talk about where you think we are in that process of conversion away from foam? You know are we in the third inning, the eighth inning? And just taking kind of a broader global view, you kind of just referenced some of the challenges in Asia. But anything else as you look at the business globally that gives you any concerns? ","Mark Sutton","Gail, Mike Amick is here and he\u2019s [indiscernible] our Consumer Packaging business and our Printing Papers business. And I\u2019ll let Mike take a shot at your question and then see if we get everything you are looking for. Mike? ","Mike Amick","Good morning, Gail. It\u2019s a good question. I like the analogy to the baseball. I am not sure exactly what inning, I would say we're probably early in the process. We continue to see you know very strong momentum in this space. We had a good year in foodservice and the overall demand associated with that business. But I would probably characterize it as you know, we're kind of early, you know early on in this game and probably in the first three innings. We expect to see continued improvement in this space as a result of kind of the sustainability story associated with our product line. ","Mark Sutton","I think Gail, on the global part of that question, you know we\u2019ve seen a lot of customer acceptance of higher grade fiber-based packaging. So we make this new product at our Kwidzyn Mill. It\u2019s been very well received. Now we are in segments of the Consumer Packaging market from a board manufacturing standpoint, not every segment. And the ones that we're in, you know we think still have some runway and still have a lot of interest by customers. ","Gail Glazerman","Okay and maybe that's like a little bit of a segway in my last question. Obviously earlier in [indiscernible] week we saw a big deal announced particularly perhaps in the Consumer Packaging space. Do you think it\u2019s important for you or would you consider expanding beyond into other substrates? Is that something that you feel is holding you back at all in your business? ","Mark Sutton","Well it\u2019s something -- it\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s something we evaluate constantly around whether or not a fuller line of products and really any of our business brings value to customers. And sometimes the best place to ask that question is in where the customer sits. And so it\u2019s something Gail we always evaluate and you will probably see from time to time that we expand our offering. You know we did it in our corrugated packaging business. But I don't see that we're in a particular disadvantaged spot right now. But it\u2019s definitely something we continue to look at as we should, as a value-creating opportunity for the company. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Philip Ng, Jefferies. ","Philip Ng","Can you talk a little bit about inventory levels in containerboard? You know November was pretty lean and demand trends from most of the public companies that I have reported suggested pretty strong flow-through on the demand side in the early part of year. So can you give us a little color on that trend? ","Mark Sutton","Philip, I would be happy to. You know demand in a quarter, expected inventory needs to service customers in the next quarter, and in the case of the first quarter you start getting the annual outages. And just how we ran and how we operate, all factor into where our inventories end up despite our best efforts on planning where we want them to be. And I think with all that said, I believe we're in good shape from an inventory standpoint. Going into 2015, our inventories went down in the quarter and we believe we\u2019ve got the systems in place to operate in the first quarter without any interruptions because our inventory is too low. ","The one dynamic that we are dealing with and I think a lot of people are dealing with is the transportation network continues to be a little less flexible than it has been in the past. So that influences where we might need to see inventory levels that might be different from what they were in the past. But I think we like where we are right now. ","Philip Ng","Okay and Mark, you kind of referenced you know part of that [indiscernible] on 5% EBITDA type growth for 15 is partly driven by some of the high-return projects that you have going forward. Can you talk about it, if it\u2019s mostly cost takeout, is it more growth related, is it domestic, is it international? Can you give us some color on that front? ","Mark Sutton","I think it\u2019s a bit of -- some of the projects definitely, some projects that we\u2019ve already started in 14 that will benefit us in 15. And I think it\u2019s a mix across domestic and the outside the US businesses. But given the scale of our business, obviously most of the driver is coming from some opportunities in our North American system. There is a little bit of volume or growth I would say in there. And it\u2019s areas where we think we have the ability because of our customer portfolio to grow even in a flat-market environment. So, but the big driver is the first thing you mentioned, which is improving our cost structure and cost takeout. ","Philip Ng","Okay and just one final question for Carol. Can you give us some color on how you are thinking about free cash flow? I know you gave us some moving pieces on CapEx and D&A and pension contribution. But directionally, should we expect free cash flow to be roughly flat, up, down, some color on that front would be helpful? ","Carol Roberts","Yeah I think the -- [indiscernible] the EBITDA number out there. I think the areas you are going to see more cash used is in cash taxes. We had a number of one-off events that happened in 14 that helped lower the cash taxes that are non-repeatable. So I think we\u2019ll see more there and then we talked about the CapEx going from 1.4 to 1.5. But again if you step back from it, it\u2019s going to be another strong year of free cash flow for the company. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie. ","Al Kabili","And I guess a question for Carol or maybe even Tim, if he is there. It\u2019s just, you mentioned some operational issues in the Industrial Packaging side in a mill in Texas, I think in Indiana. And I was just wondering if you maybe can quantify or help us out with you know the extra costs related to that, that hopefully don't repeat there? ","Carol Roberts","Yeah this is Carol. Unfortunately Tim is home sick, so we got the flu running around here in Memphis. But, so I\u2019ll take a shot at it and I\u2019ll see if my colleagues can add to it? So if you think about Orange, Texas we had an outage in December. We found some issues that we chose to spend a little extra money on, and then we had a little difficulty coming up out of the outage which cost us a little production. So you\u2019ve got that item and then you take our Indiana mill where we had our supplier, our steam supplier there had a catastrophic failure at their facility, which meant that we had to pay more for both electricity and steam. And that problem was with us most of the fourth quarter and is moderating and I am looking at my colleagues. I think the swing on all of this is about $10 million to $15 million should be a pickup that we get heading from the fourth to the first. ","Al Kabili","Okay, thank you Carol, I appreciate that. And also in the context of the 5% EBITDA growth that we're targeting for 15, how do you -- how has inflationary expectations embedded in that? Do you see yeah, low oil prices materially you know factoring in that and helping on the inflationary front? ","Carol Roberts","You know that's a great question. You know we take a look at a year like 14 that we would say felt like a moderately low inflation year and yet, you know we still saw a $141 million of headwinds, so it\u2019s a big system and small moves can matter a lot. So the things that are helping us of course are energy, pull through into chemicals, diesel. Wood costs has been stubbornly high, but you know we\u2019ve got our fingers crossed. Maybe we\u2019ll see it turn there and you know OTC will depend on global economic conditions. The headwinds we have though are transportation costs are going up. ","And so we\u2019ve kind of have put some cakes, so it\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019s going to be you know like a 100 headwind or a 100 tailwind. It\u2019s hard to predict how it will turn out. If the economic conditions stay strong, the likelihood of it being a little bit of a headwind is probably more likely and that would be a good problem. And so, we\u2019ll just have to see, so that's a round answer Al, but that's about what it feels like right now. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde, Bank of Montreal. ","Mark Wilde","Mark, I wondered -- just kind of a broad question here. But I wondered if we could get your thoughts on the impact of FX across your portfolio as we move into 15? ","Mark Sutton","Yeah, that's a great question, Mark. And I think what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll ask Carol to kind of give you a high-level puts and takes across the company. ","Carol Roberts","Yeah Mark, you know if you look at the business and you know us well, the primary impact of FX is going to be less around the accounting conversion of profits from euro to dollars, all of that stuff. It's going to have the bigger impact, it\u2019s going to be around really the economic implications of what it does to trade flows, cost competitiveness and where people sell their products, and what we can charge for our products in different regions. If you step back from it, clearly the biggest impact is the strengthening US dollar. For us, a stronger US dollar net-net will cost us, you know it will lower our earnings. ","And I don't know that we've kind of given this number out before, but if you think about you know a 10% depreciation in the dollar, it could be a 15 millionish round number just from the accounting side of it. And that doesn\u2019t speak to any of the economic implications of it. So we're hedged in a lot of places. You know we\u2019ve weakening currency in Brazil and Russia, but we\u2019ve a lot of dollars sales. But the biggest impact of course is you know we export a lot from a lot of places and it will be trade flows that has the biggest impact. ","Mark Wilde","Just another question on a couple of the foreign operations. I wondered if you're able to give us some timeline and improvement down at Orsa. And I also wonder over at Ilim whether it\u2019s possible to give a sort of a longer-term EBITDA margin target of that business? ","Mark Sutton","Mark, I think on Orsa you know what I mentioned earlier is we made a lot of operational improvements as we went through the year and we expect to continue that. Where we've been challenged really is on the commercial side, and so I think we're going to take advantage of whatever the market gives us, but we expect a difficult commercial environment in the Box business in Brazil through 2015, at least with what we can see now. ","But there are opportunities, continued opportunities to improve the operation of our recycle bills there and our box plans. And so I think when and I know it will happen, when the market improves we will be well positioned to take advantage of it. So I think you'll see internal improvements through 2015 and commercial improvements as the economy improves. ","Carol Roberts","Relative to Ilim, we still target and believe that under you know normal conditions, $600 million EBITDA is the target for the footprint and the platform we build out. And depending upon the margin on that, it\u2019s probably in your upper 20s, 28ish percent approximately. ","Mark Wilde","Okay that's helpful. The last question I had, any updated thoughts on Courtland and whether there is any potential to repurpose any portion of that mill, maybe similar to what you did at Franklin a few years ago? ","Mark Sutton","Mark, you know as we always do look exhaustedly at different opportunities for that asset and there's nothing major that has come out of that work there or maybe a couple of small opportunities that are still alive. But I don't see anything right now in the scale of Franklin. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey, Goldman Sachs. ","Alex Ovshey","Mark, first on the EBITDA guidance improvement of 5%, I think you had mentioned that it doesn't reflect much of [indiscernible] improvement. Would you be able to clarify for us, you know what you are factoring in for your volumes in the North American Industrial business within your guidance for 15? ","Mark Sutton","I think what we've been looking at in terms of our plan and the backdrop against what I was talking about our earnings growth is about a 1% North American Box market growth rate. ","Alex Ovshey","Got it, and then on the cost side, you know a lot of talk about the inflationary pressure in freight. Can you just size the total cost for the company for securing rail and truck? And you know what is the inflationary percentage that you are sort of seeing on that cost base in 15 versus 14? ","Tom Kadien","You know we looked across our transportation spend really from rate increases, we're looking at about a $40 million year-over-year cost increase. And then we obviously go and look to -- that's about somewhere in the 3-5%, whether you are talking rail or truck. And we are looking at ways to you know optimize supply chain systems to chip away at that. So we usually typically don't experience the full impact of the rate increases we're able to compensate. But $40 million is probably the number that we would, that we plan for this year. ","Alex Ovshey","And just last one for me on Ilim. Can you say how much free cash flow the business generated in 14 and what the uses were? I know you guys picked up a $56 million dividend which is great to see. But I just wanted to know what the total free cash flow generation was. And then maybe in terms of 15, if we do you know put up $600 million EBITDA in that business, how much free cash flow does that equate to and how much of that could come back to the company? ","Carol Roberts","So let me give you a couple of numbers and I am going to let Jay kind of look for it. And so this is more of a pro forma than it is an actual number right now. But if you think about a business that's got $600 million of EBITDA, think about sustained CapEx is around $200 million. Okay and then you\u2019ve got taxes and I think taxes in Russia is, the tax rate is 20ish percent. And then you\u2019ve got to service your debt and so that's the question of how that will come over time and how much leverage do we want to keep on the business. So you can see that it\u2019s going to be a very nice cash flow generator if you kind of do that math. And the interest that we had in 14 was like $70 million, so a lot of nice cash. And then the question is what do you want to do with that cash, dividends to the shareowners or further reinvestment in the business are the options. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. ","Adam Josephson","A couple of questions on the containerboard export situation, Mark or Carol. One, you know exports are obviously up substantially in the December quarter despite the strengthening dollar and weakness in economies elsewhere. Do you have any thoughts as to why that happened and can you shed any light on how much of that export surge was attributable to your sending board to European box plants? ","Mark Sutton","You know Adam, I think the real driver of why the exports are up is most of what\u2019s exported is Kraft Liner. And that's what we export and we saw actually improved demand for our Kraft Liner segment. So while at the macro level some of the markets were soft in some of the Kraft Liner segments tends to be in some of the fresh food and humidity-proof kind of segments. We saw improvement, and so we had more customer demand and a good percentage of that goes to our own box business in Europe. ","Adam Josephson","Okay and just get along similar lines, Mark. You know the trade press talked about the gap between domestic prices and export prices to Europe being unusually wide at the moment, about a $170 a ton. I mean do you think that gap is sustainable, or would you expect a convergence over time between the two for whatever reason? ","Mark Sutton","Well I think the gap between you know kind of a dollar pricing between domestic containerboard and export containerboard does have a normal control range based on -- a lot of it\u2019s based on FX effects and how containerboard is sold in different parts of the world. So in Latin America for example it\u2019s sold in dollars, no big change in Europe. Some of it\u2019s sold in euros but I think our view is, you know we\u2019ve been doing this for a long, long time before the euro even came into existence. We\u2019ve sold containerboards successfully at $0.84 and we\u2019ve sold it successfully at $1.45. ","And we're in it for the long-term, so I think that gap will move around. But it seems like it\u2019s in the normal band that you would see when currency moves around. And the bottom line is the customers that we have need Kraft Liner and we're going to supply it to them for those needs. And we will make more money in some periods of time, we\u2019ll make less money in other periods of time, but it\u2019s a strategic segment for us. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research Partners. ","Chip Dillon","Yeah first question, I was just having trouble with my phone, is really more for Carol. And it\u2019s interesting, I noticed the tax rate going up from 26 to 31 to 33% and I would suppose that increase has a lot to do with the mix of earnings, especially with the weaker currencies overseas. Is there anything going on that would make us think that that tax rate would continue to move up in future years, or do you think this is a fair place to be, or in fact could it be lower in future years you know if let\u2019s say Brazil comes back? ","Carol Roberts","Yeah, I think the 26 was unusually low because we had the double year of two helpings of extenders and legislations. The 31 was more normal as you would expect. And then the 33 goes up, because as you stated you know we're going to have more US earnings. And with more US earnings the marginal rate on that is higher and so it\u2019s just going to change the ratio. Well I think for us, 33 is probably a good number to plan again. And then of course we will you know work well within the bounds to you know manage our ETR and our taxes and do the things we can best to pay what we need to pay. ","Chip Dillon","Got you, and then a quick one on Ilim. I think before we were using $1.5 billion of net debt and now you are saying 1.3 and I might be wrong on that. Did you actually pay off some of the debt that had been accrued there during the project? ","Carol Roberts","No, that's around the dollars that we\u2019ve got flowing in because of these great operations and margins we\u2019ve got. So we\u2019ve got dollars that are sitting in the bank. ","Chip Dillon","I got you, okay. And then on the leverage, I noticed that with the pension and the adjustment for the operating leases, it\u2019s you know 3.3 times, which is a bit above your long run I guess target with the ratings agencies. Do you think that's going to necessarily cause you to slow down your share repurchases in 2015, you know all things being equal or not? ","Carol Roberts","You know, I don\u2019t think so. I think to say once again, we\u2019ve got a great reputation with the rating agencies. You know we\u2019ve got really incredibly low discount rates, so rates go up. You know we\u2019ll make that liability to mark it again at the end of 15, so we\u2019ll be talking to the agencies about our situation. But I don\u2019t think that it will cause a significant shift in our strategy or our capita allocation at this point. ","Chip Dillon","And then one last quick one. You know I think there was -- and I don\u2019t know who interviewed -- if this was accurate. But I saw a quote somewhere this morning that, it seemed like Mark you had suggested that growing in the containerboard internationally is something that that is important to IP or certainly a potential avenue of growth. And I don\u2019t know, if you could just talk a little bit about how you view the paperboard segment broadly defined in the US and containerboard not outside the US in terms of how those could be opportunities for IP to grow through acquisition? ","Mark Sutton","Sure, Chip. I think what you saw was, I think an interview and we were talking about opportunities to grow our packaging business. And the question was about North America and I said in North America, our primary opportunities are in our box business given where our position is in containerboard. And then I used an example of Orsa as a containerboard and box move in a market where we can do that. And obviously, as we said we're interested in generating shareholder return by doing what we do well and that may include growing our packaging business globally. ","So that was the context of what I think you're referring to. And I think you know consumer packaging is definitely interesting for us, which I think is what you are talking about when you said paperboard. And industrial packaging of course is our driver for the company right now and those are businesses we believe, we have more opportunity and we will continue to evaluate those opportunities. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Manuel, Wells Fargo. ","Chris Manuel","I wanted to ask a question and I am going to try to be careful how I ask this. But you know if we look at and kind of dissect what you\u2019ve laid out here thus far in the call, is I look at you know where you\u2019ve outlined significant amounts of inflation or headwinds, both you know what you had in 14 and what's looking forward to 15. I think of areas you mentioned like wood inflation, wages, regulatory costs with [boiler mac], healthcare, utilities, transportation, etcetera. It strikes me that it\u2019s been almost two years since we\u2019ve had any sort of recovery for inflation or any components. As you know sit today, how do you feel about the potential environment? We\u2019ve demand that's seemingly much better with opportunity to potentially you know recover some of these higher costs that you're seeing and have to work through the system? ","Mark Sutton","Chris, that was very carefully asked. But you know obviously we never speculate on what we might do on pricing to recover our cost. It\u2019s obviously a fundamental in business that you need to think about those things. And, we're talking about what we might do in the future, what we\u2019ve always talked about is the conditions that would need to be present for and that's much more complicated than just demand. ","Chris Manuel","Okay fair enough. Let me flip gears for a second to the coated paperboard business. It looks like you took almost as much downtime in 4Q as you\u2019ve over the last couple of years. Can you talk a little bit about you know where you are set up today there? Do you feel that you\u2019ve kind of got your -- you know are you for inventory levels or are you comfortable that you got what you need done there and you can operate more maybe in line with demand on a go-forward basis? ","Mike Amick","Hey Chris, this is Mike Amick, a good question. Yeah, we took some [LLO] in Q4. But you know, we typically see a seasonal downturn in Q4, and obviously we're working to match our supply to our customer demand. You know overall we feel good about our inventory levels. You can see what's happened with the industry inventory levels as well from the publication. So we feel pretty good about that. We\u2019ve seen as we expect to see in the first quarter, a little bit of a pickup you know in demand over the course of the last couple of weeks. And so, we\u2019ll continue to you know again to manage our supply to our demand, but you know we feel pretty good right now. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. ","Steve Chercover","I know it\u2019s hard to call a bottom on a currency or a stock for that matter, but does it make sense to maybe hedge the ruble impact at some stage on the joint venture debt or is the natural hedge with your operation sufficient? ","Carol Roberts","It\u2019s the natural hedge, Steve and you know the way we say it is we borrow dollars and they are still the same dollars. So there is the non-cash and so when you start hedging non-cash accounting things, you are incurring a cost without necessarily an economic benefit [indiscernible]. ","Steve Chercover","That's fine. I suppose your JV partners have never been happier to get US dollar dividends? ","Carol Roberts","Yeah. ","Steve Chercover","And then similarly I see that you know China, this has been touched on, but that's not listed as you know something that's going to be getting better in 2015, or at least not on page twenty four. I mean how long are you going to tolerate that, is it much of a distraction to management? ","Mark Sutton","That's a good question, Steve. You know we\u2019ve got a good team in China. They manage the business. It\u2019s not a distraction to management at all. And again, you know we wouldn\u2019t speculate on what we would do in all of our businesses. We evaluate them for the near-term, midterm and long-term, and we look at China beyond what we just have in China. We view China as an important market for IP. Carol talked about you know a big portion of the rationale for Ilim is all about China. We import products from the US to China, that they need like fluff pulp and containerboard, and we\u2019ve operations in China. ","So when we think about China, we think about from the IP side, we think about all of those activities. And it\u2019s an important market and we\u2019ve tried to address it in different ways. So I think we will continue to look at that and all of those kinds of ways to serve that market and continue to evaluate it as we go forward. ","Steve Chercover","Thank you and then one other perhaps oddball question. We're well aware that Styrofoam cups are being phased out and it appears that you know all kinds of Styrofoam products are actually you know on the wane. So I'm wondering beyond Bleached Board, are there other substrates where you can win, you know perhaps even molded pulp for take-out containers? ","Mark Sutton","Well I think that's to my earlier answer to a similar question that, you know extending our products and know-how into new uses is something we look at constantly and to see if we can create value. And then going into adjacent spaces, where maybe we look at combining materials like fiber and something else to make a better product. Again most of those markets have valid competitors who are really good at what they do. So if we think about doing it we think about it because we believe we can have a competitive advantage and that maybe complementary offerings with what we already do would be a better solution for the customer. So yes it\u2019s on the table, almost on a continuous basis. It\u2019s part of our business planning and strategic inputs to our strategic plan that we do from our marketing teams. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. ","Scott Gaffner","Mark, just looking at the EBITDA guidance for 2015, you are talking about 5% growth off of the $4.1 billion in 2014. And sort of just compound that in getting to you know $5 billion EBITDA for the company. You know you are talking about 4 to 5 years until you actually reach, if you maintain growth at that 5% rate, so you can get to 5 billion. Is there something in the next few years where you see the potential for acceleration in EBITDA growth within any other businesses that could shorten that timeframe? ","Mark Sutton","Well, that's obviously what we work on every day and we're not satisfied with our path toward our 5 billion. And we talked about this before and one of the biggest misses is we had a slightly better economic environment during that period. And we called it a mid-cycle target, mid-cycle demand, mid-cycle cost and we probably haven\u2019t seen the demand side really. So a small amount of demand improvement really ratchets that performance up pretty quickly. And then you know we've got more opportunities and some internal improvements that we can pull forward. But we really probably need a little bit better economic set of conditions to accelerate it in a meaningful way lacking, you know changing the company in some way. But with what we\u2019ve today is what we said we're focused on getting the 5 billion with the IP we\u2019ve today. ","Scott Gaffner","Sure and a couple of questions on the corrugated business, specifically I mean you talked about for the FX impact on exports. It sounds like minimal impact to your export business or within the normal range. But when you look back historically FX and the impact potentially on imports, is there a dollar strength level where you actually start to see imports incentivized into the US potentially disrupting you know some of the supply-demand balance that we\u2019ve today? ","Mark Sutton","Imports of containerboard have a lot more issues to manage than just the economic piece. So the US market, given the way it's constructed, who makes the boxes and those types of things makes importing containerboard a bit of a challenge. So I don't know if there's a number, I guess there\u2019s always a number. But I don't think we see imports of containerboard in the US being a major, a major issue. ","Scott Gaffner","Okay and then just lastly around e-commerce and the impact on the box business in North America. Any sort of additional work you've done to sort of measure the impact of e-commerce, how that might have impacted the fourth quarter, where it is as a percentage of sales etcetera? ","Mark Sutton","Well I think as a market that segment is still pretty small as a segment of the US Box market. I think it\u2019s 2 to 3% or something in that range, but it\u2019s growing at an impressive rate. You know our business in that segment has been one of our high points and you know in the 15 to 20% growth range. And I think that's how much the segment is growing as well in addition to our numbers. But I believe that's going to continue, but again there\u2019s so many boxes in the US used for other things. And it'll be a while before it\u2019s maybe a major segment, but the growth rate is exciting. And corrugated gets to show its full value to the market in that kind of supply chain, and so we're excited to be participating in that segment. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn, RBC Capital Markets. ","Paul Quinn","Two easy questions. One, whether you could comment on last week, there was a filing by four of your paper competitors on looking for antidumping duties, if you could comment on that? And just you referenced the fluff pulp mix improvement, just if you could give a couple of comments on your outlook for fluff as well as NBSK from Ilim going forward? ","Mark Sutton","Okay Paul, I\u2019ll take the question on the antidumping case, and then I\u2019ll ask Mike Amick to update you on our pulp business. He has the pulp business in our paper sector. On the antidumping case, you know obviously we're aware of it. Our set of kind of conditions are different than a lot of the other players. We\u2019ve a global footprint in uncoated free sheet and you know we rely on the flexibility of that network. So our view on that is probably a little different than some of the other companies that are named in the complaint. But largely we make the printing papers around the world that we make for the local markets or the regional markets and import virtually nothing to the US. So that's not made in the US from our own operations. ","Mike Amick","Hey Paul, this is Mike Amick. On your second question on fluff pulp, obviously you saw from the slide that you know the pulp business had a nice year-over-year improvement. And we feel pretty good about the pulp business, the mix has been a large part of that lever as we\u2019ve taken you know our mix up to, close to three quarters of our pulp. And we will continue to you know to drive that improvement lever and feel you know pretty good about 2015. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. ","Debbie Jones","If I could go back to your Brazil business, you know you are pointing to stable pricing and cost in Q1. I was just curious if there is a concern you know however that electricity prices could impact your paper and packaging business down there in the region for 2015? ","Mark Sutton","Yes definitely, Debbie it\u2019s definitely something we're watching. The electricity prices are very dependant on rainfall and water reservoir levels and we dealt with those issues throughout 2014. It\u2019s not completely behind us by any stretch of the imagination, so you know it\u2019s a potential. We don\u2019t plan for everything that could go wrong going wrong, but we are watching it, and putting contingency plans in for that exact potential. ","Debbie Jones","Okay and then there has been a discussion on the call about you know further expansion into you know packaging outside the US and I am just wondering if Brazil, you did mention this before. If there are any opportunities down there for you that you would see that might be attractive? ","Mark Sutton","You know we like what we\u2019ve started in Brazil. It\u2019s not performing to our expectations, but we think we know how to fix it. And I think if we can show that we can do that, we would like to look at opportunities. Brazil is an interesting packaging market. There is opportunities to do organic moves and there is opportunities to potentially make small acquisitions. There are no large, large players or anything like that. So you\u2019ve to build the business in a different way, but it is something we\u2019ve interest in and you know we\u2019ll only do it if we think we can create value doing it. ","Operator","Your last question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. ","Anthony Pettinari","Just a couple of quick questions on domestic box markets. You know we saw some consolidation by independent coordinators last year and early this year and some capacity coming online. I guess my first question is, are you seeing increased competitive pressure in any of the regional box markets where you compete? And then a related question, you know given price declines in OCC, you know are customers coming to you in any meaningful way and saying that they want you know more test liner and less kraft liner or are you seeing any kind of mix shift there? ","Mark Sutton","Anthony, I think on the first part of your question. You know we\u2019ve seen kind of a normal level of competitive activity regionally as you mentioned based on some new capacity being absorbed. I don\u2019t think anything has really changed in the third quarter or fourth quarter. We just kind of navigated through that process. It\u2019s obviously pushed some product probably to the export markets from the US, but we see that is kind of stable and no real change as the year went on. And again a little bit of growth probably helped in the fourth quarter and would definitely help get that capacity to market in the 2015 period. ","And there's no discussions about you know normal input costs like OCC that would drive our customers to test liner. Our customers really talk to us about you know working collaboratively on what the best solution is. And sometimes I wouldn\u2019t call it test liner in the US as much as I would call it a recycled blend of paper. But the performance specs are really what matter, and that's what the customers are interested in. ","Anthony Pettinari","Okay that's very helpful and then may be just one follow-up. I mean OCC prices have been weak for maybe a little bit longer than some of us had expected. And as you think about your 2015 you know kind of internal projections, do you expect OCC to stay at these levels for the year or do you expect some kind of recovery in OCC? ","Mark Sutton","Well Anthony, that is obviously an important question. Every time we try to answer it, we're like everyone else, we're wrong. So we really don't know, we will monitor it. I think Carol mentioned earlier OCC is going to be a function of global economic conditions based on where the primary OCC containerboard is made. So Asia getting better would probably firm up OCC and other markets like that. So I think you know we're going to watch it and be prepared for you know whatever happens. But we really have no way of knowing generation is part of the impact. Collection rates have improved throughout the world, so we will probably be looking at -- and I must say this. And I\u2019ll be wrong, a stable OCC in 2015. ","Operator","And I will now turn the call back to Jay. ","Jay Royalty","Yeah so we took a few extra questions this morning, so we'll go ahead and wrap it up.

Welcome to today's Second Quarter 2019 International Paper Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Thank you, Mollie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website.","Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2019 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investment, Slide 2 also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities.","I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark Sutton","Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining our call today. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. International Paper delivered solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow in the second quarter. Our performance again demonstrates the strength of International Paper to generate strong cash flows and take full advantage of our system flexibility to deliver solid results in a more challenging environment.","Taking a look at demand in North America. Our box shipments improved seasonally in the second quarter but were weaker than we expected with sluggish demand in a few of our nondurable and durable goods segments. Uneven global demand and continued customer destocking affected our containerboard and pulp volume in the second quarter.","Operational performance was strong and we managed costs well across our businesses while executing our highest maintenance outage quarter of the year. Through the first half of the year, we generated nearly $1.2 billion in free cash flow and returned $810 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Continuing with the second quarter performance on Slide 4. Revenue was down about 3% year-over-year, largely due to the impact of the lower price and volume for export containerboard and pulp. We operated well in the quarter and controlled cost effectively to deliver $948 million of EBITDA and continued strong margins. Our equity earnings were $80 million in the quarter, which includes $67 million from our Ilim joint venture and $13 million from our investment in Graphic Packaging. Free cash flow was $732 million in the second quarter, and this does include cash dividend of $239 million from our Ilim joint venture.","I'll now turn it over to Tim who will cover performance across our business sectors and our third quarter outlook. Tim?","Timothy Nicholls","Great. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 5, which shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share bridge. As Mark said, we delivered solid earnings in the second quarter while navigating through a more challenging environment. Price and mix decreased mainly due to lower prices for containerboard and pulp, which was partially offset by increased prices in our North American papers business. Volume increased on seasonally stronger demand in our North American packaging and Latin American papers businesses, which was partially offset by lower export containerboard volume.","Operations and cost performance was strong. Our mills performed well in our heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year and we executed downtime efficiently. Input costs were favorable with lower fiber and energy cost across our businesses. I'd note that wood costs were favorable quarter-over-quarter after a steep run-up in 2018 and early 2019 due to severe wet conditions in the Southern U.S.","Corporate and interest expenses were favorable and taxes were as expected at about 25% effective tax rate in the quarter. Lastly, equity earnings were $0.09 lower sequentially, which include the $0.03 quarter-over-quarter drag from the noncash FX impact on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt. I'll now turn to the segment starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. Our business performed well against an uneven demand backdrop. Price and mix were favorable mostly due to lower export pricing, which was partially offset by improved margins in our European packaging business. Volume in our North American box business improved seasonally, but as Mark mentioned, we saw weaker-than-expected demand in the second quarter. I'll provide a little color on that in just a few minutes.","In general, export containerboard volume was also weak with inventory destocking and lower demand in the Middle East and Asia. Operations and cost performance was strong. We ran well, we managed costs effectively to mitigate the impact of downtime in the quarter. Our performance again demonstrates the strength of our system and our ability to flex production to efficiently meet our customers' needs. We also completed our highest maintenance outage quarter of the year, and we now completed about 80% of planned outages for the year.","Taking a look at input cost. Wood, recovered fiber and energy were favorable versus the prior quarter and softwood inventory normalized in the second quarter as we expected. On Slide 7, I'd like to come back to the North American corrugated packaging ban and take a closer look at what we're seeing from our customers. Demand in e-commerce and protein segments was strong. E-commerce continues to grow at double-digit rates as we work closely with our customers to optimize packaging design to meet their specific supply chain needs.","Protein, mostly pork, chicken and beef is benefiting from shifting consumer preferences as well as increased export demand. And fresh produce demand has normalized after the late start to the season. Processed food is a large category with many consumer segments. But broadly speaking, demand was softer in the first half of the year. This is in large part due to a drawdown of finished goods inventories for food manufacturers which have trended down since late 2018. We expect customer inventory to normalize as the third quarter progresses, which should lead to improved demand for boxes. ","Nondurables, excluding food and beverage, represents about 30% of the U.S. box demand. This is a wide-ranging category with many consumer and industrial products such as agriculture chemicals, resins, plastics, rubber products, paper and printing, towels and tissue and textiles and apparel. Again, a large category for which underlying box demand is closely tied to nondurable manufacturing activity, which has been soft in the first half of the year.","The weak demand we've seen does have some secular elements such as printing and writing and environmental concerns for plastic consumption. However, the broader weakness is driven by high finished goods inventory since we exited 2018 and lower exports due to weaker global demand and ongoing trade tensions. We do anticipate improved demand as the year progresses and nondurable manufacturing recouples with the strength in personal consumption.","Taking a look at durable goods. Box demand has lagged the general economy through the first half of the year. This segment includes building materials, furniture and other products for which demand is closely tied to housing starts, which has trailed the strength of the broader U.S. economy in the first half of the year. So no doubt, our box demand has been softer than we expected coming into 2019.","When we look at the underlying drivers of box demand, there is a disconnect between otherwise healthy consumption, expenditures for nondurable goods and demand for corrugated packaging that we believe is largely rooted in finished goods inventory levels which continue to unwind. Stepping back for a moment, we are confident that secular drivers such as sustainability, e-commerce and consumer preferences will continue to drive healthy growth for corrugated packaging over the long term. More importantly, International Paper is well positioned. We have the scale and footprint to serve just about every corrugated segment in a material way, and we apply our vast network of packaging design and innovation expertise to understand and exceed our customers' needs.","Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 8. The effect of price and mix lowered earnings by $32 million in the second quarter due to continued trade and tariff uncertainty and persistently high inventory levels. Given that this business mostly serves export markets, today's trade uncertainty certainly weigh on us. Taking a look at underlying demand, we continue to see growth in softwood and absorbent pulp even as trade and inventory destocking pressures supply\/demand dynamics.","Operations were strong and we managed our cost well. We did have a $10 million insurance recovery in the second quarter related to Hurricane Florence last September. We executed our high maintenance outage quarter well and have completed 80% of our planned outages for the year, and input cost improved $10 million on lower softwood and energy costs.","On Slide 9, I'll turn to Printing Papers. Our North American cut size business performed well. We're ramping up shipments with new customers, and realization of previous price increases are following through as expected. Our roll business is more challenging due to weaker commercial printing demand and increased imports.","Taking a look at underlying demand for uncoated free sheet in North America. Through June, demand was down about 3%, which is in line with our view of about 3.5% secular decline. In Brazil, we had stronger seasonal volume and cut size as expected, however, demand for offset was weak due to delays in the government textbook program, which started in June but was about 3 months later than the normal start. Overall, the business performed well and we executed the heaviest planned outage quarter of the year.","Looking at Ilim on Slide 10. The joint venture delivered solid commercial and operational performance in the second quarter with EBITDA of $222 million and EBITDA margins of 40%. EBITDA was sequentially lower driven primarily by lower average pulp prices and higher planned maintenance outage expense in the quarter. Equity earnings were $67 million and benefited from a noncash foreign exchange gain on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt, of which IP's portion was $7 million or about $0.02 per share in the quarter.","Now in terms of the outlook on Slide 11. Overall, we expect lower price and mix, improved seasonal volume and export shipments, lower planned maintenance outages and lower input cost. Now I'll take you through the changes business by business. So let's start with Industrial Packaging where we expect price and mix to lower earnings by $110 million on the impact of prior year index movement in North America and export pressure. Volume is expected to improve by $20 million on seasonally stronger demand in North America and improved export volume.","Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $15 million due to higher seasonal labor cost in our North American box system. And also within Industrial Packaging, lower maintenance outage expense is expected to improve earnings by $68 million while input costs are expected to improve by $10 million on lower fiber and energy costs. In Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to lower earnings by $45 million. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $20 million due to the non-repeat of the second quarter insurance recovery and higher unabsorbed fixed costs. Lower maintenance outage expense is expected to improve earnings by $52 million and input costs are expected to improve by $5 million on lower wood costs. ","Shifting to Printing Papers. We expect price and mix to lower earnings by $20 million, mostly related to export pressure in Latin America and geographic mix. As an offset to this, volume is expected to improve $20 million on seasonally stronger demand in North America and Brazil and lower maintenance outage expense is expected to improve earnings by $33 million. To recap, planned maintenance outages, as expected, we completed about 75% of our outages during the first half of the year. Details by business and quarter are included in the appendix. And lastly, under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture, which includes $10 million higher maintenance outage expense versus the second quarter.","If we look at the full year on Slide 12. On the demand side, we entered the seasonally stronger second half of the year in our North American packaging business. We're also seeing improved shipments for containerboard exports to all major regions as inventory destocking progresses and underlying demand improves. In Global Cellulose Fibers, underlying demand for bleached softwood kraft and absorbent pulp is growing. However, we continue to see a difficult environment as we enter the second half of the year due to trade uncertainties and high industry inventory levels.","And our paper business is performing well. We're ramping up cut size business with new customers and for the full year expect to see benefits of recent price increases in North America. Outside of North America, we are seeing increased pressure in export markets and our Latin American business. Against this backdrop, our revised forecast includes the impact of prior index moves in North American packaging as well as the impact of lower realized prices for export containerboard and for our pulp business. For the full year, we're projecting EBITDA of $3.9 billion and free cash flow of $1.9 billion. Our outlook demonstrates International Paper's strong and resilient free cash flow. Through the first half of the year, we've returned $810 million to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases. You can expect that we will use cash for debt repayment and returns to shareholders in keeping with our principle of maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade rating.","With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, Tim, for the details on the quarter and the outlook, particularly given all the moving parts. The way I'd summarize where we are today is our businesses are well positioned and we're operating very well. But clearly, what the market is presenting to us at the current time has lots of ripples to it. There's no question we're operating in a more challenging environment this year relative to 2018.","Through the first half, International Paper has been able to navigate very well, delivering results better than might be expected in this environment, including a strong level of free cash flow generation, and this didn't occur by happenstance. Instead, our results are the product of the work we've done to improve our portfolio, we've established advantaged positions with low-cost flexible manufacturing systems and we have a laser focus on customers. As we enter the second half of the year and face continuing challenges, we are well positioned to navigate through them as we work on further improving our company. Our focus is on the free cash flow generation, which is the basis of shareholder value creation.","Our expectation for free cash flow generation is strong at $1.9 billion. This enables us to further improve our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. I'm confident that the company we build will allow us to succeed in practically any set of conditions at any point in time. I think about International Paper's future often. And given our company's longevity, sometimes my view of our future is prompted by an important event from the past. The Apollo 11 lunar landing 50th anniversary media coverage that we've seen over the past week is an example of this.","I remember watching the live TV coverage on July 20, 1969, on my eighth birthday. We were leaving that day on a family vacation, but we were all glued to our black and white television watching. What I didn't know at the time and only learned recently was that IP had an important connection to that broadcast. 2 weeks prior to the mission, the sole sponsor on CBS reduced its support, and International Paper stepped in to sponsor 1\/3 of the live broadcast on the lunar landing and moonwalk day. 50 years ago, we could not dream of using the phone in our pocket to honor almost anything and have it safely to our homes in a corrugated box. Disposable diapers were just beginning to gain traction with consumers and have led to other absorbent products that make people's lives better. Just imagine the role renewable, sustainable fiber-based products will play in the future.","For International Paper, the products, ideas and services we provide to our customers in more than 80 countries around the globe truly make a difference in people's lives every day. As a company, we've had many milestones during our 120-year history to be proud of, but I'm just excited about the ones that are ahead of us. As the world continues to change, and we know it will, International Paper remains resilient and committed to improving people's lives, the planet and our company's performance.","So with that, we're ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is going to come from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research.","Clyde Dillon","The first question I have is if you could just talk a little bit about how the conversion at Ash [ph] in Alabama is going -- at Riverdale, I should say, at that mill and how you see that start up. And then as we look at CapEx for 2020, I know it's early days, but directionally, do you see it going higher or lower than the $1.4 billion you're guiding to this year? And actually, I hate to keep piling on there, but you did lower the EBITDA guide from -- by about $350 million from last quarter, but the free cash flow is only going down $100 million. And so maybe you could help us understand that change, especially since you're not changing the CapEx guidance for this year.","Timothy Nicholls","Yes. So just on the free cash flow, a couple of things changed as we lowered the guidance. First of all, we were expecting a bigger recovery of working capital and also lower taxes for that matter. So we had some headroom in the $2 billion that we had talked about. We had never quantified that, but we feel good at a real solid $1.9 billion on cash flow.","On capital for next year, all of that work is underway at this point and so we're still in the planning stage, and we have typically given that guidance as we report fourth quarter earnings in January, and I expect that'll continue to be our cadence. But I don't see it being higher. We had some big projects over the past couple of years that have pushed the number up a little bit, so I don't see it being higher. The degree to how much lower it will be, we're looking at right now, and we can give you more on that early next year.","And then I'll just give you my perspective -- turn it over to Mark, I know that he will want to talk about Riverdale, but I think it's going extremely well. We're still on track. Everything's coming together from my standpoint, the way we expected it to, on the conversion.","Mark Sutton","I would echo what Tim said. We are well down the path of final engineering work. Preconstruction is on plan. The project's being executed very safely. Obviously, we have additional workforce on the project of this size. So, so far, I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making and the schedule that we're on.","On the comment on CapEx, Chip, I'd just take you back to the big picture on what we said long term about CapEx is. We look at our capital allocation based off of our EBITDA and hence, the cash from operations and that, that CapEx tended to be around half of that cash from operations to reinvest in today's cash flows, and its facilities we have today, to take structural cost down, to meet any environmental regulations and then occasionally, to make some strategic investments like the Riverdale project or the Madrid mill.","And so that at a high level how we think about it. And the balance of that cash then goes back through share repurchases and the dividend. So we don't see a big change in those relative ratios of where we move the cash that we generate from operations.","Clyde Dillon","Okay. Very helpful. And a quick follow-up. We're -- we've been reading about Amazon making some changes to their packaging requirements or requests, and I'd say at least half the boxes I get from Amazon have your logo on the box. I do look. I get funny looks from my wife and others when I'm -- that's the first thing I look for on the box. But how do you see that impacting both the company and the industry, sort of some of these moves to streamline packaging with e-commerce?","Mark Sutton","I think the big picture is e-commerce is growing at a rapid rate as a way of doing commerce for consumers, so that's the first thing. And corrugated plays a really important role in a lot of those supply chain solutions. We've said oftentimes that the packaging environment in e-commerce is built for speed through the supply chain right now, not packaging optimization. But packaging optimization is coming. And the good thing is, not only with that particular company but with most of the major e-commerce players, we are at the table and have a very strong position and are helping them to design.","We think the right size and the right type of packaging and the sustainable approach is the right answer for the market. We're not afraid of the changes that occur. The overall segment is going to continue to grow and corrugated is going to play a really important role. And we have the ability to help our customers as they're ready to make changes in the packaging design so that they keep the speed to the supply chain, which the consumer wants, 1-day delivery and so forth, and reduce waste and reduce overpackaging over time. And we have a lot of design capability to do that. So we see it as complementary to what we offer.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari, Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari","In containerboard export markets, I think you indicated customers are destocking inventories and demand is maybe improving or expected to improve. Just wondering if you could sort of reconcile that with the price erosion that we've seen in July? And then do you see stabilization or maybe some inflection in export market prices? And then I think last quarter, you provided some detail on where you thought export customer inventories were by sort of global region. I think Europe in particular was quite elevated. Wonder if you could just sort of update that as well.","Timothy Nicholls","Anthony, it's Tim. Yes, the fundamentals seem to be improving more or less as we expected. If you remember last quarter, we had said we think it's going to take a little bit longer and it did. But now we see that starting to turn. If you remember, the agriculture season in Europe was particularly weak last year. This year, it's much stronger.","So I think people stocked up more -- for more containerboard than what they ultimately needed, but the strength of the season earlier in the spring and now the big season coming up looks to be very good. Those inventories seem to be -- have been worked through and people are coming back to the market. So I think Europe's improving. Latin America is continuing to be strong. Asia was a little bit weaker, but not to the degree that the European -- region-wise.","In terms of price, I mean when you get to this point in a cycle, there's a lot of fluidity. But I guess rather than trying to forecast price, which we wouldn't do, we just say we see fundamentals improving and customers returning to place orders and begin building for this upcoming season, which will be late third quarter or fourth.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. And then the detail that you've given on corrugated demand trends by end market is very helpful. When you talk about other nondurables, I think you said that demand might be impacted by secular trends and you mentioned the decline in print, which I think is understandable, but you also talked about I think environmental concerns around plastic consumption. Just wanted to get any more detail on that comment. Are you actually seeing lower shipments of certain plastic products or is that more of a general comment? Just wanted to follow up on that.","Timothy Nicholls","I think it's more of a general comment. I mean what we would have, we'd probably have to characterize it as anecdotal at this point. But the trend seems to be there from a social standpoint. So probably to a greater degree in Europe where it's getting a lot of air time, but we usually follow Europe on a lot of these trends. And so I think the environmental concerns are starting to pick up, and we'll see what patterns develop over the next few quarters.","Mark Sutton","I think Anthony, the purpose of Tim taking us through that detail was trying to get some perspective from International Paper on what we see through the eyes of our customers in the box market, largely the domestic U.S. box market. And to answer the question or give some perspective on the question, why is demand where it is in 2019 versus what we saw in 2018, and obviously, we know there's a very strong correlation between nondurable manufacturing to the manufacturing to nondurable goods in the U.S. and box demand.","And when you dig into that detail, and we serve customers in every one of those segments and Tim ran through some of those, what our customers are seeing is softer demand for their products for certain reasons but no major conclusions on that. Some of it, we believe, for example, the agricultural chemicals example that Tim gave, is really about the amount of rain and flooding and the delayed planting seasons that have occurred in the Midwest. So those products are delayed in their shipping, and some of them may get skipped this year because of the lack of ability to plant in the flooded plains.","But that's not demand destruction, that's just life happening. So that was the purpose of that, to give some color around what might explain what we're seeing as a major provider of these products through the eyes of our customers.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly, Stephens Inc.","Mark Connelly","Two things. First, Mark, when you think all about the work that you and your customers are doing on supply chains, do you think there is a shift in the amount of inventory that constitutes healthy? We're at 3.8 weeks, and is that the right level or does it need to go lower? And have you changed the way you think about the relationship between inventories and price stability?","Mark Sutton","It's a great question, Mark. I think the -- what we've seen is when there's ample logistics and transportation velocity in our own company and our customer supply chain, we see the ability to operate with significantly lower inventories. Last year is an example where the problems in the rail and truck and ship transportation lanes actually caused inventories to go up, partially to compensate for that. That's loosened up a bit now.","So I think part of what we're learning -- industrial companies are learning is that the variables aren't fixed anymore and you have tightness in transportation, how fast things flow through that you didn't have in the past, a wide variability on that. And part of it is self-inflicted with U.S. rail companies implementing their scheduled changes, and some of it's just supply and demand in the trucking industry that may never completely be where it used to be.","So higher inventories are necessary when the velocity is slower, and lower inventories are possible. So that's going to take a while to figure out what condition are you in and how do you think about inventories and pricing because I don't think it's a single number anymore. I don't think it's this many weeks. It's this many weeks against this backdrop in the supply chain.","Mark Connelly","That's helpful. And one other question. We've clearly seen fluff prices move more closely with commodity pulp prices than they used to. Do you think that's simply the new relationship? Or is that just a function of all the supply and demand disruptions we've been having lately?","Mark Sutton","I think it's the latter, best guess we can look at based on our experience and customers. There's always a certain amount of flexible capacity that can make qualified fluff products or make market pulp, whenever the economics are better and certain parts of the market move in and out. I think China's change in demand and their overall fiber influence on the world is still sorting itself out. So I don't think anything's fundamentally changed other than the softwood fiber market is a little bit disconnected right now, and there are some -- maybe some temporary unnatural flows. And so that has created a little bit more dynamics around specialty fluff -- fluff and specialty pulps that are kind of the top of the pyramid and the more general market grades.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Just to follow on some of the earlier questions on inventory. Just obviously, you took a lot of economic downtime in containerboard and a little bit in the fibers in the quarter. Just wonder if you could kind of characterize where your own inventories were at the end of the quarter and whether you think you'll still need to take some downtime in 3Q to get them back to normal. Or were they in a pretty good spot?","Timothy Nicholls","Well, Brian, it's Tim. We don't disclose what level our inventories are at. Specifically, I would say that at containerboard, we're running our system as we always do. We typically run a very lean supply chain. Disruptions with transportation can cause it to fluctuate a little bit, but we don't like to carry any more inventory than we have to or to serve our customers' needs. I'd say pulp inventories, as you've seen, systematic around the world, are a little bit higher and ours were a little bit higher too. So -- but within line of -- in 1 mill or 2, slightly higher inventory is what we would like to have over some period of time but within a reasonable range in total.","Brian Maguire","Okay. And then just on volume growth trends in corrugated, actually, the box shipments were -- because you noted down 2.1% in the quarter, a little bit weaker than you're expecting. But it sounds like the outlook for the middle of the year, back half of the year, I think most of what I've been hearing has been pretty optimistic. Just wondering if you can comment on anything you're seeing so far in July, if there's a way to quantify any kind of pickup you're seeing and any specific end markets you're seeing some strength in.","Timothy Nicholls","Yes. The comments that we made were focused on the second half where we do expect to see pickup. July has been soft. We came out of June, and it's continued more or less in line with how we exited the quarter. But it's one of the slowest seasonal months of the year. It has the holidays at the beginning of the month. And so our expectation is that we get into the seasonally stronger periods. In third and fourth quarter, we will see the pickup that we're expecting.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mark Weintraub, Seaport Global.","Mark Weintraub","On the customer destocking, would you say we're pretty much at the end of that now or are we still seeing a little bit more of it? And would you be willing to hazard a guess as to the magnitude of impact that might have had on the box business in the first half of the year?","Timothy Nicholls","It's Tim. Let me just start with export, and I think that's where we are seeing a turn. One thing that we did mention earlier, and this is not so much an inventory question, but it is a demand question, the reversal of tariffs into Turkey, which is a large kraftliner containerboard market and a big one for us that we had essentially pulled out of in large ways, has had an immediate effect. The day after tariffs were lowered, we were getting calls for orders.","So I think in the export markets, the destocking is running its course and nearing its end on the back of a really strong agricultural season, especially in Europe and some of the tariff relaxation around Turkey has definitely been helpful. On the -- it's a little bit harder to gauge on the box side, and Mark may want to provide some color here.","But you're dealing customer by customer with what they're telling you about their position and their demand levels. And so it's anecdotal and it's looking across a lot of customers segment by segment. And it's our best read from the conversations that we're having -- that we've had that a lot of the destocking had seemed to work its way through, and it will depend on demand levels in the second half and then an increase in nondurables manufacturing activities.","Mark Sutton","I think the key sign is going to be, and we see it in some of the subsegments, not in all of them, but when we start to see order pick up, that means the nondurable manufacturing is picking up. And again, there's a lot of segments in there. We see the pickup in some. We don't see -- I mean I think in one of the examples I gave around the chemicals related to crop planting, that's a gap that's going to be hard to recover because the season is passing us by. It's just one example where we don't expect a quick turnaround. But we are seeing positive order pickup in some of the other segments, which means those products are now being manufactured again.","Mark Weintraub","I really appreciate you highlighting the export side first because actually, just mathematically, the decline in export has had a bigger impact on containerboard demand than what we've seen domestically. So just focusing back in on that, are you suggesting that perhaps, as we get things rebounding, we could get the export business back to where it had been? Or do you think it ends up being somewhere between the quite low levels in the first half of this year and the very strong levels we saw last year?","Timothy Nicholls","Yes. I think for our business and the customer base that we're serving, we think we can get back.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Edlain Rodriguez, UBS.","Edlain Rodriguez","Just one quick one on the printing paper market. Like what's your outlook in the -- on the market in the medium -- no, near to medium term? And also, why do you think it was like so difficult for the industry to hold on into the price increases in uncoated free sheet? And could they have done something better to manage supply\/demand and pricing?","Mark Sutton","Edlain, this is Mark. I think overall, we don't see a whole lot of change in the Printing Papers business. We're a large producer in the North American market and in the Latin American market. We don't see a major change in the overall long-term demand trend. There are some ups and downs in that secular decline. And when you have these kinds of issues, when you're raising prices in one region and demand might be slower, for example, in Brazil with their economic challenges, you will then see some products move around. So you got a little bit of imports coming into the U.S. We always expect that depending on economics in other places. And I think all that factors into how pricing flows through and how resilient it is.","But we see the business as -- in secular decline but stable and we're operating very well. We've actually improved our position with key customers. And inside of -- grades, like cut size, we've actually grown in the market based on the customers we've aligned ourselves with.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mark Wilde, BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Mark, I wondered if you could just help us with how you think about the economic downtime. If you look at the first half, you took nearly 0.75 million tons. And I wondered, is that coming through just flowbacks? Or have you taken some smaller machines out? And I also wondered if there's a point here where you think about just like indefinitely idling a given mill.","Mark Sutton","It's a great question, Mark. So on the how we do it, we look at our system as a system, and it produces many different grades and types of containerboard based on box design requirements. So they're not all alike or each mill, each unit operation isn't exactly like. So it's a combination of -- and all of our mills have a throttle on them. That's not on, off, so we can run fast, slow, faster than fast like we did last year and we can shut down.","And we use all of those tools depending on the marginal cost algorithm that I talked about quite often and whether or not we can combine it with some other things that we need to do, whether or not we can lower our transportation cost, wood cost, take advantage of recovered fiber versus virgin. All of that goes into a marginal cost algorithm that allows us to look over our 16 mills, look over our order book for the coming month or two and then decide with enough time to shed the cost, what to run and at what output level.","A lot of it is just running less than full output and balancing to maximize our energy production in the integrated mills and so forth. The second part of your question is hypothetical in the sense that we have the system we need. It's very low cost, it's very capable. And we believe the box market long term and the containerboard market globally is growing. So our view is we have the right capacity in the right places. For today, we don't make those kind of a strategic decisions in 1 year or 1 quarter. We had it for today and we had it for the future, and we feel real good about that. We really worked hard to build a system that, as you can see from the results, can do really, really well in a year like 2018 where we were probably running beyond our capacity and a year like 2019 where we're needing less than 100% of it for a period of time and we've adapted very, very well to it.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then for my final one, I just wondered, Tim, if you can talk about the second quarter Ilim dividend. And I guess what I'm wondering is, a, was a dividend of this magnitude in your planning for kind of free cash flow estimates for the year? And then secondly, does the size of this dividend tell us anything about sort of timing and cadence on the capital projects that have been talked about for Ilim?","Timothy Nicholls","No, I don't think it impacts any of their plans strategically about the types of projects that they're planning. The business is throwing off a lot of cash. So this was just a way of returning it to the investors in the joint venture. We did have it in our -- I think we even talked about it. I can't be 100% sure. I didn't go back and look. But I think we alluded to it on the first quarter call that we knew we were getting it. We had just not received it at that point and then it came through during the quarter.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Staphos","The first question is really more a point of clarification. And I just want to make sure that I heard it directly. If we go to Slide 11, which is your outlook slide, the operations and costs delta sequentially for Industrial Packaging, was that a $1-5 million negative or a $5-0 million negative? I thought I heard $1-5 million, which in turn would mean that EBITDA, you're forecasting flat sequentially. But if you could provide just some commentary there and remedial math, I guess, that would be helpful, and then I have a bigger picture question.","Timothy Nicholls","Yes. So George, you're talking about the seasonal labor cost? Just to make sure I heard you correctly.","Mark Sutton","No, the option cost.","George Staphos","The option cost, that delta that you cited.","Timothy Nicholls","It's $1-5 million and driven mostly by seasonal labor cost in the box system.","George Staphos","Okay. So then we're looking more or less flat sequentially in EBITDA 3Q versus 2Q, that would be fair?","Timothy Nicholls","Yes.","George Staphos","Okay. The bigger picture question, and this in part piggybacks on the question that Mark just teed up, recognizing that you don't make decisions on your mill system quarter-over-quarter and you're obviously doing extremely well running the business this year in a choppier demand environment. Is there a practical limit that arise, I don't think you'll give me the timing of that here, in terms of the running to demand? Or can you run to demand as long as you need without any kind of impact on labor, your mill footprint, obviously capacity coming on? When would you have to make some changes? Or would there be a point where you'd have to look at your mill footprint and see what you do from a running demand standpoint?","And then the related question, I guess at one point in time, obviously in the last couple of years, you looked at expanding geographically. How would you guide us in terms of your latest thoughts on that? Would cycle timing and macroeconomic play into that? If you can remind us where would that be independent of how you would use that or view that as an opportunity going forward?","Mark Sutton","Okay. That's a lot, George. I'll just...","George Staphos","Last in the line here, so I had to get it all in there.","Mark Sutton","No. It's good. That's a very good use of one question and one follow-up. On how long can you run, look, we talked about it before at a high level. We think we -- our system runs best when we take about 3% of our available capacity out on a scheduled basis to maintain our assets and then about another 3% for flexibility in order to serve because we're making boxes with this stuff. It's a short-cycle business. You need to be able to turn on a dime sometimes. And so running wide open, except when you're down for maintenance, usually results in higher costs and disappointed customers.","So if you take 3% and 3%, and you say -- if we run 94% over time strategically, we're at our best. But could we run lower than that for a period of time? And I won't define the periods, you're right, absolutely. And then as we put more technology in our mills, as we put more sensors and we have more predictive maintenance, I think we'll change the equation on that again.","And so the labor piece is important but for a different reason than you're probably asking. It is a cost, but we view our labor as a true asset. These are technically trained people that run and maintain our equipment. And so we do everything we can to keep them fully engaged -- paced and fully engaged, whether we're running like last year at a 100-plus percent of our capacity or whether we're running like this year at something less than that because that's a particular part of our value proposition that's really difficult to replace.","So we can run at a flexible level for quite some time. But just to give you the high-level way we'd think about it, flexibility, maintenance and then really using our people and our marginal cost algorithm to make the best decisions we can. On the strategic question about expansion, I think every major element of how we would make a decision, including cycle time and the macro conditions, factors into it. But strategic decisions like you're referring to are really about opportunities to create value over the long term by increasing International Paper's intrinsic value.","And so if it's an acquisition, then it should be clear that it has strong synergies and a strong return and a complementary industrial logic. If it's organic, strong return and the ability to -- obviously, it's not -- doesn't have the same risk profile, but the ability to generate strong returns immediately with the investment.","So the cycle time is important obviously because it affects sentiment, it affects your balance sheet, it affects your cash flow. But I would say all of that is in consideration whenever we contemplate that type of action.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Steve Chercover, D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover","So it's good to hear that e-commerce will continue to be a source of growth, both short and long term, and I had just a couple of questions on that. As we think about the Riverdale whitetop project, was this done in anticipation or maybe in consultation with your e-commerce clients so that products can be placed in high graphic boxes that can also be robust enough for shipping?","Mark Sutton","I think in general, it -- the need for that type of high-quality printable liner was definitely developed in consultation with lots of customers, not just e-commerce.","Steven Chercover","Okay. And make sure it's related on e-commerce. To the extent that some of the smaller packaging might go to pouches, I don't think that plastic is the answer. So are you working on anything that might involve kraft paper?","Timothy Nicholls","Yes. We work on almost everything that is fiber related for our customers. And we actually have products that are already in the marketplace that are using essentially what you would refer to as kraft-type paper.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Adam Josephson, KeyBanc.","Adam Josephson","Tim, just back to the box demand commentary for a moment. Just to make -- so I understand it better, so in the first half, it was weaker than you expected, I guess partly because of weather, partly because of economy, partly because of finished goods inventory destocking. In terms of the latter part, how do you know -- what kind of visibility do you have into your customers' inventory levels because I thought they only kept a few days of a box inventory on hand?","So I don't understand how they would be reducing their inventories throughout the first half of the year and then suddenly build it up in the second half. So can you just help me with how much of the first half shortfall was attributable to each of those factors and then why exactly you think there will be an inventory restocking in the second half?","Timothy Nicholls","Yes. It's a great question, Adam. I wasn't really referring to their inventories of our product. I was referring to the consumer products that they're making and workings through their own supply chains. So that's really the commentary about destocking as we look at our set of consumer products oriented customer base.","And parsing it out and quantifying each one though, I mean it's a variety of those factors where the business is looking at it segment by segment and customer by customer and understanding all of the movements for the 10,000-plus customers that we have, but it's all of the things that you mentioned.","Adam Josephson","Got it. And just on OCC, Tim or Mark, I think you've been of the view in years past that OCC costs were biased up out over the long term. Obviously, we're sitting here at 25-year lows and they're not -- OCC prices don't appear to be moving anytime soon. And obviously, what China is doing is playing a major role in that. Do you have any reason to think that OCC is going to go up much from here? And if it doesn't, what impact do you think that will have on the domestic supply\/demand situation, considering how much of the new capacity has been of the recycled variety, not only domestically but also in other markets?","Mark Sutton","Adam, that's a great question. It's a strategic question. You're right, we had -- have and had the long-term view that if you just look at fiber balances around the world where the growing markets are -- tend to need to use recovered paper as their fiber source and the producing regions of the world that are making that virgin fiber that becomes recovered fiber are slower growing. We don't see a major change in that.","I think China's position on recovered paper has definitely created a dislocation. The question is how long it lasts. But our long-term strategic view is fiber-based products, especially packaging, are going to continue to grow, which would lend itself to a demand for recovered paper over time.","The supply of recovered paper is virgin paper. So if -- in any scenario you can think of, it results in the world taking out virgin paper. In a few months, you've just taken out recovered paper because one is apparent than the other. So I think if you look at the way the system works together, it may take longer and it may not be the time line we had been discussing earlier.","But we think over time, the two types of fiber, original tree fiber and its recovered sibling, are going to work hand-in-hand. There'll be some temporary dislocation. What I want is in excess supply, but if the way you solve that is by reducing the original supply, it corrects itself pretty quick.","Operator","Our last question for today will come from the line of Gabe Hajde, Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabrial Hajde","Two quick ones for you. One is, I guess pricing mechanisms are a little more opaque in the cellulose fibers business. And given sort of the decline that we've seen since late 2018, can you talk about how that might flow through? I mean you gave us third quarter obviously, but maybe thoughts on 2020 in terms of how these price declines that we see on this may impact the business. And then maybe bigger picture, appreciating that the long-term growth for those types of products is something in the 2% to 4% range, how do you think that business trajectory could be to get to that $600 million EBITDA figure that you guys had been targeting prior to some of the, I'll call, global malaise?","Mark Sutton","Yes. We're not going to try to project the 2020 pricing, but the growth rate is accurate, what you've talked about in that 2% to 4% range. And we think that this year is the disconnect for the industry and also for our company specifically. But we don't see any reason why with that growth rate and the role that these products play for the consumer, products companies that are making them, that we can't get on that -- back on that trajectory. It's just going to take a little bit longer.","Gabrial Hajde","I'm sorry, Mark. I was more referencing just changes in price that we've already seen, how that plays through from a contractual standpoint given, again, some of the discounting factors that occur as well as timing lags?","Mark Sutton","So the contract pricing is customer by customer, and some of what you've seen in the marketplace doesn't always affect that. And then the balance of the customers that are using indexes -- and it's not as predominant as you would see on the containerboard the side of the indexes, the pricing driver for the discussion. So it's a bit of a different market. And again, not -- I'm not going to pin July or this year, try to forecast what effects, from what has already happened, it's going to have in 2020. It's not appropriate to do that.","Gabrial Hajde","Okay. And then the last question revolves around an initiative by one of the large e-commerce providers to charge folks back for not being qualified for frustration-free packaging or what have you. I think takes effect in a few days. Is it your view -- or have you -- I'm assuming the answer is yes. But maybe elaborate on any magnitude of dialogue that you had with your customers to respond to that. Or do you think that's something that is still on the come when it actually goes into effect and starts to hit people's wallet?","Mark Sutton","I think it's going to be a little bit of both. I think that the amount of products that were designed, the packaging was designed for a retail display, probably isn't capable of navigating the supply chain for e-commerce direct to someone's house. So that packaging will change, and that we see more likely to change more toward the corrugated or micro-corrugated side and we see some benefit there. But I think people got it figured out. There's some tooling costs and there's some design changes, and then the supply chain is complicated. Can you make a product and put it in your package and guarantee that it's going in one supply chain, i.e., e-commerce versus the retail channel? That's not as easy to do for some companies as it sounds. So it will take a while to work through this.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll turn the call back over to Guillermo Gutierrez for closing comments.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Thank you again for joining International Paper's Second Quarter Earnings Call.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer session.","Now, it is my pleasure to hand the call over to, Jay Royalty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jay Royalty - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks a lot, Kristin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide 2 of our presentation. We'll also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2015 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","With that I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone and thank you very much for joining our call to review our second quarter results and outlook for the third quarter. I'm going to start on slide 5.","International Paper delivered another strong result in the second quarter. Our earnings per share was $0.97 compared with $0.93 last year. In addition to the EPS, free cash flow was substantial at $511 million in the quarter, up from $377 million last year.","Earnings were driven by outstanding results in our North American Industrial Packaging business with EBITDA margin just over 24%. Operations performed well around the globe and we successfully executed 11 major maintenance outages across the entire enterprise. Solid performance continues at the Ilim JV, delivering equity earnings to IP of $67 million in the quarter. I'm also very pleased to report that the number-three containerboard machine at our Valliant facility is fully online and ahead of schedule. The product's qualified, the machine is running great. Finally, I'd note that our return on invested capital for the first half of 2015 exceeded 10%. All-in, I think a very strong quarter for International Paper.","Moving to slide 6 and continuing with our financial results. As I mentioned, EPS was $0.97 for the second quarter. And when you set aside the benefit of the foreign exchange gain on Ilim's debt from both this year and last year, we had a year-over-year earnings per share growth of over 5%.","Now, while revenue was down year-over-year in the quarter and most of that was due to FX impact from our Brazil and Europe operations, we continue to have strong margin performance in the face of several global macro headwinds.","With that, I'd like to ask Carol to take us through more detail in the quarter and our outlook for the third quarter. I'll return at the end to wrap it up. Carol?","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the first to second quarter, you can see that our performance was solid across the board. Pricing and mix were essentially flat with a few puts and takes, and we'll talk about that as we go through the segment.","Volume was seasonally stronger predominantly in Industrial Packaging as we expected. Operations improved and were solid across the board. Maintenance outages, as Mark mentioned, were up significantly but in line with our expectation. Input costs were lower, which reduced energy and diesel costs being offset slightly by higher fiber costs. And finally, the Ilim JV created a positive swing as the FX benefit was partly offset by higher cost associated with the outages and some general inflation.","Turning to the segments, I'm going to slide 8. As Mark mentioned, the Industrial Packaging segment delivered an exceptional quarter resulting in $528 million of EBIT. Prices were down slightly mostly on export containerboard volume as North American box prices, inclusive of mix, were essentially flat. Box margins in Europe were under continued pressure and did contribute $3 million to the decline.","Volume for North American box was up 3% over the first quarter. Operations performed well and maintenance outages came in as expected. Input costs were sequentially favorable. Asia box continues to experience some very intense competitive pressures which further negatively impacted results by about $1 million. So overall, strong results from the Industrial Packaging team.","Moving to slide 9, as Mark mentioned, the recently restarted and upgraded containerboard machine at Valliant is running very well and is fully ramped up and qualified within two months of start-up. This coincides well with the wind down of the purchase agreement that we've been operating under for the past few years. And this enables us to supply our own needs and our customers' needs at a lower total delivered cost. The project's on track and we continue to expect an IRR above 25%.","On behalf of the business, I'm pleased to also announce that the board has approved a series of projects that like Valliant will enable us to further improve our world-class containerboard asset base. These projects totaling about $300 million of total investment across our system have a collective IRR of 20% and will further improve flexibility across the network, enhance our product quality, and reduce manufacturing and supply chain cost. We're excited about the benefits these investments will provide for our customers, the business and our shareowners.","So, let me move on to Consumer Packaging, slide 10. In Consumer Packaging, as you can see on the slide, total segment earnings were down $12 million sequentially, of which about $10 million is attributable to our business in Asia where earnings were substantially lower as depressed demand and intense competitive pressures resulted in lower prices and volume. Earnings were also lower in Europe due to a number of unfavorable items including a lower volume, some higher operating expenses and the impact of unfavorable FX impact due to the weaker euro. Conversely, earnings in North America were higher due to seasonally stronger volume and lower maintenance outage expenses partially offset by lower prices and a slightly less favorable mix.","Turning to slide 11, we wanted to provide an update on a couple of significant projects that are under way and that are focused on strengthening and creating more value in our North American Consumer Packaging business. First, the sale of the Carolina Coated Bristols brand is complete, and the transition of the Coated Paperboard business at Riegelwood into our world-class assets at Texarkana and Augusta is on track for later this year. Following that transition, we will begin the mill conversion project at Riegelwood, which will become 100% pulp, and activities to facilitate that conversion are under way now and on schedule. These changes will streamline and strengthen the Coated Paperboard business while improving and growing our world-class fluff pulp business. Secondly, the expansion of Kenton, Ohio, facility to support growth in our food service business is on schedule as well, with the facility expansion complete and equipment being moved in as we speak, and to be online within the next 90 days. This expansion will enable us to support the new business that we're being awarded by both existing and new customers that benefits both our Food Service Converting and Coated Paperboard businesses. Both of these moves reinforce our commitment to our customers in this important segment and will create long-term value for our shareowners.","Moving to Printing Papers on slide 12. Earnings increased in our North American paper and pulp business due to a more favorable product mix, better operations, and lower input costs. And this was partially offset by higher planned maintenance outage expenses. Prices were higher in Europe, earnings were lower due to higher planned maintenance outage expenses. Brazil continues to be significantly impacted by the recession and reduced domestic demand that comes with that. Normally, we would have seen a pickup from the seasonally slower first quarter, but that did not materialize this year. Second quarter earnings were down $18 million year-over-year in our Brazilian business. And we do expect the current conditions to persist through at least this year and into next.","Turning to Ilim on slide 13, the JV delivered another \u2013 a very solid quarter of results on increased volume and improved pricing. Costs were higher due to higher planned maintenance outage expenses and inflation. Operations continue to perform very well post the ramp-up of the major capital projects which were completed a year ago. As noted earlier, the FX impact on the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt was favorable in the quarter.","Looking ahead, the JV is expecting inflation headwinds to continue and to face some price pressure on softwood pulp in China. However, the outlook remains very favorable due to less maintenance outages, which will enable higher volumes and continued strong operation.","So before I move to the outlook, just a couple of other highlights that I'd like to talk about. First, on slide 14, we raised $2 billion of new debt at an average coupon of 4.6%, and this was for two purposes. One was to fund a tender offer for $1 billion of existing debt with an average coupon of 7.5%. And secondly, to enable a $750 million contribution to the pension plan, which was voluntary. With both of these moves, we've clearly strengthened our already strong balance sheet. We've also been very active with the share buyback program in 2015, having bought back $420 million in shares year-to-date, which brings our total purchases against the $3 billion authorization to about $1.9 billion.","So moving to the outlook for the third quarter on slide 15, volume will be seasonally higher in North America and Brazil Papers, while North American Industrial Packaging will be generally flat. We expect prices to be mostly stable across the board, with improving prices in European Papers offset by continued pressure in EMEA Packaging.","We expect the challenging conditions in Asia to persist into the third quarter. We expect good operational improvement in North American Papers & Pulp, and some improvement in Brazil as well. We expect continued improvement in Industrial Packaging, due in part to Valliant start-up ramp-up cost not reoccurring in the third quarter and better performance in our Consumer Packaging business. All-in across our North American businesses, we expect this improvement to be around $25 million.","Input cost will be a headwind in the third quarter as energy, OCC and rail rate increases hit the North America Packaging businesses by roughly $35 million. Brazil faces some additional headwinds as well, mainly on wood and electricity cost. Maintenance outage costs will be substantially lower, about $90 million, as we move from the heaviest to the lightest quarter of the year.","As far as the Ilim JV, we expect operational earnings to improve due to fewer outrages in the third quarter, which will enable higher production and sales. IP's share of this expected operational earnings improvement in the third quarter is roughly $10 million. And for the purposes of forecast, we don't attempt to forecast FX, so we have here FX stable as of the end of the second quarter, so a non-repeat of the positive $0.06 FX impact.","So with that, now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Carol. I will pick it up from Carol on slide 16. Before I do the wrap-up and open it up for questions, I want just to spend a minute looking at margins across our major businesses around the world. I think this slide captures the strength of IP and the major positions we have in the key markets that we want to serve. The message here is that IP \u2013 the IP that we built today is less cyclical, and we continue to find ways to improve our position and our results.","In the businesses where we have some significant headwinds, cyclical headwinds, I would add, like Brazil, for example, we are generally holding our own with very strong margins, and we'll come out of this recessionary environment a much stronger company.","So in closing, moving to slide 17, International Paper continues to perform well and deliver results. When you look at what we're doing, given the severe headwinds in Brazil and in Asia, and with the strong dollar, it truly speaks of the strength and reliability of our company, and of our performance.","Some of these challenges are more significant than we originally thought coming into the year. On the flipside, we're enjoying strong performance out of our Ilim JV, which Carol covered earlier. And that positively impacts our earnings. Outside of some of these select areas, the rest of the company is performing pretty well. Our margins, earnings, free cash flow, and our return on invested capital at a healthy spread above our cost of capital, are all evidence of this.","We continue to achieve and grow our attractive margins through consistent execution and internal initiatives that are unique and value-creating to IP. We have a pipeline of accretive investment options, the Kwidzyn Coated Paperboard investments, the Valliant number 3 machine, those are two of the more recent ones, and there are more to come, as we highlighted today, all making good businesses a lot better.","We are generating significant and reliable free cash flow year-after-year, and that enables us to return a meaningful amount of cash to our shareholders through our dividend, our share buyback programs, as well as fund some of these attractive value-creating investments. Our capital allocation mission remains all about high-return generation for long-term value creation. That's our focus, and that's our commitment.","And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Steve Chercover with D. A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you, good morning. I had a question about the Sun joint venture in China. I noticed the JV partner is transferring its ownership and it's an acknowledgement that performance has been inadequate. So, does that have any implications for you?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Steve. This is Mark. Yeah. The \u2013 what you saw there is our partner has a couple of different legal entities, and he's transferring some of the shares from the JV into another legal entity, perfectly allowable under our shareholder agreement. We're not satisfied with the performance. We've said that a number of calls now. China is really tough right now, overcapacity and some of the other challenges. But this transfer doesn't really affect our partnership. What we are doing is really working together with our partner in China to kind of manage the JV to the best possible outcome. And we're not finished with that work, but this particular transfer doesn't change the way we're going to operate or doesn't change our partnership.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","What I was wondering, if you were the sole owner of those assets, would you operate them differently?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","We're \u2013 no. We're operating as a majority partner, we're operating the International Paper way. So, we're trying to make the profit maximizing decisions. So, that's why we're working on the high-end mix and really running our capacity to the orders that we want for the economics that are available. And I think we would do that and we do that in collaboration with our partner today. And we do it that way if we owned it all which is not our intent. But we wouldn't change a whole lot.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Well, that's good to know. So, ultimately, to use a phrase that you use, it comes down to industry structure in China.","And then one other question, please, on Printing Papers. I just want to get a sense of what's going on domestically since it was amazing to me that the price and mix is up given what you said in Brazil. So, are things going better domestically, or it's just that you're getting out of some of the commodity businesses?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Steve, I'm going to ask Mike Amick who leads that business for us in North America to give you a perspective on that.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, Mike.","W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging","Hi. Good morning. This is Mike Amick. We're having a \u2013 domestically, both the quarterly performance as well as kind of year-over-year is improved. Once we're seeing strong relative growth domestically with our business almost a factor of three kind of year-over-year versus the market. So, it's a real good commercial story around the brands. Pricing is a little bit down domestically. But as you stated well, from a mix standpoint, we're overcoming a lot of that. So, it is a strong story.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Gail.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Can you give a little bit more color on this $300 million capital program for Containerboard? Any sense of the timing? How many years that's going to lay out? And maybe a little bit more color on some of the work you're doing. And specifically, is it expected to have any sort of material positive (19:00) component?","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Yeah. Hey, Gail. It's Tim. Yeah. The work \u2013 so, it's important because the work that we're doing will be done primarily as we go through our annual outages in the facilities that are affected. A lot of that work will start either very late this year or early next year and kind of go through the year. So, impact to the business and having the capability is more of a 2017 type of timeframe.","You ask about capacity. What we're doing is we're actually making investments that give us the flexibility that we need. In some cases, it's around products and around geography, also around seasonality. So, these projects will add 250,000-plus tons to our system and that gives us the ability to optimize the system and make sure that we're supporting our customers in the best possible way. So, I think 2017 timing, most of these are fairly straightforward from a technical standpoint, so they'll be completed in the annual outages and then they will come up fairly quickly and give us the flexibility that we need mostly on a seasonal basis, but also from a product standpoint as well.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And can you talk a little bit about Consumer Packaging and the price weakness there? Specifically, was any of that and to what extent in the domestic market?","W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging","Hi, Gail. This is Mike Amick. Can you repeat the question? It was breaking up a little. I didn't...","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I guess, some perspective on the Consumer Packaging market domestically. Were your issues really in the quarter predominantly international or was there any sort of weakness or softness in the U.S.?","W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging","Yeah, from a, domestically, we are seeing it is a little sloppy out there. From a shipment standpoint domestically, we're down about 2.5% versus where we think the industry is about 1.5% overall, but most of that is due to exports. So, we're, domestically feel pretty good about the Coated \u2013 the Coated Paperboard business. And most of the issues that were noted are international.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Gail, just let me add to Mike's. On the international piece, some of that was what we talked about earlier, the Asia piece is reported into Consumer Packaging, the Sun piece, and that was a significant piece of that. But also in Europe, we just had some onetime issues that are not chronic, just maintenance outages and some other onetime cost. So, the real international issue, if you will, from \u2013 impacting the results is what we talked about with Sun.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and the details. I guess maybe first start \u2013 first point, with the pension funding, Carol, what does this do to your required funding for the next several years if you haven't provided that in the past? Appreciate it.","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. With this contribution, of course, a little bit will be dependent upon how the whole year ends, where the liability accounting goes and how the asset performance is. But generally speaking, I would say, this would, with our current projections, would push out any required contributions for the next three years. We wouldn't have anything required.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And, I mean, aside of the obvious where we saw that you were buying back stock even into the third quarter, could you update us perhaps a bit more in terms of your thoughts on that being an appropriate use of capital relative obviously to the balance use of capital for dividends? And I want to tie it back to some of your capital projects going on and then I'll turn it over after that.","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, George, what we said, of course, is our capital allocation strategy is we're generating a lot of cash and we believe that that cash generation allows us to both return some of that cash to our shareowners through the form of the dividend and then we've talked about 30% to 40% of free cash flow through the dividend.","We also have said that there's an opportunity to return cash through the buyback and that we would use the buyback, targeted opportunistically. And that also still, we believe we have enough cash flow then to also fund the good ideas. And we talked about some of those today. And so I think you'll continue to see us progress along that pathway.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But I guess, the fact that we saw you buy back more in the third quarter, does that suggest you see more opportunity with the shares here or this is just part of your normal program and balanced approach?","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","(24:05) once again, as we said, it's part of our normal program. And we're going to make our decisions as we go. We're going to be opportunistic. And we're going to balance all those needs as we think about today and as we look forward.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Last question. And, I'll turn it over. Can you \u2013 you've mentioned the returns on the $300 million worth of projects and you mentioned some of the reasons you're bringing it in within Industrial Packaging. Now, as we look at it, you said you're also adding within this about 250,000 tons of capacity in a market that I recognize you, take a longer term view than a quarter or two, that has been perhaps, at least from the vantage point of some people, a little bit softer than would've been expected. You, in fact, had to take some economic downtime in the quarter from the data that you had in the slide deck, I think around 55,000 tons.","So, help us understand why, while adding flexibility, you're also adding capacity, why that is the right move in Industrial Packaging market where there's been a little bit of choppiness here in the last couple of quarters. Thanks, guys, and good luck in the quarter.","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Yeah. Hey, George, it's Tim. Well, I think...","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello, Tim.","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Hey. We do take a longer-term view. We believe that the market will grow over time. If you wait until the growth occurs, to make these types of investments, you've waited too late. So, we're running a very large, very complicated system. And the way we think about it is, how do we optimize, maximize margins sustainably over time. So, this just gives us more capability across the system to run it the way we need to. And these are the types of projects that we look for on a continual basis. So, we'll be looking for more of them. This is one of the ways that we think we can create shareowner value.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim, do you anticipate the returns would cover inflation at least?","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Oh, yeah. I mean, these are 20% returns. These are three times cost of capital. So...","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. We'll turn it over. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Sticking kind of on that, the capital allocation line of question, can you give us a bit of sense of an update of where you think cap spend might be next year? I realize you don't have any finalized plans probably, but a preliminary sense and what the run rate for the next couple of years might be in your opinion at this juncture?","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Mark, Carol. We told you that for 2015, I think we said our CapEx targeted about $1.5 billion, and we said that was the plan. We've not finalized our plans for 2016. And as we've talked about it, if we have these ideas that are \u2013 the bigger ideas that are value-creating, we'll balance that against the overall needs of the system. So, without giving you a 2016 number, it's logical to think that there could be an uptick in 2016 due to the significance of this level of project in our best business. But we'll firm that up when we get to \u2013 probably talk about the third quarter and then into the beginning of next year.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. As we think about the spend, how much of it is going to the 20%-plus type of return projects versus how much of it is more environmental, maintenance with lower returns? How might we think about that?","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, as we've talked about it \u2013 and again, these are round numbers, we provide a lot of this information, and it changes a little bit. If you think about the company, about $1 billion for maintenance regulatory on an ongoing basis to take care of the fleet we have today. And then if you think about the balance, the $400 million to $500 million, about half of that would go to what we would call, let's say strategic projects. A great example of that would be the expansion of Chem (28:22). Strategically, growing that business. You could talk about that as the Riegelwood conversion, strategic project to, say, grow and then strengthen the fluff business.","And then the balance, which would be \u2013 and that would have \u2013 that would be returned capital \u2013 and then the balance, the $200 million or so would \u2013 $200 million to $250 million, would go towards high return cost reduction projects. And the returns on those projects are 30% plus. That's been the capital allocation for the company. But once again, if we get good ideas where there's a bigger opportunity, like we've talked about in the Industrial Packaging business, it'll have to be balanced against those other things. And one of the things that we'll think about is, if we can deploy capital at good returns that's value creating, we're going to stay constrained on CapEx, but we're not going to slow ourselves down intentionally when that's not a good idea.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. That was really helpful. Thank you. And just one other one, if I could. Couple years ago, you had the annual Investor Day. And when you first mapped out the capital allocation strategy, you talked about ramping the dividend up pretty quickly for a few years and then probably getting to a more moderated rate. And I think that, at the time, you kind of talked about like a three-year ramp in the dividend. And I think this would have been the third year. Is that still the way we should be anticipating things, that we have one more sizeable ramp in the dividend before most likely moving into a more metered increase?","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You know, Mark, I would never predict what the dividend will be, of course that's Mark and the board to decision that, but our strategy is pretty clear. We said, as we can grow the earnings and the cash flow of the company, that the dividend's an important part of that, and we'll evaluate that. We said the dividend is going to be meaningful, incremental, predictable and then there'll be an opportunity to reevaluate that at the right time.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dr. Mark Wilde with BMO Market.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Carol.","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","To just to kind of follow on Mark's question. You guys have had a 5% EBITDA growth target sitting out there. Any updated thoughts on that? It looks like it will be a challenge for this year, just judging from the first half.","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Mark. This is Mark. That's a great word. I think it's \u2013 another way to ask that is how realistic it is. It's definitely a challenge for this year. That 5% EBITDA growth target that I talked about before we started the year, as we headed into the year, had a certain set of economics assumptions attached to it, some of which are not materializing. So, yeah. It makes it pretty difficult. It was a bit aspirational, as I mentioned in follow-up discussions.","But that's the kind of growth level we need to be shooting for as a company, to really produce the kind of returns our investors expect. It won't be an even process, obviously. But as we talked about in the results, we're pulling every lever we can with the company we have, and we're going to continue to shoot for levels like that. But it's definitely a challenge with some of the economic activity we see in Brazil, for example, being in a \u2013 I would say, a much deeper recession than we probably considered going in. And China being a challenge. Those two areas alone, and stepping back a bit instead of moving forward, take a big chunk out of the ability to do that.","Earnings per share, on the other side, it's not one metric. Earnings per share, it's also important and that is up in that neighborhood year-to-date. And what is probably our overall guiding principle for long-term value creation, which is ROIC, we've got that in a zone that we want to be in, a couple hundred basis points above our cost of capital, and we'd like to be able to show that, through good times and bad times, we've got a company that's flexible enough to really sustain that, and generate that near $2 billion in cash, and have that be something that investors can depend on.","So, yeah, challenging is a good word for the 5% EBITDA goal. But we don't give up easily. So, we'll keep working on it.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. I'm glad to hear that. And Mark, I wondered if I could also get you to just maybe take two steps backward. We're at a period where we've got a lot of big foreign exchange moves out there. And I wondered, if you look across the IP portfolio right now, where would you say the foreign exchange movements are creating the greatest stress, or the greatest changes, in your business?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","We got \u2013 we've got several impacts and, obviously, Carol is tracking that for us. There are puts and takes, and some of them are not completely intuitive, but I'll ask Carol to kind of give our summary of the overall. And then if there's a specific area, we've talked about Containerboard and some of those long-term demand issues, be happy to comment on that. But Carol, the overall summary?","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So, the easiest one to do the math on, and it is a headwind for us, is strictly the earnings that we get out of Europe, and the earnings that we get out of Brazil, are coming in a currency that's weaker. So when we convert that to dollars, there's less. And so, as we talked, the first quarter call, we said a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar is a $50 million-type headwind. That's probably still pretty good math, and we know the dollar has strengthened more than that.","So that's the easy math. Where it diverges, and it depends, is the currency in a country, how it impacts the market access and the competitiveness. In the case of Russia, the weak currency has been great. We're doing well there. We make in rubles. We sell in dollars. We've got margin expansion. And then conversely, in Brazil, it's actually been \u2013 hurt us. So, you got a good guy. You got a bad guy. And then in the U.S., we are exporting 20% of what we produce, and so while we're able to export our products, our margins are down. So, long answer is, there's pluses and takes on the market side. But overall, a stronger dollar is a headwind for International Paper, and it's probably a bit more of a headwind than when we first anticipated. But we're managing through it, I think, quite well.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And I just -just a couple of follow-ons on the FX impact? One is, you've talked over time about wanting to export kraft linerboard from the U.S. to supply your offshore operations. I wondered, is the dollar strengthens, whether that strategy is shifting at all? And then I wondered if you could comment on some reports we've gotten of containerboard imports coming in from Europe and from Australia?","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Hey, Mark. It's Tim. No. It doesn't change the strategy. Currency moves up, it moves down over time. As Carol mentioned, it has hit our margins in certain places, but we believe in the channel for the long term. So \u2013 and we make good money in the channel. So, we would make more if the dollar was weaker, but we still like the business that we have today. And so, if it changes dramatically from where it is, we can always reevaluate, but nothing that's happened that changes it today. Australian paper, I think we've had some market reports of West Coast activity, but not in a major or significant way that I'm aware of.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's helpful. And, anything on the East Coast? I'd been hearing a little bit about maybe some European paper, Tim?","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Hadn't heard it, no.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. That's helpful. Good luck in the second half.","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Just two things. I wonder if you could tell us how significant the system optimization impact of Valliant might be. I'm thinking in a system as big as yours that the impact is going to be pretty regional, but it is in a pretty important region, so I'm just wondering if you could scale that for us.","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Yeah. Hey, Mark, it's Tim. What it does for us is it gives us a product we need overall and certainly in a geography. So, it helps us as we shift down \u2013 product down into Texas. It helps us with the West Coast, and it also helps us with the Midwest. So, this 360,000 tons we're running primarily medium, which we're short on medium to begin with. So, it's a product we need and it's freight-advantaged to the places we need to get to.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just one other question, how is Orsa doing and is that a place where you're likely to find attractive reinvestment?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Hi Mark. It's Mark Sutton. Orsa is living in a containerboard and box market that tracks GDP exactly. So, GDP is heading toward minus 2 plus a little bit and that's what we're seeing in demand. So, we've got some big customers that are in special segments that are probably doing a little worse than GDP. One of them is the electronic segment, big year last year with the World Cup and televisions, a soft year this year. And we've got big poultry and protein customers that are having issues with the regional drought. So, demand is down.","The good news is on the internal improvements, efficiency in our box plants and in the containerboard mills made a lot of improvement. So, further investment, I mean we'll keep our eyes and ears open. We really do need to get the improvements that we think we can get even with a difficult economy at Orsa before we go to a next step, but we are improving internally. The market's challenging, though.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. But it sounds like the assets are running pretty well.","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","We are \u2013 I mean, we've made some improvements on the mills and the box plants. We've done a lot of best practice transfer from our U.S. system which has really taken hold. And so, we're making some improvements that we can keep \u2013 hold and keep and we need to get the commercial piece \u2013 commercial piece up.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Carol, just one quick clarification. You mentioned the prepayment on the pension plan would prevent the need for having to make a contribution for three years. Not to be picky, is that \u2013 does that include 2018 or are we talking 2015, 2016, and 2017?","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, I was talking 2016, 2017, 2018 generally speaking. Still, things can change so, but under the assumptions we would have today.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I understand. Got you, interest rates, et cetera. And then on the CapEx, you mentioned this year you're spending, I believe you said around \u2013 depreciate (39:47) $1.5 billion or so. Would the projects and the good ideas you talked about including the Industrial Packaging $300 million initiative, does that alone, given the pace you expect that to take, likely take that number up for next year or would you have to find some other things? And I'm thinking there might perhaps be some offset from the Boiler MACT situation, I'm not sure when that actually phases out. But maybe you could let us know how that looks right now.","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And that's why I said we haven't finalized our numbers for 2016, but with the slug of capital of that size coming in, a very important project. It's likely that it would be \u2013 might be difficult to maintain the spending at the one-size level, because we might not want to. I mean, what we want to be careful about is not delaying some really good ideas that are the cost improvement ideas. So, we'll look at it, we're going to stay in a capital constrained environment. We're going to be very judicious. But we're going to want to make sure that we can run the system the way we want to.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. And this is one for Tim. You know I know with the, you mentioned the volume. I think, Carol, in her comments, was up in boxes about 3%, if I'm not mistaken, year-to-year. And as you look at your system and I think about the whole country and the continent really not adding, to note, any virgin-quality linerboard. Are you all having to pull tons in from offshore because the industry data don't seem to suggest that, or has so far you've been able to get those extra tons by flexing your system? And I suppose as you look at 2016, if we see another similar type growth year and kind of before this incremental tons come on, could you see yourself in a situation where you might have to pull some tons from offshore back into the states?","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","No. I mean, situational, Chip, a moment in time but I don't think so. I mean, I think we have a pretty flexible system. We're adding to that flexibility, so that we can do what we need to do. And you mentioned the 3%. That was sequential not year-over-year. But, yeah, generally, we have a more favorable view on longer term growth, and we want to make sure that we are doing now what is needed for future periods. So, that's the reason for some of this investment.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then the last one I suppose for Mark. I noticed the U.S. portion of the Consumer Packaging business and it's great that you gave us that detail because the overall segment was down, but certainly the U.S. part was up nicely year-to-year. And I suppose some of the initiatives there including food service are helping. Is that business sort of seen as a rising star within IP, the domestic Consumer Packaging business, or even though it appears its returns are still below the other major segment, Industrial Packaging, it still has a ways to go?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Chip, this is Mark. I think Consumer Packaging in North America, as we've said, is an important business for us. We've got some really, really good customers both on the coated board side with the high-end SBS grades that we make in the U.S. and on the converting side with our cup business. And it is growing and it is a business we think we can improve, I mean, really, Riegelwood was kind of a double, not a single. We're improving our fluff pulp business, but that also improves our Consumer Packaging business by putting all of our board production in two of the best mills in the world instead of spreading it across three.","And we're growing our Food Service business and continuing to look at strategic options to kind of improve that business. And so, it is important to us. International Paper increasingly is moving in more packaging. And Consumer Packaging, we made the investment in Kwidzyn in Europe for high-end board and that's working out really well. And you mentioned Food Service here in the U.S. and it is \u2013 I don't know about a rising star, we don't use those terms, but it is a business we're excited about.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning.","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Scott.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just going back to these capital investments. Mark, you talked about your view of market growth going forward, I guess, the market's been relatively flat at least in North America over the last few years. Can you talk about what's driving that view for potential market growth as maybe as we move in, later into 2016 and 2017?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Scott. I think one of the things we kind of probably need to just step back on, we've talked about our Industrial Packaging business as a multichannel business. So, we've got a Containerboard business that underpins the Industrial Packaging business. And we view containerboards \u2013 the kraft liner component of Containerboard as a global \u2013 globally competitive product that the U.S. south is blessed with the right fiber to be globally competitive and we're the largest producer of that.","So, we've had long-term strategic outlets throughout the world, not because our price is good or our price is bad, because they need the product. So, when we talk about investing in our Containerboard system, think outside of just the U.S. market, we're thinking about all channels. Our own box business, the open market customers we have which are fantastic customers in North America and the open market in IP-owned box plants overseas and non-IP box plants.","That's the premise we start with, not the 1% or 2% or lack thereof in the U.S. market. And, the other thing you got to remember is we're always going to have fluctuations in a converting value-add business. We're going to make the product for the orders we have in all three of those channels. We've got seasonality with maintenance outages. So, we end up having to manage inventory differently.","A lot of things that Tim described make that business better. And if there's growth, we capture it, absolute growth. If there's not growth, we lower our cost by making some other decisions down the road, what with capital or other types of decisions. So, it's a win-win strategy of making a really good business better. And I don't think about it as a domestic issue of the box market in the U.S. driving every one of these decisions. And we've shown that quarter after quarter after quarter, in good FX times, bad FX times. When a product is good and it's needed, it works.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. I appreciate that. And then on the returns from these projects, the 20% IRR, how much of that is driven by internalization of tons that you're currently buying in the market versus this overall system optimization strategy?","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Yeah. It's a mix of all those things. It's making more of the volumes that we've had to buy in the past as the agreement comes to the end, but it's also cost reductions, not only fixed because of the volume but variable as well. So, these projects, they help improve quality. They give us the flexibility we need. Just to add on one point that Mark made, we're running a system where the way we think about servicing that system across all the channels is pretty critical. And the carrying costs on a few incremental tons of inventory to support our system is pretty low versus the operational cost of not having what you need, where you need it, when you need it. We're trying to make decisions two months and three months out on somewhere between 12,000 SKUs and 15,000 SKUs of board that get used on any given day. And so, if we're wrong by 1% in terms of accuracy, it's costing us $10-plus-million to fix all of that, and sometimes a lot more. So, all of these projects not only give us incremental capacity in a given region for a given product, but they help us manage and optimize that system.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for the answers. Good luck in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Just a follow-up on the containerboard system optimization. When you look at the capacity that you'll add, not only the 250,000 tons but maybe even thinking about opportunities for growth three years to five years beyond that. Does the opportunity to add low cost capacity come from debottlenecking existing sites, or do you see a potential to repurpose assets that are producing other substrates, like white paper? And then just beyond containerboard, looking at fluff, following Riegelwood, can you talk about conversions generally?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Anthony, this is Mark. I think we've got opportunities in, when you look at our asset base, and I've commented on this before, we've got very, very good assets in really all of our businesses. They happen to make the product they make today, but can be reconfigured to make other products, and we've got the right work force, the right technical age of the assets, and what's probably more important than anything on the cost side, is the right fiber basket.","So, we've got opportunities, a lot of opportunities in the company, to make our good businesses better by organic debottlenecking, as you mentioned, but also by facility conversions. There's further opportunity in fluff if we need it, and our customers need it. There's opportunities in converting assets that are currently making one type of product to make another type of product. And that's one of the benefits we have is, we have a lot of choices about how to do strategic projects that help our existing businesses.","We built what we have by big M&A activity. And what we didn't say is, we want to just kind of be satisfied with what we have. We want it to be the absolute best it can be. And now we're investing in what we built, in one way through M&A, we're investing in ourselves now by making what's really, I think, competitive and good, great.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Just to clarify, is the 250,000 tons coming from existing containerboard mills, or could those \u2013 that 250,000 tons potentially come from another source?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","These investments are coming \u2013 that Tim described and that Carol described in the opening comments \u2013 are coming from our existing containerboard system.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then I just had a question on the North American uncoated freesheet market. I mean, it's like we're hearing some conflicting things with anti-dumping duties potentially next month. It sounds like some importers have backed off from shipping into the U.S. but, at the same time, RISI had some price cuts last week. Is the uncoated freesheet market, in terms of pricing in North America, is it getting better, is it getting worse? Is it stable? I was wondering if you could just provide any color there.","W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging","Hi. This is Mike Amick. And you see the \u2013 in terms of the pricing, we have seen a little bit of slippage. But in the context of the anti-dumping, overall the \u2013 you're seeing or maybe hearing some of the same things we are, this will play out over the coming months. In August, we expect to hear a ruling on the anti-dumping. And we've \u2013 but right now, things are pretty stable. Our business right now, domestically, is pretty strong. Little of that is actually coming from what we would consider to be a tailwind from the case itself. This is just continuing to be the strengthening of our business and our brands, which is very encouraging. So, I think we'll see this play out over the next 60 days or 90 days.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, and congratulations on a very strong quarter.","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Chris.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I kind of want to come back to \u2013 you've touched on this a couple different ways, but I just want to kind of maybe probe a little more about it. When we look at your box shipments, first quarter, second quarter, they were down 1% each. I know industry's been up. Maybe, is that some related to just mix or timing or \u2013 you've been now a couple quarters below industry.","And then two, kind of in relation with adding capacity and doing some work there, right? Clearly, you're, at least the data I'm looking at, shows your corrugated shipment's up. So, there's more going to export and other places. But when you think about balancing that, it sounds like \u2013 just maybe help me understand the process of, you want to have the right grades, the right places, so maybe it's \u2013 even though you're going to have it, you don't necessarily operate it. You take more downtime in it? Am I thinking about that the right way as well?","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Well, we run what we need to run to service the customers that we have. So, yeah. In a moment in time, I see the perspective of there being a contradiction there. But on the box side, it's all the things you mentioned. We made some choices about customers late last year that kind of went through the pipeline, and exited our portfolio of customers earlier this year, and some of the newer business that's coming in is, as we mentioned last quarter, is ramping up over a period of time. So ,yeah. In a given quarter or a given moment in time, you can have some of these disconnects, but we do believe that our business grows over time, and we want to make sure that we're supporting that growth the most economical way.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is it your anticipation then that, probably as we get towards the end of the year or maybe into 4Q, that you'll begin to track sort of more in line with industry levels?","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Well, it depends on what the market does. We know we have a pipeline of business coming in. We know that we have a customer portfolio that is performing at various levels. In some cases, some of the customers that we have are suffering their own market-related issues around share and the type of products that they make. So \u2013 but yes. Generally speaking, we would expect that over time, we would track closer to market.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Carol, in the past you've talked about your capital spending plans that being in the \u2013 you hit about a $1 billion or so of maintenance, but being a $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion kind of those extra spending elements helped offset inflation in different components that way. With the identification of some of the new projects and then this year I think you were already a bit elevated, should we think about as a whole across your system if you're spending $1.5 billion or so this year, and I think you kind of hinted that potentially it could be even taking a little tick up next year, that as a whole, you're spending more than offsets inflation or is there something you're seeing potentially on the inflation side that you think might be a bigger hole to offset?","Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Chris, I think you really hit it on the head at the end. And once again, you step back from our capital allocation strategy. We have said we're going to return a lot of our free cash to our investors, which we're doing. But there's cash left. You can reinvest that cash in acquisitions which we've done, some with great success and some with challenges. Or we could take some of that cash and reinvest that cash into businesses that are above cost of capital returns to create even more value. And we've been talking about this.","So, the anticipation is, is that incremental investment is for earnings growth. It's to do more than offset inflation. We think about that base spending as the kind of things we need to do, that $1.4 billion level, $1.4 billion , $1.5 billion and it just depends point in time of some the maintenance expense we have about as a sustain level to kind of just keep pace.","But what we're seeing, what you're seeing us do now is reinvest in businesses that we have a right to win and to create more value. Not just to stay still. And we think that given where we sit as a company right now, that deploying some capital in that direction might possibly make more sense than say what we've done in the past which is spend it on a bolt-on acquisition.","But at the end of the day, it's cash being deployed to create to value. I hope that kind of answers your question and kind of puts a face on this incremental capital that we're talking about.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","It does. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys. You took some economic downtime 2Q in your Containerboard business. Can you kind of help us frame what your expectation is in 3Q and then back half in general? Are you comfortable with your inventory levels? I appreciate you know. You guys obviously have transportation (58:02). But just kind of help frame how should we be thinking about it sequentially in Q3?","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Hey Philip. It's Tim. As a general rule, we don't forecast how we're going to run our system going forward, but the philosophy is that we try to maximize our earnings performance given all of the \u2013 if you heard earlier, all the considerations that we take into account, about how to have the product we need in the right place at the right time. And so, the downtime that we took, export channel was a little bit softer than we had anticipated in the second quarter. And so, we balanced our system out to account for that. That's just how we run it.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got you. And can you help frame how you thinking about box demand in the back half? I appreciate you got some new business coming in. And, Mark, you mentioned earlier, coming in the year, there's a more upbeat outlook on the macro. Obviously, Brazil and China slowed down a bit. But just curious to get your thoughts on the U.S. economy and box shipments, broadly?","Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers","Yeah, for \u2013 this is Tim again. For the indicators that we look at, we still think the second half of the year is going to be pretty good. We think that 2015, from a box demand standpoint, should be a fairly solid year. Now, we're not talking about 2.5% or 3% growth but in that 1% to 2% range based on the indicators we look at. Those indicators, obviously, get a lot fuzzier the further you look out in time. But here, in the immediate future, we still are somewhat encouraged by market growth.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then when you think about the investments you guys are making, you're obviously stepping a lot of that for internal investment. Is that a, kind of a reflection on how your pipeline was looking for M&A? And do some of your recent investments abroad on the M&A front, has that kind of set the hurdle rate a little higher going forward if you, do you approach M&A abroad?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Phil, that's a great question. And, what we've been saying is \u2013 what guides our investment strategy is creating value. And we've done a little bit of everything. Large M&A, as Carol said, some of it's worked out very well. Some smaller things in developing markets that are still a question mark or have not worked out very well. And because of that, we haven't done as much, other than cost reduction, as much of reinvesting into some own organic businesses. The Containerboard business is a great example. We didn't have that business to invest in several years ago. But we have it now and it's the best opportunity to create value of all the choices we have. So, it's not so much that the hurdle rate's changed. It's back to what guides us, and we believe we can create more value for the long term, which our shareholders should appreciated by making these investments instead of some other choices.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very helpful, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. You guys have highlighted a lot of expected investment in North America. Mark, in the past you've talked about potential for investment in containerboard in Russia through your Ilim JV. Can you just talk about or frame this opportunity and whether or not it's something you'd be considering for 2016, or is this something we'd be looking at as more of a three-year or five-year time horizon?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, obviously, the investments in Ilim are a process with the Ilim board, which we, of course, are members of. But we do make some containerboard in Ilim and it's going very well. And Russia is a great soft wood basket. But right now the focus on Ilim is really getting the maximum potential of the investments we've already made, in specifically the Bratsk pulp mill, and that's going very well.","And so, Ilim has a Board and a CEO and we're involved in that and strategy is being developed. But Russia is a great place for containerboard from a fiber standpoint. More logistics issues have to be solved over time. But we have a small position in containerboard through our Ilim joint venture and it's going well. But there is no imminent next move. It's really optimizing what we're doing right now and that's going well.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And, just one last one on printing paper. Your maintenance target for the year seem to come back I think primarily related to Brazil and North America. Is there anything that we should read into that there, anything being pushed out?","W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging","No, not \u2013 This is Mike Amick, Debbie. This, our maintenance, for the large part, at least (1:02:41) the biggest piece of our maintenance is behind us in the first half. We still have some \u2013 a couple of outages here in the second half, but nothing is being pushed out in North America.","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","No, the maintenance outages outside of North America, they move around based on what we're trying to accomplish in the particular outage and then managing, obviously, seasonality issues with customers. Some of the mills like Kwidzyn are comingled with coated board products. And so, that is another market that drives the timing decision. But, no, I wouldn't read anything into that. We're continuing to do our maintenance outages to make sure that what we run is, first and foremost, safe and reliable and can make it between outages in the best possible, lowest cost way.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good luck in the quarter.","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Debbie.","Operator","Our final question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Market.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Holy cow, snuck in there. Just two easy questions. One on the Pulp side, realizations in North America were up $8 quarter-over-quarter. Just wondering, is that a mix issue?","W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging","That, it is a, primarily driven by mix. We had a little bit better performance in our fluff system which was able to generate some, obviously, improvement from that standpoint. So, primarily, yes, Paul.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just over on India with Printing Papers, lost money again in the quarter. Is there a longer-term plan here to reverse the slide?","Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Paul, yeah. The India business \u2013 the volume is growing. We've got \u2013 we've had some cost issues. And so, there is a plan to improve the business. And as we said originally, what we're trying to figure out with the Paper business in India is we're trying to figure out the market and what our participation level could be in the future.","Some of the India numbers that we report are really other activity that we have beyond just the Paper business that just \u2013 is kind of the carrying cost when you start in a new region. But the underlying demand and how we're running has improved. But we definitely have that in this overall review that I've talked about doing with our portfolio. And India, like everything, else is a part of that. And we're making progress on that.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the help. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our Q&A portion for today's presentation. I will now hand the program back over to Jay for any closing remarks.","Jay Royalty - Vice President-Investor Relations","Well, that concludes the call.

Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are John Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation.","We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter and 2013 earnings press release and today's presentation slides.","Lastly, given our expanded disclosure around our Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John Faraci.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everybody and thanks for dialing in. Let me go over the format that we're going to follow this morning. First, I'll review our full year 2013 results. And then turn it over to Carol Roberts to speak to the fourth quarter. And she'll cover the performance of the individual businesses. Then we'll cover the first quarter, as well as the 2014 outlook. And as we usually do, we'll open up for your questions.","So I'll start with the full year. For the full year, International Paper achieved record operating earnings of $1.4 billion, as well as record cash from operations of $3 billion, driven by margin expansion across many of our businesses.","EBITDA increased from $3.7 billion in 2012 to $4.1 billion in 2013 and EBITDA margins across the enterprise increased by 80 basis points. This drove strong free cash flow of $1.8 billion, which enabled us to return $1 billion of value to shareowners through dividends and share buybacks and strengthen our already strong balance sheet by paying down an additional $650 million in debt.","We had solid operational performance across our key businesses. Additionally, we saw good progress in the ramp-ups at Ilim by the end of the year. We'll talk about that a little bit more.","For the full year, however, though, higher cost of the startups of the projects and the devaluation of the Russian ruble on the JV's U.S.-denominated debt significantly impact the joint venture's year-over-year results.","We spent a good portion of last year working hard on the opportunity to spin and merge xpedx with Unisource. And as I think most of you know, last week, we announced that we signed a definitive agreement with Unisource and Bain Capital and expect to -- that deal to close this summer. We'll also talk more about that a bit later.","So as we look back on 2013 for International Paper, I'm very pleased with our progress and the results, which did result in us exceeding our cost of capital for the fourth consecutive year.","Moving to our financial snapshot. I'm now on Slide 6. Revenue was up 4%, despite, I'd say, a challenging economic environment around the world. EBIT was up $400 million year-over-year and EPS increased by 19% to $3.16 a share. And as you can see on the slide, we had a significant increase in free cash flow year-over-year, up $200 million from $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion.","This next slide shows our history of return on invested capital. And as I said, this is the fourth year in a row of returns above our cost of capital.","Turning to Slide 8. International Paper's cash flow story and our free cash flow of $1.8 billion continued a strong trend of free cash flow results since 2008. I think its evidence that the company's results are less cyclical than they've been historically. And as we look to the future, we remain confident in the sustainable nature of our strong free cash flow. We also believe we can continue to grow it over time. Carol is going to cover the fourth quarter, but I'd say that we finished the year in terms of very strong free cash flow, almost $600 million in the fourth quarter, which is a run rate well in excess of $2 billion.","So turning to uses of cash, which we talk a lot about and all of you have an interest in. We've done what we said we would do. In 2013, we returned $1 billion to shareowners. In September, we increased the dividend for the second time since outlining our dividend policy in 2012. We also obtained authorization from our board to buy back $1.5 billion of stock. And as of yesterday, we purchased roughly $530 million of -- at an average price of just over $45 a share. We are taking advantage of the opportunity to buy back shares at prices we feel are below the intrinsic value of International Paper. And you can see the other major uses of cash that are consistent with our capital allocation strategy, which we shared with you.","So with that as a summary of 2013, I'll turn it over to Carol.","Carol L. Roberts","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report that we've met our commitment to reduce our debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 3x by the end of 2013. As John mentioned, we paid down balance sheet debt by $650 million. And we also saw our pension gap come down by $1.9 billion, which was a combination of strong asset performance, as well as an 80 basis points increase in the discount rate by year end.","We finished the year with a cash balance of $1.8 billion. So all of this puts us in very good shape from a balance sheet perspective for the foreseeable future.","Going to the next slide, taking a look at the financial bridge from '12 to '13. As John mentioned, we made solid progress on several fronts. Most notably in pricing, and that was largely driven by our efforts in our North American Industrial Packaging business. Volume was down slightly, and that was mostly in our Industrial Packaging business. And as I talk later, you'll see that our Industrial Packaging volume was in line with industry performance for the fourth quarter. So we closed the gap that we have had for most of the year.","Operations contributed very favorably to results. And the decision to rationalize capacity at both the #2 paper machine at Augusta and the Phase 1 of the Courtland shutdown was a headwind for the year of -- was $0.06.","Input costs in aggregate were up a little over $200 million year-over-year. That was about as we expected, but the makeup was probably a little bit different because it was largely driven by increased fiber cost in the second half of the year.","At Ilim, the cost of the project startups coupled with the noncash FX impact on the U.S. denominated debt negatively impacted EPS by $0.23.","So all in, 2013 was a strong year of progress and results, and we exited the year with a lot of momentum that's going to carry us into 2014.","Turning to the fourth quarter summary. As John mentioned, it was a very solid quarter, in which we generated our strongest free cash flow of the year with price improvements across all of our North American and Brazilian businesses. Our North American Industrial Packaging business delivered very strong results, finishing the year with industry-leading margins, and this was despite 2 less shipping days, seasonally lower demand that drove our decision to take 322,000 tons of downtime, of which 46,000 tons were maintenance related. The balance was taken to match our production to our customers' demand.","A very positive note was that for the first time since acquiring Temple-Inland, as I mentioned, our year-over-year box comp was equal to the industry, closing the gap on volume performance that we had seen since the acquisition, due to business that we shut through that process.","Overall, we saw a very encouraging demand trend from our customers through the fourth quarter. But as you know, we've had some very significant weather events in January, and this has impacted our ability to run and ship products. To date, this amounts to roughly 40,000 tons of lost production and customer demand through January and early February. But despite this setback, we do expect demand for the balance of the quarter to be consistent with the trend we saw in the fourth quarter.","We made good progress on the shutdown of Courtland and the transition of products across our North American Printing Papers system, and we'll talk a little bit more about that. And the project at our Ilim JV continues to ramp up, but we did see seasonally higher input costs, as well as some FX headwinds that masked the progress for the quarter.","Taking a look at the fourth quarter financial overview on Slide 13. We saw very good year-over-year improvement for the quarter really across the board, with EBITDA margins, as you can see, up 140 basis points. And all this culminated in very strong free cash flow for the quarter end and for the year.","So looking at the fourth quarter year-over-year, IP earned $0.83 per share versus $0.69 in the prior year. Pricing was up, driven largely by Industrial Packaging.","Overall, volume was flat, but the cost of the market-related downtime did negatively impact the quarter by $28 million. The rationalizations at Augusta and Courtland impacted the year-over-year results and input costs, mostly fiber, were up substantially.","Ilim FX and ramp-up costs were slightly unfavorable as well. And tax was unfavorable in the quarter in a year-over-year basis, due to a very unusually low tax rate that we saw in the fourth quarter of '12.","Interest rate -- our interest expense was favorable. And this was driven by a tax reserve reversal in the quarter, as well as lower interest expense, as we did pay down balance sheet debt throughout the year.","Miscellaneous year-end corporate items were favorable.","Moving on to Slide 15. Let me go down now and take you through the businesses. Starting with Industrial Packaging. In the fourth quarter of '13, we had a strong quarter, particularly considering the cost of the downtime that I mentioned that we chose to take to balance our system with 2 fewer shipping days and the seasonally lower demand that we see in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we took 276,000 tons of market-related downtime in the quarter, at a cost that we would estimate at about $35 million.","On the positive, we captured the final benefits of the spring box price increase, where we saw prices up $9 per ton from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, as we expected. That brings year-over-year box prices up $82 per ton. As I mentioned, we closed the year-over-year volume gap on boxes, but we did ship less containerboard exports in the fourth quarter.","Overall, our operations performed well. I would note that our EMEA Packaging results did fall short of our expectations, as we had hoped to realize about $10 million of margin relief through increased pricing in the face of increased board costs, but that did not materialize due to pretty competitive market conditions that continue to exist in our European business.","Turning to Slide 16. I just want to take a minute and put in perspective and highlight the tremendous success that we've had in our North American Industrial Packaging business. Not only have we grown this business in scale over the last several years through the 2 strategic acquisitions, but we steadily expanded the margins along the way. And this has resulted in 2013 as a $2.6 billion EBITDA business with 22% EBITDA margins in the year. So a lot of progress, and the exciting thing is there's more to come.","If I look on 17 in terms of the relative EBITDA margins in the North American Industrial Packaging business. Once again, we generated the best margins in industry despite the downtime associated with our actions to match our production to our customers' demand. The optimization opportunities that I referenced that we still have across this business coming off the 2 major acquisitions, just a really large systems, we believe, gives us further opportunity to expand our margins versus our key competitors.","Moving away from Industrial Packaging to the Consumer Packaging business on Slide 18. You can see that pricing was up year-over-year, as additional realization of the summer SBS increase benefited earnings in the quarter. Volume increased as well, and which is a great new story, driven by the improved demand as evidenced by the backlog that improved. And that really held throughout the second half of '13 and, we believe, carry into '14.","The quarter was impacted by 2 very large scheduled maintenance outages at our mills at Augusta and Texarkana.","If you look at the margins in this business, on 19, consequently, due to the outages that we experienced, the margins in the quarter were well below our average. Our full year margins though do remain 250 basis points above our key SBS competition.","Our outlook for '14 in our Consumer Packaging business is encouraging, given the fundamentals around backlog and demand that we believe will carry through. But I do need to mention, and we'll talk about it a little bit more, the business is going to be impacted in the first quarter by some very difficult weather conditions that we saw not only in early January but also we've experienced through the end of January and into early February.","Turning to the Printing Papers business. Earnings were virtually flat year-over-year, which I view as very favorable, given the impact of the Courtland shutdown and all the associated transition costs. The initial benefits of the North American cut-size increase began to come through and prices were up roughly $20 per ton as we exited the quarter. And at the time of this call, we fully implemented the October price increase and expect to realize increased prices of more than $50 per ton on all affected grades. This, along with increased prices in Brazil and India, enabled us to close the gap on pricing year-over-year, which I think is a very important and impressive accomplishment. Additionally, mix in the North American business improved in the quarter as we exited significantly lower-priced export volume. North American volume was down accordingly, but strong seasonal volume in Brazil and Europe offset these losses.","Talking about operations and costs. We were largely impacted by the Courtland shutdown, but we offset a bit of these costs by very strong operations in Franklin and Brazil. And we also benefited from the weaker Brazilian real, as margins expanded on our export volumes.","So all things considered, I would say a very good quarter for the papers business.","So giving a quick update on Slide 21 on the Courtland shutdown and the North American papers transition. First, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our colleagues -- all our colleagues at the Courtland mill. The shutdown is a significant event not only for the mill but for the community. And the team there has done an incredible job of handling what is a very difficult situation. I can't say strongly enough how proud we are of the team. And some good news, is many of our Courtland colleagues have been placed in open positions at our operations throughout the rest of the Southeast and in our other businesses, as well as in our papers business.","So as you know, the first 2 machines went down in November. All of the trials and qualifications at the others mills and with our customers have gone very well and are ahead of schedule. The costs we incurred in the fourth quarter were generally in line with what we expected. However, as I mentioned, we ran well across some of the other mills and managed spending very well to reduce the impact. As far as the plans for the balance of the mill, the team has accelerated the shutdown of the remaining 2 machines, both of which actually went down this past weekend. Due to the fact that we are shutting down the 2 largest machines, as well as the remainder of the mill, we will see the greatest amount of shutdown costs and impact in the first quarter. So for the first quarter, costs will be up -- or be $20 million more than in the fourth quarter. Now that's the peak. Thereafter, we expect costs in the second quarter to be half of the first quarter. And then there will be some residual costs that will continue into the third and fourth quarter of roughly $5 million to $10 million per quarter.","Turning to xpedx, Slide 22. Weaker demand across the printing and facility solution segment led to a challenging quarter for the business. The great news is, as John mentioned earlier, we're very excited about concluding the definitive agreement phase of the pending transaction. And I want to take a couple of minutes and recap where we are on that.","So turning to Slide 23. We signed a merger agreement with Unisource last week. And we're working on the registration statements for the SEC review process, which we expect to file in the coming weeks. As we announced last Tuesday, the IP shareholders will own 51% of the new company and IP will receive a cash dividend from NewCo of $400 million at the time of the spin. This will be a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, which will be tax-free to IP and its shareholders, pending IRS approval.","IP has the potential to receive an additional cash earn-out of up to $100 million in 2020, if certain conditions are met. And with the exit of xpedx from IP, IP's overall margin and return on invested capital will increase.","Regarding funding for the new company. NewCo has received bank commitments for asset-backed financing of $1.4 billion. But it is expected to carry an additional debt load of roughly $800 million and an initial debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4 to 5x, which, of course, will be expected to reduce over time as synergies are realized and EBITDA increases.","xpedx currently has total net assets of roughly $700 million to $800 million, of which approximately $100 million are fixed assets, all of which will follow the spin to NewCo. Of course, more information will be available, including xpedx and Unisource financials and NewCo pro-formas, once the registration statement is filed.","Turning our attention to Ilim on Slide 24. The JV realized continued progress on the ramp-up of the major capital projects with the paper machine at Koryazhma and the pulp line at Bratsk. However, this was more than offset by seasonally higher energy and wood costs. Additionally, earnings were further impacted unfavorably due to the continued devaluation of the Russian ruble and the resulting net unfavorable noncash FX impact on the JV's $1.4 billion of U.S.-denominated debt.","Slide 24 provides a view of where the JV is in its current ramp-up relative to historical results and its potential given the expanded capacity capability. So let me walk through this slide. The top -- the table at the top outlines how depreciation and interest expense have changed as a result of the capital project and associated debt. You can see that prior to the projects, depreciation was averaging $125 million per year. And that post-project, depreciation has increased to approximately $225 million annually. Similarly, interest expense has increased from the pre-project level of $15 million to about $75 million annually.","Now the bottom chart illustrates where the JV is in the ramp-up of EBITDA. It's important to note that both FX and pulp prices in particular are highly variable. So for both the '14 estimate and the fully ramped potential target is assuming stable FX and pulp prices at today's level. So you can see the fully ramped-up potential is $150 million to $200 million higher than the 4 year average that occurred prior to the project construction startup.","2013 was significantly impacted by the projects, although you can see, we did make progress in the second half of the year. So not meaning to be too particular here, but taking EBITDA, subtracting depreciation and interest, tax affecting the results and dividing by 2 for IP shares gives you a pretty good approximation for the equity earnings for International Paper. And clearly, we expect a better year from the JV in 2014, and more importantly, considerable upside for the future.","So turning to 26 and looking ahead to the first quarter. We expect seasonally lower volume in Brazil and Europe, along with a coated paperboard project that we're doing at Kwidzyn that will impact volume and the full shutdown at Courtland. These things will more than offset the benefit of the 2 additional shipping days in North American packaging.","Additionally, it's currently estimated that the severe weather events throughout the month of January and into February will impact volume by 40,000 tons, primarily across our Packaging businesses.","Pricing will continue to improve with full implementation of the fourth quarter North American cut-size price increase. Additionally, we'll see further mix improvements across our North American papers business, as the Courtland transition continues. And we do expect some mix improvement across North American Industrial Packaging as well, driven by higher volume of boxes as a percent of our total volume. We also expect some modest benefit on pricing in Brazil papers as well.","Moving to ops. I highlighted the expected costs at Courtland, which is a large item in the quarter but we do expect some good progress at Orsa, offset by the impact of the Kwidzyn project. Additionally, the severe weather has impacted many of our mill operations in the South.","Input costs in the quarter will be significant, driven largely by the extreme temperatures across much of the U.S., both in terms of unit pricing and consumption. Under normal circumstances, input costs would have been up seasonally in the quarter probably around $20 million. But on top of that, we estimate the incremental impact of the weather could be as much as $30 million. We also have a big outage quarter with in incremental costs over the fourth quarter of $47 million.","Earlier, I provided an update on the Ilim JV, along with an outlook for '14. We will continue to ramp up, and that's going well into '14. We typically try not to forecast changes in FX, but I feel like I should point out that the ruble has weakened fairly significantly over the last month. And so had we ended the quarter January 31, the negative FX EPS impact would have been around $0.10.","So moving to 27. In summary, we exited '13 with a lot of momentum. However, we are dealing with some temporary headwinds that will impact the first quarter. But that does not diminish our view of the full year potential, as John's going to discuss in a moment. The most immediate significant impact that we should be beyond shortly is the severe winter weather, which we estimate will impact the first quarter earnings by $40 million to $50 million. We will realize price improvement in North American papers and pulp, as well as in our Brazilian business on previously announced increases. And last week, we announced additional price increases in North American papers, pulp and coated paperboard, as well as Brazil paper and packaging, being effective with March.","Volume will increase with more shipping days in North America. However, we talked about the impact of the winter storms has been significant and will offset at least half of this benefit. And as we talked about, the continuation of the shutdown at Courtland will impact cost and volume in the quarter.","As we mentioned, we do have an increase in quarter-over-quarter maintenance outages as well. Energy costs will be significantly higher, both due to seasonality, as well as weather impacts. But these will moderate by the end of Q1.","Finally, we expect to pay cash taxes at levels closer to book taxes and the interest benefit result in the fourth quarter will not repeat.","So with that, let me turn it back over to John, so he can speak to the full year outlook and wrap up.","John V. Faraci","Okay, Carol, thanks. Let's turn our attention now looking forward to 2014 and the bigger global picture. I'm on Slide 28, the map. This slide shows the most current collective outside view of year-over-year changes in GDP in the major regions around the world that we operate. So sitting here early in the year, recognizing it's early, the macro environment from my perspective actually looks and feels somewhat better than it is as we exited 2013.","Demand is modestly better, although it's hard to see, given the recent widespread weather disruptions in North America that Carol talked about. So the bottom line as we look forward to 2014, we're not counting on a lot of help from North America or global economies, but we see global group GDP inching up. If North American global GDP and demand are better, that's a good strong tailwind for us.","But internally, I think this is important, we have many levers to pull, which are within our control, which will meaningfully impact results this year. And I'd like to highlight a couple of them. In North America, we have a large opportunity within our Industrial Packaging business for optimization. In Industrial Packaging, we've been very busy integrating 2 large acquisitions over the last 5 years and we haven't had a chance to optimize the combined business, which has grown from $4 billion to over $12 billion. The optimization opportunities are significant. They're around system integration, commercial and portfolio decisions, cost-reduction opportunities that are unique to International Paper because of these 2 acquisitions and best practices sharing. There's a significant opportunity with the emerging trend in our Coated Paperboard business and Foodservice for customers to move away from foam cups to paper cups. Companies like McDonald's have already made that decision. That's going to benefit our Foodservice business and our Coated Paperboard paper business.","We talked a lot about Courtland, and the repositioning of the papers business is well underway. The end result, when we get to the back end of next year, is a smaller, a better and more cost-efficient footprint for our Printing Paper business in North America.","Outside North America, we have projects at Ilim and synergy opportunities at Orsa that we didn't get in 2013 at the Brazil packaging business.","At Kwidzyn, Poland, we're completing -- we'll complete it this quarter a coated paperboard project that will enable IP to enhance and improve our product offering to customers and expand our margins at one of our best facilities in the world.","So a lot of things that we've got going on internally that are independent of the macro environment.","So let me move to the next slide here and just give kind of a high-level financial outlook for 2014. Overall, we expect another meaningful increase in EBITDA results of roughly 10% in 2014 over 2013. As a result, free cash flow generation should approach $2 billion. This will enable International Paper to return a significant amount of cash to shareowners through our recently increased dividend and the share buyback program, which we have underway. We've been very active and opportunistic.","As we've previously highlighted, we'll continue to have more runway with the dividend as we generate these results, and we'll be evaluating our dividend as the year progresses.","We'll also make a contribution to pension fund of approximately $450 million. And we'll continue to evaluate investment opportunities that have the potential to create significant value for our shareowners. With the expected proceeds from the xpedx spend, our cash position is strong as is the outlook.","So let me wrap up things and then we'll open up for questions. As Carol said -- I'm on the picture now that shows the -- an interstate highway in Atlanta, I think, a week ago. January and the first couple of days of February have been a challenge. And I think this picture sums it up. We've got a temporary hiccup in terms of higher costs, lost production, lost sales. But importantly, the truck there isn't upside down, it's just sideways. So I think we're going to get beyond this, and 2014 certainly looks like a significantly better year for International Paper on top of a good year -- good solid year in 2013, even with January hopefully behind us.","So in summary, 2013 was a strong year progress results for IP, we move into '14 with a lot of internal initiatives. We expect solid growth and EBITDA and free cash flow and EPS for the year.","I think IP is better positioned than ever to achieve the results that, frankly, should be records for -- on a number of fronts. And in 2014, we're going to take another significant step toward our near-term goal of achieving over $5 billion of EBITDA, $2.2 billion free cash flow.","So with that, operator, I'll turn it back to you and we'll open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I jumped on the call a little bit late, so I apologize if you already discussed this. But with uncoated freesheet, can you comment, John or Carol, what percentage of your volume is the current level of pricing increase in the market that you just announced impacting? And when you're done with all of the Courtland-related realignment, how much volume do you expect to return back to the market?","John V. Faraci","George, Tim Nicholls will kind of take that.","Timothy S. Nicholls","The first price increase, it was not on 100% of the volume. There were some branded products that were not included, but it was a solid 80-plus percent of our capacity product lines. And in the month of January, we have completed implementation of that increase. So it was a little bit -- through the fourth quarter, price increase and the numbers that we're showing also include the export impact, which was down in the quarter. But in North America, we saw prices move up 20 through the quarter. And then for the month of January, we completed the increase.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. But on the March increase, how much of your volume is that impacting? Is that 100%, 20%?","Timothy S. Nicholls","No. It's 100%.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","100%?","Timothy S. Nicholls","100%. And so on the March increase, we're up $70 on all of our commodity grades and $40 on branded products...","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And how much volume do you think, when we're all is said and done, will you have returned to the market from where you were prior to the Courtland announcement, if you can talk to that?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Well, we announced capacity and we're shutting down 765,000 tons of uncoated freesheet capacity out of Courtland. And at this point, all the machines are down. So there was close to 1 million tons total, including coated. There's basis weight changes. There's a number of puts and takes. But it's going to be in that 750,000 ton range.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, the last thing, and I will turn it over, can you comment at all on the industrial side what type of -- I know the weather is having an effect here. But what kind of start to the quarter are you seeing on a volume basis year-on-year? And I know talking about economic downtime is difficult. But can you comment, as you sit here today, what economic downtime you might have given your current operating profile?","Mark Stephan Sutton","This is Mark Sutton. On the demand question. You're right, the weather interruptions kind of masked what we're seeing. But I'll tell you, before we got into the weather, we were pleased with the way the volume profile was developing in the U.S. box business. And actually, after the first weather event, we were headed toward offsetting that. The second round of activity is, as Carol described earlier, we're just not sure about. But it will be a temporary issue. We'll put it behind us. But when we looked at our fourth quarter and we looked at the way December unfolded for us and for the market, we're actually on the positive side of sentiment for volume. And as you know, and you can look at the numbers that we put in the appendix charts, there is a seasonality to the market demand. There's also a seasonality, obviously, to International Paper's demand. There's also a seasonality to our capacity that we create by managing our maintenance outages. So we really need to run our system very well through the first couple of quarters of this year, given the amount of maintenance outages and other planned activities we have. So we have really have to execute very well going forward.","John V. Faraci","Let's say that looking at the GDP numbers, if we get a continuation of what we saw in the third and fourth quarter, we're going to have a positive, better box demand market than we had last year, which is basically flat. If we're at 3% GDP, we're not going to have a flat box market like we saw in 2013. So I think that's reason to be quite positive on how the year is going to play out. I mean, it's early on, but the macro data is not blowing out but it's incrementally better.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Two quick ones. First of all, Tim, on the uncoated freesheet, can you give us a sense as to how much of the first initiative at the end of the day you were able to bring through?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes. We feel like we had a full realization, Mark. We -- as I was saying, we had about $20 in the quarter but we finished up the rest of the implementation in January. So as we exit January on the $60 increase from last year, we felt like we had a full realization.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Great. And then second, Carol and John, you both made several references to portfolio optimization in containerboard -- improving profitability in containerboard. Any chance you could give us a little bit more in the way of targets and timing?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Mark, we have talked before around the optimization that John referenced, at least the initial line of sight, to being $200 million. And we said as we entered '14 that would be a multiyear program. And we think a big portion of that, we think, we'll be able to realize in the coming couple of years. However, we're not done looking, and optimization is a general term. But it really is about making this business the best it can be and helping all components of the business reach its potential. And we're still discovering new opportunities, as John said, now that we're finished with the integration and synergy -- early synergy acquisition activities.","John V. Faraci","And very different situation running a $12 billion business versus a $4 billion business with the number of facilities, the segments we've got, the options we have and not a lot of that stuff is going to be big capital project related. So we're pretty positive that we got a lot of opportunity to mine here over the next couple of years.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First on the North American industrials business. Can you talk about how your inventories moved through the fourth quarter? And how do you anticipate to manage inventories through the first quarter, especially given the significant downtime that you expect to take during the quarter?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Alex, our inventories through the fourth quarter trended down, which is what we planned for. It's very difficult to forecast customer demand too far out, given the nature of our customers' business, so a lot of just-in-time. But we believe we're set up well for what we need in the first quarter from a demand standpoint but also, referencing my earlier comment, from our own supply profile, given our annual outages start in the first and second quarter. So we feel real good about our inventory levels. It's something we manage very closely. We've got a lot of new tools to be able to do it now that our recently acquired mills that we got from Temple are all on the same supply chain system as the other legacy mills. And so we're really starting to work at optimizing that. But we feel good about the inventory we have. We're going to make the board that we need for the customer demand we have and the service level we need to provide.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on the pension contribution, do you already know what quarter you expect -- what quarter during 2014 you expect to make the contribution in?","Carol L. Roberts","Alex, this is Carol. We'll put it in throughout the year, it won't go in all at one time and it will pretty much meter in fairly evenly throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman from UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It looks like you took a couple of charges both, I guess, for some restructuring in Asian packaging, as well as India. I was just wondering if you could talk about those specifically and then maybe more broadly what you're seeing in the specific markets?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes. Gail, you're referring to the special items?","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes.","Carol L. Roberts","Yes. So on the special items, we did take a charge. We wrote off the goodwill that we had in India. And so that's pretty straightforward. And then we had a small business in the box business over there that we closed. It wasn't corrugated, it was another packaging business that just was eluding money and not productive, so we took that down.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Just more broadly what you're seeing in India and China?","John V. Faraci","I'd say Gail, I'll let Tom Kadien comment. Both India and China feel like they -- in China's case, the car was driving 80 miles an hour, now it's 60 miles an hour. It feels slower but it's still pretty fast growth. And India is probably the same thing from a -- at a slightly lower number. But they're still large markets that are going to grow and their economies are growing, but at a slower rate than they were in 2012 and '13.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Gail, this is Tom. The box business in 2013 and in the fourth quarter in China is growing at about 4%, so that's much improved. We feel like we've got our hands wrapped around that. The business that we shut down was an expanded polystyrene foam inner packaging operation. So we're really at a point where we see the box business starting to get some -- get its legs underneath it and starting to grow. In India, we've struggled with really wood cost increases throughout the year. And as we exit '13, those wood costs have started to flatten out. And we're still selling everything we can make and we're seeing productivity improvement, so we expect an improved '14 in India.","John V. Faraci","If you think about that 4% growth, that's -- on a 40 million ton market, that's 1.6 million tons of boxes a year. And if you do the math, it's a lot of volume.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just quickly on domestic markets. The wood cost inflation you've seen over the last few quarters, to what extent do you see that as weather related that could come back? Or do you think it's more structural with recovering OSD markets and energy demand?","John V. Faraci","I think the spike we saw, Gail, is all weather related. It was mostly on hardwood, not in pine, which is where the OSB stuff is going to show up. And it's amazing with no tropical storms or hurricanes hitting the East Coast -- I think I got this right, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina had the highest rainfall in over 100 years. And we have a lot of mills running along that coast that got impacted, Riegelwood, Georgetown, Eastover, Augusta, Savannah. So we see it as temporary. It's going to take a while to work that down, but it's -- I think it's peaked.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions on the offshore businesses. First, it seems like the pace of the Ilim ramp-up has been a bit disappointing, particularly in light of how strong that softwood pulp market has been. Can you just discuss the reasons for the kind of delayed ramp-up at Ilim?","John V. Faraci","Well, let me give you a couple of numbers, Mark, kind of put that into perspective because yes, it did go a little slower than we thought. But this is the project that, first of all, is done. It's completed. That's a milestone because projects like this in that part of the world always don't get completed. And we made 66,000 tons in the third quarter, 105,000 tons in the fourth quarter. And in January, we produced 36,000 tons, which -- that run rate is twice what the fourth quarter was. So we're starting to come up pretty quickly. We're probably a quarter behind in terms of -- but that's behind us, I'm looking ahead. And with the progress we made in January both on the volume side, the quality side and the cost side, there's a lot of positive runway there. But it's -- they were complicated projects, Mark. Operating in Siberia in the winter with the number of people we had to mobilize and the number of project management people we have from around the world cycling in and out in a very tough environment wasn't easy. But with our partner -- we could have done it without a partner. We proved we could do it. And then Koryazhma, I'd say that's a different story. We're -- in January, we were on the CIP, that's our capital project run rate of 200,000 tons. So we're right there in terms of uncoated freesheet production. And we're already -- I think we've made 700 tons of coated papers. So when that project is fully balanced out, we'd have 130,000 tons of uncoated freesheet and 70,000 tons of coated paper. But that's running -- that's the machine we moved from Scotland from Inverurie. That's running at its capacity already. Now we got to optimize the cost and get the quality and all that stuff down. But we're qualified on branded cut-size.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And the other offshore piece I wondered about John was just Orsa down in Brazil. I think your EBITDA margin was 9%. If I look at the numbers that both Klabin and Rigesa put up, they're 2 to 3x that level, maybe even close to 4x in Klabin's case. What's kind of a reasonable target and reasonable time line down at Orsa? You've now - you've been in there for about a year, you must have a pretty good sense.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Mark, it's Tim. Part of the problem was we got hit with some onetime accounting charges at the end of the quarter. The underlying business we saw improve, the first couple of months of the quarter, our margins had moved back up into the mid-teens, 16%, 17%. And then we had a bit part of that wiped out in the last month of the quarter. My view is we still have a business that can earn in the mid-20s. And we'll see a meaningful change in performance this year. Part of what we dealt with last year, we got squeezed on OCC. We've now caught up to that on the price side. And quite frankly, we found out that we had to spend more on maintenance in some of the facilities than we thought we were going to have to. We think we've got that mostly behind us now, too. So price has moved in the right direction. Volume has moved in the right direction, and I think we'll run better. We've gotten these onetime accounting charges behind us. So I think 2014 will see a meaningful improvement.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So to get to kind of the mid-20s, Tim, do you have a sense of how long that will take you? And how much incremental capital that might involve?","Timothy S. Nicholls","I don't think it's going to take a whole lot of capital. The capital that we're spending is on smaller items. It's about automation in some facilities. It's about getting -- quite frankly, getting people out of facilities. They've thrown a lot of labor at the operations for a long time. So in terms of the forecast on when we get to the mid-20s, there's a lot of puts and takes there. I think we'll be -- we'll take a meaningful step towards that this year, and we'll see what 2015 brings.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Carol, first question for you. Just to be clear, on the $2 billion-ish free cash flow number that you are putting out for 2014, that is before the pension contributions, is that right?","Carol L. Roberts","That's correct, Chip.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, okay, just want to be clear. And then when you look at the -- at Ilim, this is a quick follow-up -- it was very helpful to have that slide with the sort of the long-term guidance, and you say the equity income number would be $100 million to $120 million at current prices. Is sort of the right ratio to think about every $10 a ton might be another $10 million or $0.01 a ton -- or $1 a ton is $1 million? And the way I'm getting there is, I believe, the combined tonnage at the 2 mills there is about 2.5 million tons and, obviously, your equity ownership in that is about half of that. So if you think about it, if you got a $10 ton increase, you would get something on the order of magnitude of $10 million or $12 million. Is that pretty much the way to look at it?","Carol L. Roberts","That feels about right.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, got it. And last quick one on Ilim. You mentioned the $0.10 hit from currency. Is that -- if I heard you right, that's taking into account the ruble decline from the, I guess, the end of the year to where it stood yesterday?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes. I normally wouldn't comment on that, but it is depreciated pretty significantly through the month of January. So since we're on the call, I thought I would take an opportunity to point that out. You need to take a look at that as the quarter progresses.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Two questions. If we try to look past the messy first quarter, your overall input cost outlook is stable. I'm curious how that breaks down because we're hearing from others that chemical and labor could be a headwind. RISI has OCC trending up. So I wonder if you could just share with us how that input cost ends up stable in your view. And that's all I got.","Carol L. Roberts","Yes. This is Carol. Actually, if we just -- if you look at Slide 30, we talked about input cost inflation in the $175 million to $200 million range for the full year. So we didn't really talk about it as stable. I think what we were -- maybe I'm not quite sure which part, but maybe referring to the fact that there's a spike in the first quarter on gas, and that will come back down to a more reasonable level. Now that's just input cost. We do have other inflation that happens. And then our goal is to have our initiative to offset that type of inflation through our productivity initiative that we have across the company.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay, that's actually very helpful. Sorry, I'm misreading your comments a little bit. That's all.","Carol L. Roberts","I'm glad you clarified.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","In terms of your EBITDA guidance of 10% increase. What do you guys baking in, in terms of price? I know you've announced a few price increases across your portfolio. So I just want to get a sense on that front.","John V. Faraci","We do not get -- try to forecast prices here because we can't and we shouldn't. So I'd say, we've got some price increase momentum that's been talked about, as we've mentioned taking the questions, going through the presentation. So we feel pretty good that we've got a line of sight to that kind of increase with plans we have in place.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then John, I mean, you guys are going to get a lot of free cash flow in 2014 going forward and you got some cash coming in from the xpedx divestiture. Just from a high level, some of your acquisitions and some of your investments -- recent investments on the international front, you've seen somewhat mixed results. Are you kind of looking at the hurdle rates a little differently going forward? And how should we be thinking about that front?","John V. Faraci","So we do have higher hurdle rates when we're investing in parts of the world that are outside the developed markets. And we're not going to make investments unless they meet our hurdle rates. So we're disciplined about that.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one last quick one for Tom. The Sun JV actually turned positive from a profitability standpoint. Is that kind of good bogey going forward? Or is there some potential headwinds we've got to account for going forward?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Philip, the JV is seeing improved results. I'd say the market in China for coated board, demand is pretty good, probably a little bit better than we expected. Pricing is moving sideways but the improvement that you're seeing is really as we improve our mix at the joint venture and we sell more of the higher priced value-added grades, and fewer of the, I'll call, more commodity or folding carton end of the spectrum. So that's the improvement you see, and we think that's sustainable and will continue to move.","John V. Faraci","And I guess, as I -- just thinking about your comment about investments outside North America, our biggest investments are in Brazil and Russia. Brazil's got 30% EBITDA margins. We've had 2 years of consecutive EBITDA improvement. We're generating a lot of cash. We had some currency headwinds down there when the real was strengthening, which were hurting our returns, but now our returns are getting better. We've got a great market position in that part of the world. So we're very pleased with our investment in Brazil. We'll get the Packaging business right. And in Russia, which is probably our second largest offshore investment, IP Russia, which is our paper business, is well above cost of capital returns, well above our hurdle rate. And we think Ilim is going to turn out to be a fabulous investment now that we've got this big capital projects behind us. So we've got some challenges in India and China, no question about it, for different reasons. But where our big offshore investments are -- and I haven't even talked about Europe, our paper business in Europe continues to perform very well and returning well above cost of capital returns. So I don't really see it that we've had -- we've struggled with the emerging market investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question on uncoated freesheet. In recent months, we've maybe seen a little bit stronger volumes than some of us had expected. And I'm wondering, as you forecast 2014 demand, understanding you have a capacity adjustment, but can you tell us what level of industry demand you're expecting for North America? And is there any reason to think that demand might be a little bit stronger than the kind of the 3% decline that a lot of us plug into our models?","Timothy S. Nicholls","This is Tim. Yes, I think there is reason to believe it might be stronger. Most of the forecasts that are out there are still between 3% and 4%, but I think they'll be updating it based on how last year ended. There's probably a little bit of pull-forward in December. But if you look at the underlying economy, we see an increase in white-collar workers. We also see an increase in consumption of paper per white-collar worker. It had been on kind of a downward trend and as you look at 2013, it leveled out, maybe even ticked up a little bit. Commercial print indices were up. Even mill volume last year performed better than expected. So if the economy continues to improve, I believe that there is potentially a modest help on the demand decline for this year.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just switching to containerboard. Can you confirm that the process of shedding some of the less attractive Temple-Inland business has basically run its course? And then, you referenced the 40,000 tons of lost production in January, primarily in packaging. Can -- should we assume that, that's basically just lost production? Or is it possible that you might get some of that back in February?","Mark Stephan Sutton","So Anthony, on the first question, I think we have really ended the shed of business that was related to acquiring and integrating Temple. And as Carol mentioned, we've really pretty much closed the gap with our performance versus the market, which was an objective of ours, and we saw progress throughout the year. On the 40,000 tons in January, a portion of that is probably going to come back. It's hard to tell how much because of the segments that you would say demand wouldn't get destroyed, it's just delayed. But for example, if it was demand in the restaurant industry and people couldn't get to a restaurant to go out to eat because of the roads or weather, it's up in the air whether they go out to eat twice later. So we're going to track it closely. But I think it'll be a mix of maybe lost demand and demand that comes back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Al Kabili of Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Either John or Carol, could you just help us quantify on the weather impact? The $40 million to $50 million, it's quite a bit more above than would be implied by the 40,000 ton production issue you mentioned in January. So is that the remainder mostly costs on a nat gas side that's driving that? Or do you see other sizable volume headwinds elsewhere in the business driving that view on the headwind?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes. I think it's a combination. It's definitely natural gas. Natural gas is probably a good $20 million of that, maybe 20 plus. I mean, the gas, it's spiked and it's staying off it, so the gas prices that we're seeing at least through February are much higher than what we had anticipated. Now natural gas responds pretty quickly, so it should get better. The other one is just the consumption in the mills of everything we use because it's been so cold. And we have had disruptions in operations. They're costly when that happens. So it's kind of a combination of all of the above. Volume being one piece.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, I guess, a question, Mark, to the degree that box volumes stay flat for the remainder of the year, which has been the trend the last few years. Are you comfortable with the capacity and the size of the IP mills and\/or box footprint?","Mark Stephan Sutton","I think, Al, on the assumption that volume stays flat, which we don't believe that's the long-term trend. But on that assumption, if you look at our current capacity footprint in containerboard and the seasonality that we described both on the demand side and the supply side, we like the footprint we have. You got to remember a couple of things. Every mill is not created equal. So some mills make linerboards, some make medium, some make both. There are lightweight and heavyweight products. And so a mix of recycled mills and virgin mills in our fleet allow us to flex our capacity in a pretty cost-effective way. And I think for the box system, we've done a number of rationalizations. There's still more to do that will fall under the category of optimization. But we like the North American box footprint we have. And I'll remind you that we have a multichannel strategy in our business. The North American box business that we own and operate is very important. But we're also an important player in the open market with very good customers in the domestic open market. And we also have a very meaningful strategic long-term position in containerboard export markets throughout the world. And those work in unison to really optimize our revenue line and our EBITDA margins, and we'll continue to do that.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. A final follow-up question for me to you is just how are you feeling about the additional optimization opportunity in the business? And does volumes appreciably change the ramp or your view at all on how that ramps up the next few years?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Al, I think volume definitely helps. If saw north of 1% it allows you to do some of the optimization activities maybe a little quicker. But when we talk about optimization, John mentioned that we're talking really about improving what we have that's unique to IP. So it's a mix of commercial activities, service offerings and, of course, on the cost side. Volume would definitely help give you a firmer foundation to work on that. But one thing that I did neglect to mention in your first question around the capacity is that we are still, as you know, buying a certain amount of containerboard from the 3 mills that we divested. And obviously, as we can see our way to make some of that board ourselves, we recapture that margin as well. So that's got to play out as we think about what our real permanent long-term capacity footprint is going to look like.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two quick ones on international. Can you provide a little bit more color on what you are doing in Kwidzyn? Obviously, it's a great mill and you make a lot of money in Poland. And how that project helps you further penetrate the market? And then just on the, I'm guessing, it was Andhra Pradesh, the goodwill write-down, I know you said, Carol, it was pretty straightforward, but what triggered that?","John V. Faraci","Well, the project at Kwidzyn, George, is really about making a higher-end grade of coated paperboard. We'll make a little more volume, but basically, we'll move up the quality scale and be -- compete in some segments that are growing segments in Europe. And Kwidzyn is one of our crown jewels. It's one of the best mills we have in the world. We're making great returns there. And we want to keep that facility kind of at the forefront. And it makes uncoated freesheet, also makes coated paperboard. Just to comment about APPM. We knew when we bought APPM, we paid a full price and it was really kind of the price you had to pay to get into the market to learn the market and figure out whether International Paper could be successful there, both in paper and maybe eventually in packaging. And we just -- so that premium price was really expressed as goodwill, and we came to the conclusion that the proper thing to do is write it off, but we knew we paid that premium when we bought it.","Operator","And we have reached the allotted time for questions today.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jay Royalty, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Jay Royalty","Thanks, Tamika. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are John Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter 2013 earnings press release in today's presentation slides.","Lastly, given our expanded disclosure around our Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Faraci.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everybody. During the next 15 to 20 minutes, Carol and I will review our third quarter results and performance of individual businesses, then I'll speak to our outlook and will open it up to your questions.","So for the quarter, International Paper delivered record operating earnings of $471 million or $1.05 a share. That was driven by continued margin expansion and very solid operations around the world in our manufacturing businesses. In spite of much higher wood costs due to the wettest weather we've had in the Southeast in over 100 years, we've got meaningful improvement in our North American Industrial Packaging business, and also a price improvement as well in our North American Coated Board business. We also got some price improvements in pulp, although it started a little bit later in the quarter than we expected, but it's going to flow through into our fourth quarter. And we announced price increases in our North American paper business and expect to see implementation beginning in the fourth quarter.","We successfully executed $80 million of outages and saw a very significant progress in the ramp-up of the new capacity and capabilities in our Ilim joint venture in 2 of the facilities where we made major capital investments.","And finally, in the quarter, we had late-breaking favorable development on the tax front, which resulted in a one-time benefit of $30 million, reducing our tax rate to 24%. But even without that tax -- that tax adjustment, the third quarter, from an operating earnings standpoint, was an all-time record for International Paper. Free cash flow continues to be generated at solid levels, and we see good momentum going into 2014.","The run rate free cash flow for the last 2 quarters, which Carol will talk about, was $1.8 billion.","All in, another milestone quarter for International Paper, taking a big step on our journey to becoming a stronger and more valuable company that creates value for our customers and our investors.","So let me just quickly go to the financial highlights on the next slide. Sales were up 6%. Margins expanded by 160 basis points. EBITDA improvement of 12% or $100 million, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And as I said, an all-time record even without the tax benefit.","So with that, let me turn over to Carol to take a closer look at the quarter, and then I'll come back and talk about the outlook.","Carol L. Roberts","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As John said, IP delivered its strongest EPS quarter in nearly 2 decades, with the highest EBITDA and operating earnings in our history. The quarter benefited from strong price improvement, solid operational performance and good progress in the ramp-up of the Ilim projects.","In the quarter, volume was slightly lower due to one less shipping day in North America, and we did have seasonally lower demand in our North American Industrial Packaging business. Maintenance outages were positive, as this was our lightest maintenance outage quarter for the year.","Input costs were a headwind, particularly wood, due to the extremely wet weather in the Southeast U.S., which did significantly impact our Printing Papers business and it impacted also our Coated Board business. On the corporate side, we saw a one-time benefit of $13 million, due to the release of a tax reserve in the quarter, which as I said, helped interest. The tax benefit that John mentioned contributed $30 million or $0.08 to our results. And this tax benefit was associated with the recent U.S. court case decision that involved another taxpayer similar to us, and it provides for an increase in the tax basis for certain fixed assets.","John mentioned it, the quarter-over-quarter improvement in the Ilim JV contributed very favorably to our results. The operations were better, and I'm going to talk about that, but we also did see a gain in the FX associated with the strengthening of the ruble against the U.S. dollar-denominated debt on the JV's balance sheet.","So moving to input costs. We did experience a significant headwind relative to fiber cost increase, and that was mostly wood in our North American operations. On the second quarter call, we mentioned that we expected some headwind on wood cost, although not nearly to the degree to which it did unfold. We updated this outlook at the UBS conference in September. Fortunately, the weather situation has moderated since then. That said, it was still a big cost increase in the quarter and we do expect carryover into the fourth quarter as we enter what would be seasonally the normal higher-cost winter months, with somewhat relatively low inventory, than we are attempting to rebuild our inventories as we go.","Now turning to the businesses. Let me first cover Industrial Packaging, which delivered record earnings, as well as the price increase in North American box came through roughly $30 per ton on average for the quarter. Within this record performance, our EMEA Packaging business did have weaker earnings due to a margin squeeze there experienced, as box prices, which they're increasing, are trailing behind on some Containerboard increases that have happened. And, all-in-all, we like the Containerboard increases and we'll take on the challenge of raising our box prices in Europe.","As I mentioned previously, volume was lighter due to one less shipping day in the quarter, and it is seasonally slower demand for us. The second quarter is a very big quarter for us, with the agricultural mix, but still a very solid quarter. Operations were very good, and some of those operations were offset by some one-time costs.","And as I said, we did see some input cost headwinds in North America as well in the form of increased wood and OCC costs. The next slide, Slide 10, really shows a great story. We saw benefits on pricing improvement and solid operations, and that created further EBITDA margin expansion in our North American Industrial Packaging business. And we continue to fare very well against our key public competitors.","We should continue to see strong results in this area as we finalize the full realization of the announced price increase in the fourth quarter and drive our optimization improvements into 2014 and beyond.","Moving to the pricing realization. And so relative to the conclusion of the American -- North American box price increased efforts, we continued to see very strong results in this area and we actually exceeded the plan we laid out earlier in the year. As I mentioned earlier, we saw box price increases rise on average of $30 per ton in the third quarter. And we exited the quarter at a run rate in the high $40 range. We expect roughly $5 per ton more in Q4. And so as we move through the quarter, we will fully recover more than the $50 Containerboard increase. So a very strong success in this area.","Turning to the next slide. When you look at our North American Packaging business, we truly feel that we're uniquely positioned to continue to realize benefits and improvements. We've spoken to this opportunity before, and I want to emphasize it again, that we have an opportunity to optimize this large-scale business that we've built in a number of areas: operations, supply chain, our commercial efforts. And this can contribute additionally about $200 million of EBITDA to the bottom line.","We're well positioned with low-cost assets that can continue to improve. We have untapped capacity at our Valliant, Oklahoma mill that could ramp-up quickly and very cost effectively and at the right time. We've got a great portfolio, an attractive portfolio of customers that we can continue to upgrade as we work our mix. We have a strategic mix of virgin and recycled mill capabilities that enable us to effectively serve a broad range of markets, both domestically and across the globe. And we embrace the strategy to manage our supply to our customers' demand, and that will allow us also to meet those -- that demand at the lowest delivered cost.","And finally, we're also seeing the opportunity to leverage our global Industrial Packaging footprint as we expand our reach into markets around the globe. That's everything from best practice sharing to global and multinational customers and segments. And that represents just a few of the potential opportunities that we have in front of us.","So moving from Industrial Packaging, let me talk about the Consumer Packaging business. As we look at our Consumer Packaging business, we saw some price improvements in our North American business, and we had a big step-up due to no outages in the third quarter. Our European business continues to perform well, and we continue to see good momentum in North America as backlogs remained strong and price increases continued to be implemented.","Relative to our Foodservice business, turning to the next slide. There were some nice and important developments relating to this business in the quarter, as key customers and potential customers publicly announced intentions to move away from foam-based cups to paper cups. McDonald's announced their plan to convert to paper hot cups in all of their 14,000 plus locations in the U.S.. A McDonald's representative cited customers' changing preferences and increased recyclability as the driver for this change, and they expect a multiyear transition that will extend probably through 2016.","In the case of Dunkin, they moved to paper in their Brookline Mass. stores in response to anti-foam legislation. And they stated, they're looking for a solution to replace foam that meets the goals for cost performance and recyclability. These 2 opportunities alone would result in 3 billion to 4 billion cups in increased demand, and that would translate to roughly 80,000 tons of paper cup stocks, which is great for us, as we're very well positioned to benefit from this development.","Additionally, in this business, we have received word that we'll be expanding our position to become the primary supplier to the leading gourmet coffee retailers. So all-in-all, the food service business continues to be an exciting place and important part of our Consumer Packaging franchise.","Moving on to Printed Papers. We had good quarter-over-quarter improvement, as we saw a seasonal uptick in volume in Brazil and Europe, and operations were very favorable in North America. We have a weakening price here throughout the quarter, but that's -- I wanted to just comment, that's largely driven by softness in the export market and a little bit of pricing that we saw in Europe. Additionally, in this business, we experienced lighter maintenance outages and a non-repeat of the bad debt issue that we saw in the second quarter.","Input costs were higher in the form of wood, as I mentioned, and this was a big impact in our paper business. And we did see a negative impact from FX in Brazil and Europe. And finally, as you're probably aware, we did announce in the quarter a $60 per ton increase for offset and cut size paper that we expect to begin to implement in the fourth quarter.","So moving to the next slide. I wanted to take a minute and give you an update on our plans for the Courtland mill wind down and the repositioning of our North American Papers business.","As we announced and discussed in September, we made a difficult decision to permanently close the Courtland mill. And as I said, this was a very tough decision for IP and, really, for our very dedicated employees, but clearly the right decision for the business. So relative to the shutdown plan, we intend to permanently shut the first 2 machines by mid-November. This will result in our exit from the Coated Papers business and the elimination of capacity for exports and selected marginally profitable domestic business.","The last 2 machines are scheduled to be shut down by mid-Q1 2014, and that will result in the elimination of the balance of the capacity at Courtland. Right now, we're in the process of running qualification trials at the 4 remaining mills, and we'll be transferring our most attractive business to these commodity and specialty mills to enable our best business to run at the lowest possible cost.","We have more business than we have capacity. Therefore, it will be necessary to exit the least profitable grades. While the end state that we'll reach later next year will be favorable, we are going to be in a transition mode for the next couple of quarters. So in the fourth quarter this year, we expect cost and really, inefficiencies of running the mill in a half -- with 2 machines, that does create inefficiencies. And that impact of that transition through the operating earnings line could be as much as $40 million.","In the end, we will be better positioned for long-term success in our North American business. We're going to have 2 excellent world-class, low-cost commodity mills; 2 very highly capable, well-equipped specialty mills to serve our most attractive segments and customers.","Moving on to distribution. Xpedx delivered a solid quarter, as we expected, driven by revenue improvement. And this was despite one less shipping day. And also, importantly, continued improvements in our operational cost. We continue to work very diligently on the spin-off opportunity with Unisource. And I'd say we're making progress on reaching a mutually acceptable transaction.","Turning to Ilim. We've talked about Ilim a little bit, and we did see significant progress on the ramp-up of the major capital projects at Koryazhma and Bratsk, along with some appreciation and move up in pulp prices. And this did result in an improvement in the operational EBITDA of $37 million over the second quarter.","Additionally, the ruble strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which did result in a net favorable noncash FX gain on the JV's $1.4 billion of U.S.-denominated debt.","Moving to the next slide. I wanted to update you where we are with the project ramp-up. As I mentioned, and as we said we would, we saw significant progress in the third quarter, as the project benefits are beginning to show up and the startup and ramp-up costs are continuing to come down. Ilim expects to make another big step forward in the fourth quarter, as operational efficiencies and equipment reliability continue to improve. Additionally, the team is working very hard on product qualification efforts as we speak. And as those products get qualified, we'll begin to sell those, and that will show up in the improved margins.","So while Ilim expects to see further improvement in results in the fourth quarter, some of this improvement will be offset by increased cost that are just associated with the season -- wood cost issues that hit us this time of year and other seasonal costs. But the way that we would -- the way we see Ilim, and we're very excited about it, is we've done the hard work, we're not done, but making great progress, and 2014 looks to be a great opportunity as well as beyond.","So turning to free cash flow and uses of cash. A lot happened during the quarter, all good. As you recall, we closed on the sale of the Temple-Inland Building Products business early in the quarter. Received $710 million in cash proceeds in July. On September 10, we announced a 17% increase in our regular dividend to $1.40 per share, payable in December of this year. Additionally, we announced an authorization to buy back up to $1.5 billion in shares. We've been active with this program since receiving that authorization. And up-to-date, and I guess through yesterday, we've repurchased more than 2.6 million shares at an average price of $45 per share for about $120 million.","Additionally, we continued to pay down debt, and that reduced our debt balance by $457 million year-to-date, and we expect to pay down roughly $600 million for the full year. As you can see from the chart, and John mentioned this, we continued to track well on our path towards our stated goal of $2.2 billion in free cash flow. And if you take the last quarter, the last 2 quarters, we are at a run rate of $1.8 billion. We feel good about our ability to continue to grow the free cash flow as we move into '14, and we feel very good about our capital allocation plan.","So moving to the fourth quarter outlook, before I turn it back to John. We see a relatively flat quarter-over-quarter change on volume. Seasonal increases in Brazil and European package are offset by the decline in North American papers due to the restructuring, and there are 2 less shipping days in North American packaging. Prices will continue to improve in North American Packaging, as discussed earlier, and we'll begin to see implementation of the announced price increases in North American Paper. And we should also see pricing improvement in our European and our Brazilian Packaging business.","On operations, the largest impact item will be associated with the Courtland transition and the wind down as previously discussed. We do expect some mild but continued impact from higher wood costs that we saw in Q3. Net-net, on mill outages, they'll be $10 million higher for the fourth quarter. And we expect taxes and interest to return to normal levels after the benefits we saw in Q3.","And while we expect additional improvement at the Ilim JV, seasonal costs and increasing wood supply issues will offset a good portion of these gains. And we're assuming no change in FX for the quarter, so no repeat of the gain in Q4.","So with that, John, let me turn it back over to you for the wrap up.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Carol. First of all, I'd like to emphasize that while this was a record operating earnings and EBITDA quarter, we've still got additional upsides from here. We continue to build momentum and generating free cash flow in our EBITDA results, and have line of sight to the $5 billion plus EBITDA goal we talked to investors about 1.5 years ago.","In the fourth quarter, as Carol said, we expect to realize the full benefits of the OCC's price increases announced in April and further price increases in North American Coated Paperboard, North American Papers, and Europe and Brazil Box businesses. We're also going to see some volume improvement in Brazil and some improvement in both our European and Brazilian Packaging businesses.","Carol talked about the Courtland headwinds, about $40 million. But we like how this business is going to look in 2014 with the 4 mill system. Boxes -- Box volume will be lighter in North America because they've got 2 less shipping days. And wood costs are going to continue to be a headwind, but I'd say the Southeast is finally drying out and inventories are getting rebuilt. And we have slightly higher maintenance outages in the fourth quarter and expect tax rate to return to normal level.","So what makes International Paper different and attractive? This last slide here, I'm on Slide 23, we have strong leading positions in our primary North American markets and the best margins, with further upside potential. We've got a global footprint in our key businesses with attractive growth potential, and we have the talent to lead the business and execute against our plans.","We've transformed the company and strengthened our position in our core platform businesses. We continue to manage the portfolio aggressively and have more upside through optimization, repositioning of our North American Papers business and strategic investments like Ilim that are ramping up with a lot of upside. We've improved our free cash flow generation and have plans to grow and sustain it, which leaves us in a good cash position and able to return better-than-cost of capital returns. At the same time, through a balanced use of cash, we returned some of that cash to our share owners, as evidenced by last month's actions to both increase our dividend and authorize a share buyback program.","So with that, I'll stop right there and open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess my first question is on -- if you could provide any outlook on early fourth quarter trends within Industrial Packaging? And John and Carol, I noticed on the slide in the appendix that you did see a little bit of a market-related downtime in industrial, if I saw that correctly. Could you comment at all where perhaps some softness arose in the quarter that you might not have anticipated? And I've got a couple of follow-ons.","John V. Faraci","You want to take that?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Sure, I will. The kind of the outlook, as we enter into the fourth quarter, in October, box demand is about where we thought it would be, still tracking kind of like the market tracks, just slightly positive. And for us, we were behind the industry numbers 300, 400 basis points early in the year. We've narrowed that to less than 100. In September, we were much less than 100 basis points behind. And that's what we're seeing going in the fourth quarter. So I think we don't anticipate any major changes in demand. On the other 2 channels to market for our Containerboard, the open market, domestic, of course, that reflects the U.S. Box business, and so that will track about the same. And the export market, we expect a normal fourth quarter seasonal demand pattern. With respect to your comment on the lack of order downtime, it was 70,000 tons. As you know, a very large system. And as we look at how the quarter unfolded in the third quarter, and we realized what orders we had and what basis weight and whether it's recycled and virgin, we made the paper we needed for the customer demand we had, as well as trying to position our inventories to the best way possible as we prepare for the beginning of next year and the maintenance outages we have. So with all those considerations, we come up with 70,000 tons of capacity we didn't need to employ.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Fair enough. And that's also a silver lining in terms of producing to market demand. I guess one other question I had, can you remind us what effect you think some of the increase in Asian Boxboard capacity might have on your business, if at all? And then the last question, I'll turn it over. Ultimately, how much market share do you think -- maybe it's a question for Tom Kadien, do you think you can get off the coffee cup market and paperboard?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Tom Kadien here. On the Asia Boxboard, we really haven't seen a lot of impact here in North America. Where we see the impact is in the global export markets, where pricing has come down. We are largely out of most of those difficult market segments, and it really hasn't had a big impact on us in North America at all. On the move from foam to paper, we're the largest cups stock producer in North America, out of 2 of our Bleached Board mills. And we've got push in about a 50% market share there. So if we've got our normal share, that would be 50%. We expect we'll do better than that. And we're also the largest supplier of paper cups and lids to the quick service restaurant and coffee segment. And we think we'll do better than our share there as well, as we have been over the last couple of years.","John V. Faraci","George, the only thing I'd add about Coated Board is we don't see -- we produce Coated Board in Poland and in Russia, and we don't see the Asian impact -- impacting those core markets for us. Most of it is staying somewhere in Asia. And if you just look at -- on our table, our Coated Board volume is up 48% year-over-year. Unfortunately, so are bunch of others. And that's -- that excess capacity situation has got to work through.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple of questions on Industrial Packaging, following up a bit more. Typically, would you expect that the fourth quarter seasonally to have a little bit more, a little bit less demand than you'd see in the third quarter? And can one extrapolate from that on what expectations one might have for market downtime in that business? And then second, I think Carol had mentioned that you were -- you've exited the quarter in the high 40s in terms of the box pricing. And then I think she said, you expected to get another $5 as 4Q progresses. So is it fair to assume about a $10 per ton price improvement, 4Q v 3Q in box prices? And then, lastly, is kind of a flat demand outlook for next year at this juncture in corrugated the most realistic, or are there reasons why it might be better or worse than that? And if you can help spell that out, that will be great.","John V. Faraci","Mark, before I let Mark set and answer all those questions, we're not going to forecast market downtime. We don't do that.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Right. Thank you, John. Question #1. Yes, Q4 typically, I think, would be seasonally a little lighter in demand. And that's a general statement about the market, but in particular, about International Paper's segment mix. And as Carol mentioned, there's a couple less shipping days, which is not really a seasonality issue, but just a reality. We're going to make the board we need to make for the business we have in all 3 channels: the box business, the open-market here in the U.S., and the open-market globally. The price question around exiting in the high 40s, we will recover, as John said, more than the $50 increase, which is compensating for some of the waste you have in the convergent operations. And so as we sit here today, we're up $101 from last third quarter. And I think your $10 quarter-over-quarter is probably not a bad number.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then lastly, as we think about...","Mark Stephan Sutton","I Oh, I'm sorry, your third question. Growth for next year. I was writing them down, and I didn't write that one down. Growth for next year, flat. I think when you look at the people who are developing forecast for box and looking at the macro indicators, there's a lot of energy around a slightly positive demand environment next year, maybe in 1.5%. And I think it's really going to be dependent on the U.S. economy. Box demand is going to track, nondurable is going to be a bit behind GDP. So as the consumer comes back in the market, we'll see good box demand. And hopefully, it's better than flat.","John V. Faraci","Mark, when you look at box demand for the industry, relative to where we were prior to recession, we're still 5% or 6% below the 390 billion square feet that were shipped in 2007. Box demand is growing at GDP less a point, and that's where we kind of think it is. If we get 3% GDP growth, which we should get at some point in time. And we're going to get positive box demand, which is going to be a big tailwind.","Carol L. Roberts","And one more part to add to that is, we did care about global demand for boxes. So with global demand up 3% to 4%, we all know there's a part of that segment, global segment, that we get to participate in. Specifically for International Paper, exports are very strategic. For the industry, they're strategic. So if you think about that, that could add another 0.5 point to 7\/10 of a point of growth in North America.","John V. Faraci","And I'd say, just to that point, if you looked at the page that shows our shipments year-to-date by volume, even though box market is up 0.5% in the U.S. our shipments outside the us or outside shipments in U.S. and exports are up 5% in the first 9 months of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Sticking on Containerboard. can you kind of give us a sense how you're thinking about inventory at this point? And do you draw down any more inventory in Q4?","Mark Stephan Sutton","I think we like where our inventories are right now, from the standpoint of operating our large system at the lowest possible cost. We had to prepare for some of the outages we have coming up, maintenance outages at the beginning of next year. And I think inventories are in good shape from the quality of inventory and returns. And we will operate our system, really, to the demand for our business, and not anticipate the need to build any inventory.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then in your slide deck, you guys kind of highlighted how there's some untapped low-cost capacity for containerboard. Could that represent an offering for you guys to take out some high-cost capacity down the road?","Mark Stephan Sutton","I think all that depends on the demand profile. But I think the point in all of that is we have opportunities for very low cost to make more containerboard if we have the demand for it. And as we prepare in the future for how we view our current offtake agreements with the mills we had to divest. So all of that will play into a decision we make on capacity. It's out there if we need it and it's low cost.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. And just one last question for Carol. Glad to see you guys buy back some stock, current quarter and year-to-date. Could there be an opportunity for you guys to take a more aggressive stance this year? Or is that more of an opportunity going into '14?","Carol L. Roberts","Well, as we said, we've got authorized $1.5 billion share buyback that we said was a 2- to 3-year program. And so we'll continue to monitor our options, but we'll probably stick to that path of that $1.5billion, 2 to 3 years. So you kind of do the math on that.","John V. Faraci","Lot of flexibility, though, in terms of how we go ahead and complete that share buyback.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Gresh of JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. First one, again, on Industrial Packaging. If we think about the downtime that you took in the quarter. Coming into the quarter, you're talking about building some inventories. So is it fair to kind of assume that the downtime was maybe weighted towards the end of the quarter, when we saw a little bit of the softer demand?","Mark Stephan Sutton","I wouldn't -- Phil, this is Mark. I would say, it really evolves through the quarter as we look at the actual demand from all 3 channels that we send Containerboard through and the inventory that we need. And inventory is not inventory. There's recycle, there's virgin, there's heavyweight, lightweight. And knowing what our seasonal demand is going to be for the upcoming few months, all weighs into it to -- the science behind it is balancing that system and making the board at the lowest possible marginal cost. So it's not a wait and see what happens and slam it in at the end. It's an organized process to really make our product at the lowest marginal cost.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Fair enough. Okay. Second question is just on Courtland. Appreciate the color around the $40 million incremental in the quarter. As we think about how that progresses through 1Q and into 2014, Carol or John, any color as to whether that would step up against, sequentially, in 1Q? Or it's kind of -- do we kind of level off here? And then, at what point do we step back down, do you think?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Phil, it's Tim Nichols. We're going to update that as we go. I think the important point to make here is the process is well underway. We're trying to do it at the lowest possible cost. We'll have 2 machines down in the middle of November. When we announced, we said the other 2 would come down by the end of the first quarter. We now had moved that up to mid-quarter, and the goal is to keep pulling that forward as rapidly as we can. Part of what we're doing is we're working through qualifications in other facilities for various products and customers. So you can think of the first 2 machines, that capacity coming out fairly quickly. You can think about the machine time used on the other 2 machines as being to do 2 things. One, cover for those qualifications. And number two, to help us build some inventory around unique products, like our colors, uncoated free sheet, where we need to build a little bit of inventory to manage the transition. So those machines are not fully available for current customer demand.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then last question for Carol, just on the free cash, or with respect to working capital, et cetera. You talked about kind of the past 2 quarters, your run rate that you're talking, kind of $1.8 billion in free cash. The other first quarter was a little lower than that. I assume the fourth quarter can be higher as you draw some of the working capital down for this. Is that $1.8 billion number kind of a fair number to think about this year? And kind of assuming that you do you still have some kind of working capital headwinds this year that maybe you don't have next year, how should we think about that?","Carol L. Roberts","Well, Phil, you make a great point. I think $1.8 billion is a good number. And if the working capital headwinds, because we're raising prices and expanding margins, I think we'll take those headwinds all day long. So it's hard to speculate on what next year might bring. And yes, this year, the headwind, the sales are up and -- because pricing is up. So that has been be a headwind that will level out. But I think $1.8 billion is kind of a good normalized level for where we're operating today, and we think it should go up from there.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And do you have a status of specifically what working capital headwind you might end up with this year, in that $1.8 billion number?","Carol L. Roberts","No, I wouldn't speculate on where the working capital will go in the fourth quarter. There's so many moving parts to that. And there's also a piece of working capital that's at corporate, that -- accruals and other things that aren't directly tied to ops. So I think we'll see where the fourth quarter comes out, but it should be helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman of UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Not to belabor the point of Industrial Packaging. But industry inventories rose fairly sharply in June through August. And I'm just wondering, do you have any sense if that was intentional, or did you see the market get more competitive at all? Or anything that changes your view on the market. And also, maybe if you could address some of the capacities expansion news that's come out over the last month or so?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Okay, Gail, and this is Mark. On inventory, and I can only speak for International Paper on the inventory front. And for us, it was just running our business for, as I said, balancing the near-term needs and making sure we have the lowest possible supply chain cost as we go into what we know is going to be a maintenance outage season. And quite honestly, we weren't as prepared in this past first quarter and second quarter as we would have liked to have been, and we spent some money. We don't want to do that again. So for us, it was about really having our system be the most efficient, from a service platform and the cost standpoint. From the rest of the industry, I think every company, obviously, has its own issues with how they view inventory. On capacity, we are seeing, as everyone has recognized, some new capacity coming in the market. We haven't seen any, I would say, direct impact. But I think the -- the thing that will unfold over time is some of this product will probably find a home in certain segments, and then the secondary impact would be that we may see some additional suppliers showing up in some of the export markets. But so far, I think the new capacity coming on, it's not all the same type of product, and it's not all completely applicable to every segment we compete in. So we're monitoring that like we would in any other business issue.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And at Pulp and Paper Week over the weekend, reduced the premium on West Coast median. Do you see that as anything significant, as a distributable to maybe some of the excess supply in the East? Is there any comment you can make there?","Mark Stephan Sutton","No comment on that right now.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. You talked about, Tom, I guess, the U.S. Coated Board market and how there's not been an impact on Asia. I guess, last quarter you talked about China, maybe, bottoming out. Is that still your view, or is it still getting incrementally worse?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","I would say, it's kind of moving along on the bottom. It hasn't gotten materially worse. Pricing is about where it was. We're starting to see some of the high-cost capacity come out and be shut down, at least temporarily. So I would say that's offering a bit of an offset to some of the new capacity that's come online. But I would call it kind of bouncing along the bottom. And demand is actually getting a little bit better over there in Asia right now. So we're seeing that, as well as we're seeing some mixed improvement for ourselves.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. One last question. I guess there was a reference on the slide in terms of pension, about $1.5 billion on 100 basis points. Is that meant to just be a sense of what the sensitivity is? And if so, could you just give a sense of, based on what you're seeing today, what your pension deficit would look like entering 2014?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, Gail, that's illustrated. So 100 basis points equates to about that. And interest rates over the last few days have come down a little bit, so going the other direction. And if you look at that total accounting, funding, we do that at the end of the year, and it's a combination of how did our assets performed versus what's the liability math tell us. But directionally, it should be moving in the right direction for us. So it should be better at the end of this year than it was at the end of last year, unless something changes dramatically between now and year end.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But you can't put a number to that?","Carol L. Roberts","No, I couldn't. Because I'd have to be trying to predict what asset is going to do between now and the end of the year, and where are interest rates between now and the end of the year. And that would be -- if I could do that, I'd probably be doing something else.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","If you could just talk a little bit about the Brazilian Containerboard and India operations. I noticed -- I guess, India had a little bit of a step-back from the second quarter in terms of its performance. And then also, the Brazil -- the Brazilian acquisition, I know it's early days, but that really hasn't contributed either. So sort of what kind of ramp do you think we could expect for those as we go into '14? And do you expect each of them -- certainly, Brazil should be profitable, but do you think India will also turn the corner?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes, it's Tim Nicholls. I'll talk about Brazil, and then turn it over to Tom for India. In Brazil, we've been squeezed this year. OCC has gone up dramatically, not precedent setting because we've seen this kind of cycles before. But we step into the operation right as OCC was taking off, and we saw our margin squeeze. So we've seen the worst of it. I expect margins to improve quite dramatically as we go into the fourth quarter. And I think the business has done a nice good job recovering price to cover the OCC increase. So we're still going to like the business a lot. We have no change in view on what we think the margin potential is. We -- even in a slower economic year, we still feel good about the growth this year going into next year. So it's unfortunate that we have margin compression, but I think we're on the road to recovery.","John V. Faraci","Chip, regarding India. The quarter that you see on, what is it, Page 33, that's all about an annual outage at Rajahmundry. We would have to get into the recovery boiler and do a lot of work. We were down for almost 25 days in the quarter. And we had a -- frankly, we had a pretty good September. 20,000 of the 40,000 tons that we sold in the quarter were sold in September. And we're set up for a good fourth quarter. The issue that we have been fighting, and the industry has been fighting over there, wood cost had run up as some competitors have added a pulping capacity. So pricing has been chasing wood cost increases for the better part of the year. And we're finally, at this point, I would say, catching up. So we had a pretty good September, and we expect a much better fourth quarter.","Jay Royalty","Tom, you might talk about the optimization of pulp [indiscernible] as well.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Yes. We're running at about 500 tons a day in the Rajahmundry pulp mill. We have capacity to do more than that. And we're, frankly, waiting on consents from the government to allow us to do that. So we've got some upside on cost, as well as productivity that we're just waiting on. We hope that to come through by the end of the year.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And then...","Thomas Gustave Kadien","[That's all we can make. So we're going to like it as we figure out how to make more.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And then one last quick one for Carol. Just as a follow-up on the pension issue. If we -- let's just say, who knows what happens between now and year end. But let's say that interest rates were 100 basis points higher, it was the corporate rate. I'm just trying to read this correctly, and the stock market stays up for the year. I don't think we would be remised to first of all, expect that shortfall to fall below $3 billion. I can't imagine that wouldn't happen. And then if that did happen, and I know it's different from accounting versus what the government requires. But if we did see, at least from an accounting standpoint, that net number come down, could we see your plan contribution number that you've been talking about for the next few years maybe come down as we look at 2015 or '16?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, Chip. Those are good questions. You're right. The math on your first part is if the 100 basis points stays in the market, it stays around where it is, there's going to be a significant reduction in the unfunded liability. And what you said is very accurate. So you're right also, relative to accounting versus funding. There are 2 different completely different sets of math. And from the funding, the 2014 funding and the '15, because there's a smoothing element to that, those are pretty well, I would say, locked in. The thing that could change that would be policy in D.C.. Law changes could change that, and that happened a couple of years ago. It could happen again, but not saying that or speculating. But the first 2 years, '14, '15 are locked in. Where a higher interest rate would help us, is -- you're also correct that it would start to feather in to what we would have to put into plan in the '16 to '17 timeframe. And it would reduce any money that we might have to put in there. So net-net, higher interest rates would be great. It would help us on the accounting and ultimately, it would support us on the funding as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Start off on the Courtland side. I wondered, either Tim Nicholls or Carol, can you give us some sense of just the EBITDA impact of that closure as we look forward, what's the hit look like from just not running that tonnage?","Timothy S. Nicholls","It's Tim, Mark. The way I would say it is this. We operate a system, and we have a mix of customers that we use the system to support. We had grown exports, we had grown some marginally profitable tons to fill up machine time over the past couple of years. And as we looked at the system that we had, we said, we can run a smaller system and do it better. So we're not going to forecast what earnings are going to be, but you can be assured that we look at the economics of we were going to run a system, and we have, in the 4 mills, a low-cost commodity set of assets. And even with [indiscernible] and Georgetown for they products they produce. We have a very low-cost system for specialty and value-added. So it's a combination of getting the right amount of capacity for the business that we want for the long-term, and not -- and from a capital allocation standpoint, keep investing in a system that sized larger than we need.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just one other question on Courtland, Tim. This is the third mill you've taken out of the white paper business now, having shutdown and then restarted part of Franklin and having converted Pensacola. I just wonder whether all of this affects you're thinking about investing in a new paper, another new paper machine down in Brazil?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Well, it's a great question, Mark. And the way we think about these options is based on the dynamics of the business. We view the uncoated freesheet markets around the world as very much regional markets. They have regional supply demand dynamics and margin dynamics. And so part of the complication around -- and we see this in Brazil, as we've told everyone. We're trying to grow into the region as fast as possible. Supply chains are long, you tie up cash and inventory, you have FX exposures. And depending on where you're planning to supply, you have different environmental certifications and forestry certifications that are required. So it's very hard to supply from one region of the world to the other for the long term. So it will be made on a case-by-case basis, region-by-region.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then just a couple of Industrial Packaging questions. Mark Sutton, was there any impact in the third quarter from some of those West Coast contracts starting to roll off?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Mark, you're speaking of the offtake agreement?","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, exactly.","Mark Stephan Sutton","So just to remind you, the offtake agreement is going for 3 years and there's a decreasing step down. So it's going to, over time, have an effect, but we don't expect any sharp effect. We've got to manage that as part of our supply chain, and it's a -- in the first year, and even in the second year, it's a pretty big part of our supply chain. So I would say, it has a sort of effect to the plan. And we've organized that step-down so that it works for us and our customers and our supply chain.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then, another question I have was just, with some of these new capacity, the machine conversion, some of these, the discussion of new lightweight recycled mills, I just wonder whether there's anything you could do with that idled 400,000 ton machine at Valliant to look at making lightweight recycled on that machine? And what would it take for you to restart or retool that machine?","Mark Stephan Sutton","I think, we -- Carol mentioned it in her comments, that's one of the options we have for some very low-cost capacity that is available for us, if we need it. And we look at the whole system, Mark. And based on that and our demand of our customers, we'll decide what type of products we actually need to make. Because as you know, every Containerboard mill is not the same. And so we haven't -- we're not prepared to talk about an estimate or anything, what it would take, capital-wise, to change the great output of that machine. But rest assured, all of that is in our consideration. But the main thing is, we'll bring capacity on if need it for the demand of our customers and for improving and getting at this optimization that Carol talked about in this new Industrial Packaging system.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. Then the last one is just, in the Industrial Packaging down in Brazil, you did a 7% margin this quarter. I think Klabin is up in the kind of low- to mid-30s, but they own forests so that presumably helps them, I think, kind of mid-West A Coast businesses, kind of somewhere between. What is a reasonable target, do you think, for kind of an EBITDA margin at Orsa?","Timothy S. Nicholls","So it's like what we said when we acquired the business. We think it could be solidly the mid-20s. So our view on margin opportunity has not changed, Mark.","John V. Faraci","Mark, I'd add just a comment out of capacity. I mean, our objective in all our businesses is to make what our customers require with a minimum amount of assets. So the fewer machines, fewer facilities, and so, we'll run our system as hard as we can. We're going to make the right products and only start up more capacity if we absolutely need it.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on Industrial Packaging. Carol outlined the $200 million optimization opportunity. And I was wondering if there was any sense of the timing to realize that opportunity, or if you're counting on any real improvement in the Containerboard markets over the last couple of years to realize that? And then switching to EMEA. You referenced the margin squeeze with box prices lagging Containerboard increases. Is this a sort of a normal lag, or are you seeing increased competitive pressure in boxes? Or how should we think about that going into 4Q?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Anthony, this is Mark. On the optimization, I think the optimization that we're talking about, that $200 million, really isn't about the market dynamic. It was about internal initiatives. Our mill system, optimizing the 16 mills and getting a lower average cost across those mills and including, in the supply chain. And the other part was on the commercial side and really just looking at the new box system and making sure we're making the right products in the right box plants and that we upgrade the segments and the customers within those segments. And that's -- we're already underway on some of that, and that's an ongoing process that I think we'll take. I think we originally said, post synergy period of the 24 months, we're not waiting to get started on that. But I would say, that's over the next couple of years. And if you could repeat the second question?","Carol L. Roberts","It was the EMEA box margin...","John V. Faraci","I can talk to that, Mark. What's happening is, you've got to remember, Europe is just coming out of a huge recession, so there's a lot of pressure on market demand. So it's more difficult with demand being negative year-over-year, certainly, in the Industrial segments, to get box prices up, as board prices are coming up. I think absent that, if we had a more normal economic environment, you'd see a quicker flow through.","Carol L. Roberts","What those -- to add also to that, John is exactly right. It does ebb and flow there. So if you look at the margins as an independent converter in Europe, there's -- kind of go up and down a little bit. But we feel pretty confident that as board goes up, ultimately, box prices will go up as well. And we're just in the trough part of that. We hit the trough part of that in the third quarter.","John V. Faraci","So let me wrap up and say, it was a very good quarter for International Paper. We performed to record levels. We've got more to come in 2014. We're going to generate a lot of cash. We're going to use it in a balanced way that creates value for our shareholders. That's the story, and we'll be talking more about it as we revisit with you in -- for the fourth quarter in January. Thanks.","Jay Royalty","Thanks, John, and thanks, all of you for taking the time to join us this morning, as always. Michele and I will be available after the call. We look forward to speaking with you, and our phone numbers are on Page 24 of the appendix. So have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will open the call for your questions.","It is now my pleasure to handover program over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.","Thank you, Kristen. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter 2017 earnings press release and today's presentation slides.","Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Guillermo, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. I'm going to begin today's presentation on slide 5. International Paper delivered strong results in the third quarter, with earnings growth across all of our business segments. These results were driven by continued solid business fundamentals and price realization, particularly within our North American Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers businesses.","Our Global Cellulose Fibers business also generated $52 million in synergies, which contributed to solid margins for the business in the quarter. Our Papers business delivered solid results as well, underscoring the resiliency of our overall portfolio. Unfortunately, our operations were impacted by two hurricanes during the quarter. And even as our teams managed the recovery extremely well and safely, often through very challenging personal circumstances, it was nevertheless a significant headwind in the quarter.","We also faced record high OCC prices in the third quarter, with average prices $14 per ton higher than in the second quarter. Our Ilim JV delivered solid operational results, driven by strong underlying demand and price realization.","And yesterday, we announced a strategic decision to transfer our North American Consumer Packaging business to Graphic Packaging. I'd like to take a few minutes to share some thoughts regarding this announcement.","So turning to slide 6, I'd like just to start by revisiting how we think about strategy and value creation and how that framework shaped our decision to transfer our business, our North American Consumer Packaging business and to essentially invest in a stronger Graphic Packaging.","Quite simply, our strategy is to create value in fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper by establishing what we call advantaged positions and serving attractive markets. What this means is that, when we choose the right products and the right markets and the right customers in those markets and importantly when we execute successfully, we create the most value for our shareholders.","So turning to slide 7, when you look at our North America Consumer Packaging business, we have a talented team of people, very good assets and really great customers. However, we also realized that our business does lack the overall scale and broad portfolio offerings and the integration levels between board and converting required to grow value in this segment today. At the same time, we recognize the strong potential of the consumer packaging space overall, and wanted to find the best way to participate and create the most value for our shareholders.","And so after evaluating a range of strategic options, we concluded that putting the business together with Graphic Packaging could unlock the full potential of our business today. And at a high-level, we're transferring the business and establishing an ownership interest in Graphic Packaging through a very tax-efficient structure that captures the greatest value for our shareholders.","IP is investing in a strong consumer packaging platform, that is well-positioned for long-term value creation. We are creating option value in the consumer packaging space, while we remain focused on growing and improving our core businesses.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Glenn, who will walk you through the details of the transaction and the rest of our third quarter performance discussion. So, Glenn?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm speaking now to slide 8 in the presentation, which outlines the key points of this transaction that combines our North American Consumer Packaging business with Graphic Packaging. First and foremost, we consider the $1.8 billion consideration for our existing Consumer Packaging business to be an excellent value for International Paper shareholders, given the implied multiple of 8.6 times our adjusted 2017 estimated EBITDA for the business.","We believe strongly the transaction captures the underlying value of North America Consumer Packaging, our business today while also allowing International Paper to participate in the value-creating potential of the combined entity going forward.","Regarding the specifics, IP is contributing our North American Consumer Packaging business into a subsidiary of Graphic Packaging that will hold the assets of the combined businesses for $1.8 billion. In the form of an ownership position in new entity of 20.5%, which was valued at approximately $1.14 billion at the time of the agreement and has appreciated by approximately $70 million by the close of trading yesterday. We will also receive $660 million in cash proceeds from a new loan that will be assumed by Graphic Packaging.","The agreement incorporates a two-year lock-up whereby IP cannot sell its ownership interest in the partnership and a five-year standstill whereby IP cannot increase its ownership interests. From a financial pro forma standpoint, we expect this transaction to be earnings neutral to slightly accretive for IP in 2018 and it's also important to note that no current cash taxes are due at the time of the transaction given the efficient tax structure we've put together.","Further, we intend to use the $660 million cash proceeds to pay down existing debt, ultimately keeping the transaction leverage neutral. Going forward, we expect to receive dividends of approximately $25 million per year beginning in 2018 based on Graphic Packaging's current dividend policy.","So let me sum up this discussion by saying that we feel very good about this agreement, which should close in early 2018 pending customary regulatory approvals and conditions. And International Paper is investing in a new stronger and premier consumer packaging platform that's well positioned for shareholder value creation, while further enabling our company to be focused on growing meaningful value in our core businesses of Industrial Packaging and Cellulose Fibers.","So now back to the quarter. Turning to page 9 to review our third quarter financial results, the company delivered solid margin expansion and free cash flow during the quarter driven by healthy demand across our businesses, price realization and lower seasonal maintenance outages.","In terms of the quarter-over-quarter bridge depicted on slide 10, we saw a significant price lift in the quarter, mainly driven by our North American Industrial Packaging business as well as continued pricing momentum in Global Cellulose Fibers. Volume was down sequentially with one less shipping day in our North American box business and seasonally slower demand in Europe. Our North American mill operations were impacted by the two hurricanes, resulting in the $30 million higher costs in the quarter, which we do not expect any insurance recovery on.","Maintenance outage expenses were lower and input costs were sequentially higher, driven mostly by record high OCC prices, which peaked in the quarter. Corporate and interest expenses were also higher and the effective tax rate was more favorable, due \u2013 mainly due to investment tax credits on energy projects. And lastly, earnings from our Ilim JV were strong on improved pricing and favorable FX.","Now turning to the businesses, beginning on slide 11, earnings in Industrial Packaging improved sequentially on continued price realization and lower maintenance outages. Pricing in our North American box business flowed through as expected and the 2017 spring increase is effectively complete. We also continue to benefit from higher pricing and flow through in export containerboard markets. Volume, again, was lower given one less shipping day in North America Packaging versus the second quarter as well as seasonally softer volume conditions in our EMEA Packaging business.","As we said, our operations were impacted by two hurricanes with a net impact just to Industrial Packaging of $20 million during the quarter. Beyond the hurricanes, our mills were also affected by certain isolated reliability issues, which combined, put additional cost pressure on a system which continues to run full to meet our strong demand. Input costs in the third quarter were also higher driven by record high OCC prices and marginally higher wood, chemical and distribution costs associated with the impact of the hurricanes. And lastly, the business received $5 million in insurance proceeds related to Pensacola during the third quarter.","On slide 12, we've outlined some of the details of our recent announcement to convert our number 15 paper machine at the Riverdale Mill from uncoated freesheet to high quality virgin whitetop containerboard. This again is an excellent example of our strategy that Mark outlined: to establish and leverage advantaged positions in attractive markets and to grow value by investing in high-return projects that support growth in our strategic segments.","Further given our refocusing of resources to our core businesses, this project will be funded within our existing annual capital investment allocation run rate. We are aiming for a mid 2019 startup, which is timed well given our outlook on incremental demand.","Now on slide 13, our Global Cellulose Fibers business delivered very solid results as well in the third quarter. Earnings improved $45 million, driven by better pricing, lower maintenance outage spending and strong synergy realization, despite having overcome a $5 million headwind from Hurricane Irma. All-in, we're very pleased with the progress in Global Cellulose Fibers, which improved to a 19% average EBITDA margin in the quarter, again exemplifying our commitment to allocate our resources to growing profitable businesses. Project to date, Global Cellulose Fibers is performing well ahead of our initial acquisition financial model expectations.","Turning to slide 14, as you can see, our Global Cellulose Fibers business delivered very strong synergy realization performance in the third quarter, capturing $52 million across the enterprise, including approximately $17 million of one-time benefits for tax credits related to the energy projects I spoke of earlier.","All-in, we have high confidence in our ability to continue to deliver synergies at a faster rate than originally outlined. And we also want to take this opportunity to reaffirm our new synergy target of $200 million, which we view as an essential pillar to the sustained earnings potential of the business.","Moving to Printing Papers, results came in better than expected, driven by improved price and mix, particularly in our Brazil business, as well as continued price realization in European Papers. Maintenance outage expenses were significantly lower in the third quarter as expected, while input costs were impacted by higher fiber and energy.","On slide 16, as you can see, our Consumer Packaging business results improved sequentially across all components of the financial bridge. Commercially, pricing continued to improve on realization of the April 2017 price increase and planned mix upside was delivered. Lastly, maintenance outage expenses were significantly lower in the quarter again as expected.","Moving to Ilim, the JV again delivered solid results, driven by higher pricing, which was partially offset by lower volume related to the Bratsk maintenance outage. And equity earnings also benefited from a non-cash FX gain on the JV's U.S. denominated debt.","So, let me now turn to page 18. This is our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect to see flow through benefits from the spring 2017 North American containerboard and box price increase as well as further price realization in export markets, which in the fourth quarter alone should amount to an incremental $20 million.","In Global Cellulose Fibers, we anticipate additional price realization and mix benefits of $15 million on continued strong global demand, particularly in China. We also want to note that Brazil Papers \u2013 in Brazil Papers, we expect an additional $10 million in earnings on better seasonal mix.","On volume, our North American box business will be unfavorably impacted by one less shipping day, even as we expect demand to remain very strong. Across our other businesses, we anticipate stable volumes with some modest seasonal improvement as noted in the heat map for a total benefit of about $15 million.","In operations, our North America Industrial Packaging business will improve by $35 million as we put the hurricanes and other operational issues we discussed earlier behind us. Within our Global Cellulose Fibers business, operating costs will be modestly higher and planned maintenance outage expenses across the entire enterprise are expected to increase by $11 million in the fourth quarter.","Input costs, again, in North America Industrial Packaging, are expected to improve by $35 million quarter-over-quarter. This is driven by lower OCC costs, but partially offset by higher wood and chemical costs.","Across our other businesses, we anticipate $15 million in higher input costs, partly driven by the lingering effects of the hurricanes primarily in wood and chemicals.","Lastly, in the other items category, we included our refined outlook for corporate expenses, interest expenses, tax rates and equity earnings from our Ilim JV.","So to close, on page 19 for me and before I hand the call back over to Mark, we wanted to address our capital allocation priorities. While we speak often about our balanced use of cash approach, it all starts with strong cash from operations. And we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our cash generation.","With that said, in the near-term, we are clearly in a de-leveraging mode following our pulp acquisition last year as we aim to bring our leverage back to less than 3 times debt-to-EBITDA on a Moody's adjusted basis by the end of next year. And as noted earlier, the cash contribution of the Graphic Packaging transaction was structured to ensure we have no obstacles and a clear path toward meeting our balance sheet commitments.","At the same time, within the quarter, we also took material risk off the table with targeted moves inside our pension plan, including the recently announced annuity purchase that essentially transferred $1.3 billion in pension benefit obligations to a highly rated retirements benefits provider.","All this enabled us to continue to increase our dividend. Earlier this month, we announced our sixth consecutive annual dividend increase since restoring it to pre-recession levels in 2011, keeping with our commitment to a competitive and sustainable dividend as earnings and cash flow expand.","And lastly, we will continue to reinvest in value-creating projects, and with a healthy spread above the cost of capital, such as the Madrid and Riverdale conversions we have discussed in detail.","So in summary, the takeaway here is that we are confident in our cash generation and reinforce our commitment to a balanced use of cash as we enter 2018.","And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Glenn. International Paper is well-positioned for a strong fourth quarter, and with solid results across the board and solid cash generation. We continue to see healthy global demand across our key businesses. And we expect additional margin expansion from our first half pricing initiatives. On input costs, we expect some relief from record high OCC prices in the third quarter with some offsets on seasonally higher wood as well as higher chemicals and energy.","We also anticipate another quarter of strong synergy generation in our Global Cellulose Fibers business and a seasonally light maintenance schedule across our mill system. Net-net, we are optimistic for a solid performance in the fourth quarter with excellent cash generation and a very strong year for International Paper.","With that, let me open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for the details. And congratulations on the transaction announcement and the progress throughout the year. Just housekeeping, folks, I just want to double check. On the bridge sequentially that you provided, unless I'm double counting something, I kind of came up with something between $0.15 and $0.20 sequential pick up in earnings fourth quarter versus third quarter. Is that in the ballpark? Or did we miscalculate something?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","I think that's roughly in the ballpark, there is certainly a sequential uplift, George, quarter-over-quarter.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that, Glenn. Second question I had regarding Consumer. Obviously you're putting the North American Consumer business into the venture with Graphic Packaging. When we think about Kwidzyn, obviously that was part of Consumer, it produces a lot of different grades, but one of them was coated board. What's the role of Kwidzyn in the strategy for International Paper on a going-forward basis?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","George, it's a great question. We do have a board machine at Kwidzyn, and we also have one at our Svetogorsk mill in Russia. They serve targeted segments that are generally in the Consumer Packaging.","That's not part of this transfer into Graphic Packaging. And when we think about what we do in Europe, we have \u2013 we serve a number of markets, packaging, industrial and consumer, uncoated freesheet, we make boxes. We don't do any consumer packaging converting. And really when you look at mills in countries like Poland and Russia, you tend to have the model where you use the wood advantage and you make some of the products that the market needs locally in all kind of segments. So, that's still an important part of our EMEA Paper and Packaging portfolio.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Mark, thanks for that. My last two and I will turn it over. One of the things that we were picking up at recent industry conferences and we're seeing a little bit in your results here as well, some building impact from inflation throughout the supply chain, everything from input cost to labor. Can you comment on that and to the degree to which your customers are beginning ask you, maybe mostly in the box and containerboard business how you might be able to help them either with the systems or machinery approach or some other approach that help them take cost out of the supply chain, and how are you dealing with inflation as well on your business?","And then Riverdale, a little bit more costly conversion than what we've seen in the most recent round of conversion, I know whitetop's a consideration there. Is there anything else that we should consider in terms of the capital cost per ton on that conversion? Thank you.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Hey, George, it's Tim.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, Tim.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","On Riverdale, I'll start with that \u2013 hey. Start with Riverdale and then I'll go back to your previous question and Glenn may have something he wants to add. But on Riverdale, we know this internally, a machine is not a machine, a mill is not a mill, and so, it depends on what you're trying to do. This is going to be a two-ply sheet. It's a bit more of a sophisticated \u2013 I mean, we understand that we've done it before, but sophisticated investment. And when you look at it on an annual ton basis, we still think it's very attractive with very attractive return. So, we're going to be making a whitetop liner, not a brown product as the lead product on the machine. So, I think it's understandable on that basis.","Your inflation question, I mean just from a box standpoint and Industrial Packaging standpoint, we work with our customers all the time on trying to help them take cost out of their system. And we do it through a number of means. We have technical experts inside. We're either looking at case erecting equipment or we're looking at process flow. So it's pretty much ongoing.","And we don't often talk about it, but just in general inflation internally to the business, we have a significant lift every year that we have to try to cover and then have initiatives that create value on top of that. So I'm not familiar with the conference you're referencing or the comments, but that's just a little color on what we do.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim, the internal inflation, I'll let you go here, what is that roughly, can you remind us?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","It varies from year-to-year, but it's significant. I mean, it's over $100 million. So \u2013 and then in recent years, medical cost have jumped up a little bit, so it's not uncommon for us to have $120 million to $130 million of just general inflation built into the business that we have to cover.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, sir.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","George, this is Mark. Just a final comment on inflation. One of the things we target in our internal improvement, something we call non-price initiatives, so reliability improvements in our manufacturing operations and cost improvements in all our business processes, we target to overcome that internal inflation at a minimum and maybe in some cases do better than the internal inflation.","And then we work on input cost and all of that with our commercial terms. So it's part of our philosophy of how we need to operate every year.","One last comment on Riverdale, capital costs are also relative to what system you're investing it in. And the way we look at this is, this will be the 17th containerboard mill in our world class systems. So the investment in Riverdale also enables savings in other parts of the system that don't show up in just a capital cost per annual ton.","We are currently buying bleached fiber to make whitetop in a mill that was designed to make brown linerboard, that mill will now be free to make brown linerboard. So there's system effects, when you have a system our size, that the capital cost per ton can be a little deceiving.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Mark, thanks for that. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","First of all \u2013 good morning. I had a question on pulp actually. It looks like the pulp price realizations were up $33 a ton year-over-year, with presumably a richer mix, but list prices were up easily $100. So, evidently the discounts are growing. And I guess, question one is, is there a pent-up pricing that we're going to see in the future that we're going to start to catch up with realizations?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Hi, Steve. Jean-Michel speaking. Good morning. I think there is a couple of things to look at. First of all, there's a big mix effect, too, in the price of pulp because you get a price, which includes fluff, which includes softwood in general, so sometimes it doesn't appear really like it is, because if you just take fluff, our realization is more like $65. So, it's kind of high of what you have here. The other thing is, we have \u2013 when we take what happen usually in the market, but then what happened this year is after the contract negotiation in 2016 and that's a (24:48) question of rebate or whatever, in general, the prices went down in Q1. So, when we compare to last year, you have to be careful because you have the drop of $20 in Q1 that we have tendency to forget. So, if you take December to today or quarter-to-quarter, you have the increase was down, plus the drop, which will make up for. So, the actual price increase realization is more around $65.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","So, thanks, Jean-Michel. Does it make sense to reduce the discounts, so that the realizations are closer to what the lists are?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","So, to be honest with you, this is a \u2013 it's a complicated and complex question. Some customers wants to work with an index. And the reason is relatively logical, which is because we do multi-year contracts. And they feel that it's better with an index. But I'm not always sure that an index and a discount is the right way to make price. Even if when you look at the long-term, ultimately it comes to the same number. But we don't sell on the index. Let's not forget that we have a lot of customers, which are list price quarter-to-quarter or monthly price, so the mix of contracts, list price, is always another difficulty to do, but I understand your point. This being said, as of today, we haven't found a better way to look on very long-term contract pricing, that doesn't mean we're not trying to find one.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick one on the Graphic Packaging deal, so I guess we're going to create a second equity earnings line similar to Ilim and you'll get a $25 million annual dividend, is that the way to model it?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","There'll be an equity earnings line and we will also get, from a cash basis, a $25 million dividend.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Great. And if you were to monetize it and I \u2013 looks like a great investment, in the couple of years, would you get 64 million shares in GPK plus the 4% cash component?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","So, essentially it would be broken down, so 19% of that would be in shares and the remaining would be in cash.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Oh I was thinking it was 16% or 17% (27:14). Okay. Thanks, Glenn.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with The Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. One, obviously waste paper OCC's been very, very volatile, wanted to get your take as to what you're seeing currently and what would you expect to happen in the months ahead?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","I'm sorry, Mark, that was for OCC?","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Hey, Mark, Tim. I don't know that my crystal ball or our crystal ball is any better than anyone else's. I think that we believe that there may be some elements in the China market that are starting to buy again. I think there was a period of review given permit levels and making sure that no one exceeded a permit level in China for this year, caused a bit of review and maybe a cessation of some part of purchases. And now, it may be that some of that is starting to come back as we approach the end of the year. But I think the full effect of what's happened in China is still rippling through the North American market. So, in big picture terms, I think OCC goes higher, it's hard to put an exact time on it until we see exactly what China does around not only re-issuing permits, but at what levels.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And do you have any intelligence on where that dialog on contamination levels in particular might be? And if, in fact, that were to be at the 0.3%, what type of capability do you have in your system to, for instance, bring OCC to meet those levels? And how might the market play out if, in fact, these very aggressive limits on contamination levels were to be put in place?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","That's a great question. I think it's a bit of wait and see. I don't know that we would say we have any differential capability that anyone else does not have, it's a challenge, it's at very low level. I think it's going to impact some grades of waste fiber more than others obviously. But yeah, it's very low and I don't know how that ultimately gets worked out.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So Mark, let me add just a little bit. This will settle out given the importance of this input material for the Global Packaging business. So for example, if capital is needed to better screen OCC at different quality levels and the economics are there because by not doing it you've eliminated part of the supply, the capital will be spent. There are other ways to manage fiber quality, the fiber quality gradient by treatments on recycled paper machine. So my view is, this is a really important long-term input material for the Global Packaging business. And as the market grows, the fiber quality will be stretched. And over time, you will find capital solutions or other types of workarounds to manage a different quality of fiber, just like you manage in some cases different qualities of virgin wood fiber. And so, there is an engineering solution to most of this that the economics will drive.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Makes sense. And two real quick ones. Can you tell us where your box prices were exiting the quarter versus where they were on average versus the quarter? And then maybe just what current demand trends through the first two weeks of October in containerboard and corrugated were?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Demand has been good. We're having a very solid October so far. And you know it's a tough comp given what happened seasonally last year. Yeah, we exited the quarter higher on pricing. We were probably $8 to $10 above what the average there is in the appendix. And we think we're getting full realization on both of the \u2013 both the $40 from last fall and the $50 from the spring. If you recall, there's a little bit of \u2013 it's customer-by-customer, but some customers were not impacted by the published down early last year. And so, instead of getting a $40 or $50 they got, you know, $25 to $35 depending on the movement.","The other thing is, it did not apply to all tons. If you're looking at the number and thinking that it's below the $90, there's still a little bit more realization to go and some of the segments like agriculture, pricing was already set as price increase announcements came through and so that will catch up over time.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Last month, obviously, some of your competitors floated a price increase in containerboard. And I know you guys make your own determinations on price, obviously you chose not to participate in that, but just wondered, if you could comment on what the decision making process was like there? And your thoughts on the ability to pass through some of the inflation that you're seeing in some parts of the business now?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah, we don't talk about forecasting price going forward. I can share a little bit about the type of internal dynamics in general that we look at when we consider pricing. There's a number of macro factors that go into that consideration, but it's not just a numbers exercise. So we try to think both tactically and strategically about pricing and how we want to manage through cycles.","So we were looking at a number of factors, OCC cost being one of them, and trying to take into account \u2013 at the end of the day what we're trying to do is we're trying to grow margins sustainably. And so all of the decisions that we take, whether it's commercially or operationally is about creating value and doing it on a sustainable basis.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And a question on Riverdale, I was wondering if you could comment on what made that the right asset to convert? And once the conversion is done, where do you think that it'll \u2013 where you think its cost position will lie against your other containerboard assets and versus the North American industry in general?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. A good question. Well, we like Riverdale, it's a good mill, it's in a good fiber basket, and it's got good access to all the geographies that are important to us. So we like the mill a lot. It's got a great team there. And so we're excited to have those team members become a part of Industrial Packaging. What was the second part of your question? I'm sorry.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just a sense of where you think like maybe quartile wise...","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Oh yeah.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","...it will fit on the cost curve, yeah.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Well, yeah, comparing it to brown and white really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. From a white standpoint, we think it'll be first quartile. So we'll get a cost advantage. It's going to be a very high quality sheet. So just everything about it looked good, and as Mark said, it does free up other machines that were producing whitetop for us, they now produce brown, and so we get a benefit there as well.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. One last one. Any initial (35:32) thoughts on 2018 maintenance expense or capital \u2013 CapEx numbers?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yes. This is Glenn speaking. Again, we'll lay out the full view of 2018 either later in the quarter or after the end of the year. But as we look at our outage schedule into next year, we have a heavy outage schedule coming at us as we move, continually move forward into our 18-month outage program. So net-net, we can expect higher outages next year, but we did not quantify that for today.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Hi, good morning.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Morning, Gail.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","In terms of the Graphic Packaging deal, is there any significant kind of corporate over \u2013 like overhead that might kind of be stranded with the company? Like, would we expect a fairly higher corporate line next year just as you work through that?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah, I think you're right on target, Gail. Certainly there will be some stranded overhead that we're going to put our energy around mitigating to the largest extent. We will plan to keep that at the corporate line next year as we work it down. We haven't quantified that exactly yet, but that's an expectation that was factored into all the analysis.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. But you'll quantify it, I guess, as they start modeling next year. And just some of the outages and issues that you've had in containerboard between Pensacola and Orange this year. Tim, can you just give any sense of where you are with your inventories? And where you might think you'll be kind of as we enter next year?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. We've been tight all year, Gail. In fact it's starting with Hurricane Matthew last fall and working through that and then Pensacola as you managed, and now two hurricanes that impacted two different containerboard mills. So it's tight, we're managing it, we're getting better at how we manage it. I think we're on steady footing at the moment. And I expect us \u2013 when you run tight, you build capability. And so I think we've demonstrated to ourselves that we can run with lower levels than we've carried in the past.","One wrinkle in all of that is what's happening with the transportation markets, which have been somewhat disrupted due to the same influences but also a lot tighter, given what some of the rail lines are doing around business model, but also trucking. So when supply chain delivery times start stretching out, then we need to start working with more inventory to support our network.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. And maybe just one last one. I don't think you quantified but can you give any sense of what your box shipments have been doing year-on-year through what you've seen in October to date? And I appreciate it's a tough comp, but...","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Tough comp, but we are running on an absolute basis up about 4% so far through the month. So it feels very strong to us right now.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning, Mark and Glenn. First question has to do with the Riverdale conversion. If you could give us the timing of when that starts to switch over from white paper, is it going to be one \u2013 like three months or two-month period, where you're doing all the work? Or are you going to stage it like one of the other conversions we know about?","And then secondly, that's a lot of whitetop at once. Are you planning to tweak your system, where maybe you'll focus more on your whitetop production at Riverdale and de-emphasize it elsewhere? Or how should we think about that?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Hey Chip, it's Tim. Yeah. That's exactly the play, move it from where it's being produced today, get a better cost structure, get a very high quality sheet, and then free up those assets that are currently running it today to run other products. So that's exactly the play.","On the conversion, we said mid-2019, the long lead time on all of that is finishing the detailed engineering, getting the equipment on order, getting the equipment delivered, getting everything ready to go from a project standpoint, the actual conversion really doesn't take that long, 30 to 45 days and it can come off of uncoated freesheet and be back up on containerboard.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then, one other quick one. When you look at the pulp situation, I know there was a question earlier, but \u2013 and you mentioned the discount, I would imagine that varies when you re-strike contracts? And if you could just remind us, I understand that about maybe a third or so, maybe 40% are actually renewed or are subject to renewal each year and that's when that discount is addressed and I would imagine there are some movement there based on where the market is overall at that time. Is that a fair way to look at it?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Hi, Jean-Michel speaking again. Yes, you're correct, we are in the middle of \u2013 almost the end actually, the contract renegotiation. Some are more than one year, so every year roughly we do have 30% to 40% of our contracts, which are being renewed.","It's really customer per customer, because it will depend of the volume they want, the product they want, the mix, so it's difficult to give a trend. I will say so far our renewal, which is the most important, because it shows the confidence from our customers is going very well. So I think that's the first thing, that means the customers are satisfied with new GCF. And this is what we wanted to achieve first and foremost. And then customer per customer really it varies tremendously.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with Stephens.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Hi, Mark. Welcome back.","Operator","Mark, if your line is closed, can you please unmute it at this time?","Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Can you hear me?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","We can now.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","We can hear you now, Mark.","Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry about that. So in your white paper outlook, you call the outlook stable in most places, I'm curious what your expectation is for white paper imports. And I was also hoping you could give us a sense of what the demand looks like from the Brazilian white paper perspective.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Mark, I'm going to ask Mike Amick, who runs our \u2013 most of our Paper \u2013 white paper business globally to take a shot at that. Mike?","W. Michael Amick Jr. - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Mark. And hello, Mark, welcome back. Yeah, on demand from an import standpoint, as you know, North America has been down about roughly 20%. We saw that continue in the third quarter. And with respect to outlook, I don't know that it will change a whole lot. We also with respect to Brazilian demand, and in particular across Latin America, we posted two positive quarters in Brazil domestically, let's say it was (43:18) about a 0.5%. So it continues to be a little on the light side, and I wouldn't call it robust. We do \u2013 are moving into a seasonally stronger period, and we...","Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Right.","W. Michael Amick Jr. - International Paper Co.","...expect to see that pick up. And demand right now both across the Americas looks pretty good as we kind of closed out third week in October.","Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's super helpful. And just \u2013 I'm sorry to come back to Riverdale again, but as you move that whitetop to Riverdale and re-optimize at the other mills, is that going to actually free up productive capacity as well?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yes. So it's absolutely right, Mark. We currently produce whitetop at two other mills in our system, and we would move all of that to Riverdale, and then have the benefit of producing other products at those two mills.","Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","And as you produce those products, is that going to reduce your changeovers et cetera, and will that actually increase the capacity of those assets?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","It'll increase a little bit incrementally, it's just \u2013 they'll be producing products that are easier to produce, and so we should be able to squeeze a little bit more volume out of those two mills.","Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","That's super. Thank you very much.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Good morning, Chris.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions here. One, if I could come back to the cellulosic business, Jean-Michel or Mark which ever you want to take this, just so I make sure I understand this right. When we look on a year-over-year basis, there is somewhere between $130 per ton to $160 per ton higher for various grades, with SBSK fluff et cetera. And you guys produce about 4 million tons there just a tick under, when we think about \u2013 and appreciating that some of that maybe 20 (45:17) is already down or some movement in there, I mean there could be directionally $100 million of price lift year-over-year, that could be a $400 million swing. Help me understand how that might phase in or help us scale and size what the opportunity may be appreciating that maybe not everything happens in one year and you talked about indices and different components, but I mean it sounds like a pretty big swing, and help us understand how this phasing could occur?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Yeah. So, let me come back. We produced roughly 3.5 million metric tons, (45:55) most, we have on that about 65% fluff and specialty and 35% market pulp. So, they, as you know, move differently. The market pulp moves faster even if in the NBSK from Grande Prairie, we work a lot with contracts too because NBSK from Grande Prairie is very, very well appreciated.","When you look at the upbeat on (46:23) prices compared to when we started the year, it's big, it's already in our number now, but you can see it, it does create an amount, which is maybe not far from the number you mentioned. And it's in our number now. I don't think there's \u2013 maybe a little bit more if Q4 continue to be strong like that. So, yes, it is a strong dynamic. I mean, if you take a 3.5 million metric tons and you get just $20 increase, that's $70 million dollars, so any increase in pulp is very strong for us.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Are there not kind of contracts for example on the two-thirds that you make that's in the fluff side that those are generally locked for a year and then they get reset the following year or I guess for a bonus (47:15), I don't feel like that's all been realized when we look at spot versus contract in the numbers.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Yeah.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, is there another substantial step-up, perhaps, in 2018? That's what I'm really trying to get at.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","No, you won't have on 2018 from what we've announced in 2017. 2017, what we announced will be done by the end of the year. When we have a contract that moves, they \u2013 even if they are for one year, they are \u2013 most of them, most of them again is generality, a quarterly revision with index. So, the time you get it, it's sometimes six months that you get it. And so far, most of our increase have been on the first half of the year. So, we're getting it this quarter, and so we got another 15 and we're planning to get on average another 10 or something like that, all grade included for next quarter.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","But you have the average annual yield curve.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","The average annual curve will be there, yes, because we've been very strong on the second half, if you compare to first half.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I'll follow up a bit later. One other question, I kind of wanted to touch on was, when I look at your corrugated business, it looks like you were \u2013 perhaps, Tim, you can help me with this. You were down a couple points in the quarter. I think the market was up a couple points. Was there something in particular about your mix, in particular customer mix or would we kind of expect that to go back towards market levels as you work through the next couple quarters?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah we're actually \u2013 yeah. I mean, like any point in time in a business like converting, there's things moving in and things moving out. So, we had taken some decisions that hit us earlier. We also have some new business that's coming in, that hasn't been fully ramped up yet. So, I attribute it to just timing. And you'll see our growth numbers go up as we go through the next couple of quarters with those wins coming in.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Was there anything potentially hurricane-related, that you had a bigger footprint through a region or something of that nature but...","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","A little bit, but it was \u2013 it hit us for about 7,000 tons. So, big enough but not significant in a way.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Good luck, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks. Good morning, Glenn. Thanks, everyone. Mark or Jean-Michel, just a couple on pulp, if you don't mind. In terms of the Chinese mills using more pulp in lieu of OCC at the moment, how sustainable do you think that is? And why?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","That's a very good question because I think, it's sustainable in the condition of \u2013 because they don't have the choice right now. I'm sure if they had more OCC or recycling product they could use, they would probably mix it up. So it's more a question of, is the OCC or is the recycled products going to be more available in China than anything.","In terms of is it possible, it is. Actually, you see in China that all grade prices are going up, so it's not only pulp or OCC, it's all the grades because pulp and other raw materials are more expensive, it has gone through and prices are up. Is it sustainable? I can't tell you that, I don't know. Really no idea. I mean if we stay like we are today in terms of what's going on with the imports or what's going on with the government limiting the recycle, it could stay for some time.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. Related question Jean-Michel, I mean, some producers \u2013 pulp producers have talked about these global pulp market conditions being the best they've been in a decade, just given all the supply disruptions and the additional Chinese demand, because of the recycled fiber import restrictions. How sustainable do you consider these conditions just based on all these unusual supply disruptions, the China situation et cetera?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","So I'm going to separate if you allow me, market pulp and fluff pulp.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Because in fluff pulp, we don't see that impact. Fluff pulp is linked to the \u2013 and consumer consumption, and they use fluff, they cannot swing from something to another. So, the fluff pulp market worldwide continues to be very wealthy with a 4% to 5% growth. And we are growing about 4% to 5% as the market. So, I think this is one thing you have to separate from the market pulp.","The market pulp is today probably, I would say, more shake up than it should be, because there is a lot of things as you were mentioning both from the demand standpoint and from the supply standpoint, which are all going out in tightening it up. How long it's going to last? I don't have a crystal ball, I don't know, but I do think with time that pressure should not be as big as it is right now.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And one last question about fluff versus market a bit, over time fluff and softwood have moved roughly in tandem with each other. Do you have reason to think that will not continue to be the case and if so why?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","So, I think it is always a question of supply\/demand as you know. And they will lack (53:04) some trends, but fluff is always much less cyclical. So, when the market pulp goes very, very high, very, very fast, we go, but because \u2013 not so fast. And when the market goes down, we don't go down as fast either. So, it's a less cyclic market.","Then, of course, you have some products with sawmill which can go from fluff to SBSK (53:34) for example, so that can impact one market or the other. So this is more why I think you've seen some trend following each other. I kind of think that with time it could be that that link separates a little bit more.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks a lot, Jean-Michel. I appreciate it.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Hi, Debbie.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. I wanted to go back to Industrial Packaging. I think you addressed some of the questions on price mix and the hurricane impact. Could you talk about Europe and Brazil specifically? I think Europe was a bit lower than I was expecting? And then just kind of the outlook for both of those regions going forward?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","I can start with Brazil. Yeah, we had a slightly better quarter, which was good to see in Brazil, volume was a little bit better. We've actually been performing quite well on a volume standpoint. Our operations ran very well during the quarter in Brazil as well. We're nowhere near where we want to be, but it seems like the economy was starting to pick up a little bit more and volume was beginning to recover.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","On the volume recovery, do you have any sense of what specifically is improving and driving that? Because there's been a lot of comments about the backdrop in Brazil improving and I don't think a lot of answers as to what specifically is driving that.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","It took a little bit of a hit early in the quarter on protein, given all of the disruption from the news that you \u2013 I'm sure you've seen, related to some of the political scandals. But that didn't turn out to be as bad as we thought it might and actually recovered through the quarter. But it's fairly broad based. It just seems like economic activity is picking up broadly in Brazil over the past quarter.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","And, Debbie, in relation to the EMEA question, you're correct, couple factors. One is the seasonality in the third quarter that we spoke to, relative to box demand. The other factor is we are in the full conversion of the Madrid mill and we didn't have any \u2013 or didn't have material newsprint sales or production in the quarter, which put some stress on fixed cost absorption.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So when we look to 2018 then I'm assuming that European contribution becomes positive...","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yes.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...in that segment. Okay. And then just final question. You talked a bit about the $210 million in EBITDA for NA consumer, but \u2013 and you're going to quantify the corporate later, but were there any other one-time items that you could call out? I think there was something maybe related to maintenance. To help us just understand the deviations that we're already noticing?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Inside the $210 million adjusted EBITDA, that we're using...","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","...it was largely Augusta, Debbie.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And can you quantify that?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Well, in the quarter it was $15 million to $20 million (56:56).","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one final question this morning. Our final question will come from Dr. Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Good morning.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hi, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","You know, Mark, you've got two businesses now that are going to be reported below the EBITDA line. And I just am curious as to whether this is making you think any more about potentially kind of raising your stake in consolidating Ilim going forward?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So, Mark, the Ilim joint venture is, as you know, a very, very well advantaged business. And we continue to be happy with that investment and with our partners. And we will continue to grow that business together.","The ownership structure, if we change it ever, will be done cooperatively and collaboratively with our partners. But having it below the line isn't the driver. Making sure it's the right thing to do from a value creation.","But I understand what you're saying around getting full recognition for that powerful EBITDA generation. And that's strategically as we kind of think about what advantaged positions mean, that's one of the criteria we look at is what's the best way to structure it and make sure that it's properly recognized and that our investors can see it for what it is.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Just another one. Glenn, can you just help us with the transaction yesterday? If you guys monetize that position two plus years down the road...","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Right.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","...what's the tax implication of that?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Okay. So essentially if we sold the business outright, we would basically have a $1.2 billion (58:47) tax basis on the $1.8 billion and we'd pay 38% of that. On any appreciation above and beyond that, down \u2013 two years down the road, we do have a tax receivable agreement in place, so that would allow us to get an offset since there would be a \u2013 that we would have a gain, but the JV would also have a tax basis step up in the amount equal to that gain realized by us. So basically Graphic [Packaging] would pay us the NPV of 50% of that gain back. So, there is an offset on the accretion of the deal on taxes that we would pay if we exited our original tax exposure, less the basis.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then just a couple things on containerboard. Can you tell us, Tim, did you get any benefit from that summer corrugating medium hike?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","No, it's fairly neutral to us. We do purchase a little bit of medium through trades and so it has a modest negative impact, but it's not substantial by any means. And most of our contracts on the box side are in terms of price pass through and what not are linerboard based, there's a few that have a medium component but not many.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then can you \u2013 with regards to Riverdale, can you just help us think about sort of the potential conversion of that second machine down there, at some point how you're thinking about that?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","I think that it gives us tremendous optionality. So we look out in time and there's still good demand on the uncoated freesheet side of the business for number 16 and \u2013 but we have the option at a point in time further down the road of thinking about other uses for it.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Are there any inefficiencies in trying to run it as a split mill right now or going forward?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","No. I mean, we do that in a number of places across the system where we have a landlord and tenant making multiple products, we know how to do that. So, I don't \u2013 it actually works quite well in terms of covering all the fixed costs that are in there in everything. We did look at a point in time, what a conversion would look like, and so, we know that and it's just a matter of understanding what the business need is to support our customer growth at a point in time.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So, Mark, one thing interesting about Riverdale, it's a little unique for most of our mills, is it was built by Hammermill and it was built as two distinct process lines. So many years later, it makes the conversion to one product on one line co-existing with another product on another line, actually a pretty good fit versus mills that were built to be multi-line mills with a common pulp mill and a common backend. So it's really working in our favor now.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. That actually gets to the question I was kind of \u2013 I was really curious about. Finally, any thoughts about potentially converting white paper over to containerboard down in Brazil?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","That's not on our radar screen right now, given the two things, one is, it's probably the best place in the world to make high quality uncoated freesheet and it's \u2013 we competitively export it around the world. And two, you've got to look at the forest, and most of the Brazilian softwood is spoken for, would take a long time to plant and grow, and you got mostly eucalyptus forest. So the fiber basket is really conditioned for hardwood based grade, so at least in the near future.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Fair enough. Good luck in the fourth quarter, guys.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Mark.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Thanks.","Operator","That will conclude our Q&A session for today's call. It is now my pleasure to hand our program back over to Guillermo for any additional or closing remarks.","Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.","Thank you.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call this morning. Our key speakers this morning are John Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2013 earnings press release and today's presentation slides.","Lastly, given our expanded disclosure around our Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John Faraci.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everybody. Let me just jump right in and say in the second quarter, International Paper delivered solid performance, increasing our EBITDA by $100 million, 10% over the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of last year to over $1 billion. And importantly, we continue to generate very strong cash flow from operations and free cash flow. I'll talk about that in a minute.","We've got strong results from Industrial Packaging, driven by increased pricing, seasonally stronger volumes, coupled with, I'd say, very solid results out of Brazil and our European, Russian paper business. Those were the biggest drivers of our improved results during the quarter.","We continue to see improved business conditions in our Coated Paperboard business as evidenced by increased volume and pricing momentum that increased through the quarter. Additionally, we executed our peak outages. This was the peak quarter for outages around the world. As we come to expect International Paper, we did that on time, on budget; in some cases, came up early. We continue to control costs effectively in a challenging, both U.S. market and global environment.","And last week, we -- as we reported last Friday, we closed on the sale of the Temple Building Products business. This $710 million transaction with Georgia-Pacific, in addition to the sale of our share in a joint venture that was embedded in that building products business for $20 million, resulted in net proceeds to IP of $730 million as we expected.","Additionally, the business generated $40 million of free cash flow during the time we operated it in 2013. So I'm pleased with the results of that process, took a little longer than we thought, but I want to wish everybody in that business all the best as they join the GP team.","We did have a couple of sizable onetime items in the quarter. We took a bad debt charge of $28 million, attributable to our expected exposure with a large customer in our North American Printing Papers business, National Envelope. They filed for bankruptcy during the quarter, and we'll speak to more of the details on that shortly.","And secondly, we realized an unfavorable noncash foreign exchange swing in our Ilim Joint Venture related to a stronger dollar and the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt. But all in, a very good quarter in terms of executing well and delivering solid results.","And importantly, as I'll come to at the end, I think we're set up well for significant improvement in our earnings, cash from operations and free cash flow in the third quarter.","So moving to our financial overview slide on Slide 6. Our revenues were up about 3% quarter-over-quarter. EBITDA margins improved by 70 basis points, and cash from operations was up sequentially -- substantially quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. As I said at the outset, most importantly, free cash flow continues to grow with strong results from the second quarter, $450 million, that's up 70% from the second quarter of 2012 and up 50% in the first quarter of 2013.","As I said in the first quarter, our cash flow story remains intact and we're on track to deliver full year free cash flow for International Paper in 2013 approaching $2 billion.","So now let me turn it over to Carol. She'll give you a closer look at the quarter, and I'll come back and talk about the outlook for the third quarter and then we'll all answer your questions at the end. So Carol?","Carol L. Roberts","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the second quarter bridge from Q1, we earned $0.64 per share from continuing operations and before special items. As John said, it was a good quarter, with good improvement in pricing, seasonally stronger volumes, largely driven in Industrial Packaging, but we also saw that in our Consumer Packaging and Brazilian paper business.","Additionally, our operations and cost performance across the businesses were solid and we executed our outages very well, as John mentioned.","Miscellaneous corporate costs were lower than the higher-than-expected cost that we saw in Q1, and taxes returned to a more normalized level during the quarter of roughly 30%.","As John mentioned, the charge for the National Envelope bankruptcy hit us in the quarter. At the time of NEC's bankruptcy filing, we had a total exposure of about $42 million. We have taken steps to mitigate, and we're confident that we should be able to reduce that potential impact by about $14 million once the bankruptcy process plays out. So there for net-net, we booked a bad debt charge of $28 million in the quarter.","And finally, for the Ilim JV, we did experience a noncash FX swing that negatively impacted EPS by $0.05.","Moving to Slide 8. We experienced our heaviest planned maintenance outage quarter of the year. We executed 11 mill outages in total, all of which went as expected and this resulted in nearly 200,000 tons of capacity idled during the quarter, over -- which about half within the Industrial Packaging business.","Moving on to global input costs. It was kind of a bit of a mixed bag in the quarter, with fiber and energy providing a bit of a headwind, while chemicals actually decreased slightly in the quarter. OCC costs were up during the quarter, and wood cost negatively impacted our Printing Papers business. And I would say, looking forward, due to the weather challenges that continue to plague the Eastern U.S., we see wood cost as a growing concern and a cost headwind as we move into Q3.","So let me turn to the businesses, and start with Industrial Packaging. And as you can see, our Industrial Packaging business posted a strong second quarter as we get to see the benefits of the implementation of the April price increase. The board price increase was implemented, and box prices in North America were up on average $10 per ton quarter-over-quarter. We did see seasonally strong volume in North America and that was predominantly in our agricultural market, which is a big part of our second quarter business. And this did contribute to the improved results as well.","On the -- across the other side of the ocean, the economic conditions in our EMEA Packaging business continue to be challenged, and this impacted both pricing and volume in the quarter. What we're seeing in Europe is margins that are under pressure due to some rising board costs and lower box prices. This was made more difficult for us because of a subpar agricultural season, which was really impacted by the weather that had transpired over winter and into the spring, and this impacted our sales volume in the strong fresh fruit and vegetable segment for us.","Once again, we executed the planned annual maintenance outages well and operations remained solid throughout the quarter for the overall business.","Slide 11's one that we feel particularly good about. Improved prices, combined with solid operating results, added over 300 basis points across our business in the second quarter and this was for our North American Industrial Packaging business. EBITDA margin for this business is poised to grow further as we get further price improvement. And as we'll talk about, continued optimization of this very important and large business for the company.","Let's talk a little bit about pricing on Slide 12. As we look at the expectations around the current North American price increase, we'll see significant realization in the third quarter. The timing issue that we saw with the board purchases from the divested mills is largely behind us, and we saw that in the second quarter as we begin to realize the box price increases associated with those board purchases. We do expect to more than double our realization of the box price increase in the third quarter, and we have line of sight of full recovery as we head into the fourth quarter.","Chart 13 shows the significant growth that IP has had in the Industrial Packaging business through the acquisitions of Weyerhaeuser, and more recently, Temple-Inland. We're on a path to increase total EBITDA dollars in our North American business by more than 5x from the 2005 to 2007 level, and key to that is that has come as the result of the delivery of nearly $1 million of synergies to the bottom line, along with other key improvements to the base business. Great news is we're not done.","As we've discussed previously, we -- Mark and the team has been extremely busy integrating 2 big acquisitions over the last 5 years, so there remains a tremendous opportunity to optimize this greatly expanded business that we've built. Just to kind of put a face of that. We have a manufacturing system that comprises 17 board mills and over 160 converting plants. We ship to more than 15,000 customers and nearly 44,000 locations. So the scale and complexity of the system's great, and that's a good thing because with that comes a lot of opportunity for improvement. And we believe that we can deliver in excess of another $200 million in additional benefits over the next few years.","This comes in the areas that you would expect: improved mill performance, improved box plant efficiencies, reduced costs, streamlining the supply chain and upgrading the commercial portfolio. So all in all, a great story.","Talking some more about Industrial Packaging, let's shift our focus to the new Brazilian Packaging business Orsa IP, which we're reporting on our first full quarter since the close of the acquisition that happened on January 15. And I will remind you that we are reporting this business on a 1-month lag, so the results represented here are for the period of March ending in May.","We've very excited that the Brazilian box market continues to grow at a strong pace, roughly 4%. While we saw higher OCC cost in the second quarter that did impact our margins, we have announced and have begun implementing a box increase on the basis of that strong demand and increased input costs. We do expect the price increase to more than recover those increased costs and improve our margins.","Additionally, the Orsa IP team has structured earnings improvement plans around the synergies that we have line of sight on, productivity improvements, particularly in the mills that provides great opportunity. And we should see those kinds of benefits accruing in the third quarter. So all in all, we are very excited about the acquisition, and we remain very confident in the prospects that this business has and our ability to deliver on the commitments that we've made.","Moving on to Consumer Packaging on Slide 15. In our Consumer Packaging business, we saw improved volumes and operations, which was primarily in North America that improved overall segment profits, absent the very high heavy outage season that we saw. Market conditions in North America continue to be strong. We're seeing some price momentum through the quarter that also contributed to the results.","And as many of you've seen, as I've shown on Slide 16, you can see the significantly improved market conditions that we've been seeing over the last couple of months. This is the industry data as reported by the AF&PA and it shows that the backlog of unmade SBS orders has increased significantly over the last couple of quarters and really remains at the highest level that we've seen in the last 2 years.","We've implemented price increases since Q1, and based on this continued strong fundamentals and tight market conditions, we've announced an additional $45 per ton increase on folding carton board that we announced on July 9. So all in all, we feel good about our North American Consumer Packaging business and really feel that we've hit an inflection point and are heading in a good direction.","Moving on to Printing Papers on Slide 17. In our Printing Papers business, operating profits came in at $76 million versus $149 million in the first quarter. We did see improved pricing, driven largely by pulp in Brazil, along with seasonally stronger volumes in Brazil. Along with some benefit from market pulp price increases, we really saw an improvement in our pulp mix and this was driven largely by the successful start-up and qualification of the Franklin mill on fluff pulp.","And this is, once again, speaks to system flexibility and system capability due to the pulp system that we have and the flexibility we have. We were able to run Franklin full on 100% fluff because Riegelwood has a lot of capability. But I want to say that we've only added and introduced to the market the fluff that's required by the demand that's warranted by our customers. So at Riegelwood, we've been able to swing from fluff to softwood bales for an overall system benefit. And that's just really good news about the strength of our pulp system.","In this business, as we expected, it was our heaviest maintenance outage quarter. And additionally, as we've already talked about, we did experience the bad debt write-off of $28 million related to National Envelope.","Moving to 18, here's the results on Brazil. Brazil built on a very strong first quarter result, with even better results in the second quarter. EBITDA margins expanded to 34%, and this was driven by an increased mix of domestic business, which had better margins, some favorable FX gains and then lower operating costs associated with the new biomass boiler at Mogi, which has gone very well. I will note, however, that we did see some key export paper markets soften a bit as we headed into the end of the quarter.","xpedx, on Page 19, had a much better quarter due to improved costs in the face of, really, what I would categorize as continued challenging business conditions. And this resulted in an overall operating profit improvement of $15 million quarter-over-quarter. And the team definitely remains focused on executing the things they can control, and they are executing well against our business improvement plan.","Just a comment, as we continue to work towards our transaction with Unisource to spin and merge the businesses, as a reminder, we signed the LOI with Unisource on April 19. Since then, we've done a very -- a significant amount of work on a number of fronts, parallel path, including the continued preparation of financial information needed to facilitate the potential transaction. We continue to believe that the proposed transaction will be beneficial to both businesses and definitely to the IP share owners. And we are working toward a deal and we'll see this process play out over the next few months and through the end of the year.","So talking about our Ilim Joint Venture. On the joint venture, we have seen significant progress in the second quarter with the start-up of the capital projects at both Bratsk and Koryazhma. We've now moved from start-up to ramp-up, and we plan to reach full production capacity of these projects by year end.","Outside of the business operations, the JV did experience a negative FX impact associated with the $1 billion of U.S. denominated debt that we mark-to-market at the end of each quarter.","Taking a look at Slide 21, this clearly illustrates where the JV is with the start-up and ramp-up of the project and what's expected over the next couple of quarters. The second quarter saw the greatest impact, with start-up costs roughly double what we saw in the first quarter. And although the start-up costs will be significantly less in the third quarter, there are still costs that are associated with ramping up the new capabilities to full production that continues to be somewhat of a headwind. Ilim does expect to have the vast majority on these start-up and ramp-up costs behind us by the fourth quarter, at which time we'll really start to see more significant benefits from the project.","All in all, Ilim expects the benefits that we'll realize from the projects in '13 to outweigh the costs. However, there's no doubt that the benefits are going to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter, and more importantly, flow into next year, 2014.","So let me shift the focus now to the third quarter outlook as depicted on Slide 22. We see seasonally lower volume, and importantly, one less shipping day, which, for us, is about 40,000 tons of production in North American Industrial Packaging. And you have to remember that, for us, we have a heavy ag mix and the second quarter for this industry is just a big agricultural quarter.","While we continue to see seasonally higher volumes in Brazil papers, business conditions in Western Europe will continue to provide challenges, particularly in our EMEA Packaging business.","Overall, on price, we'll be higher in the third quarter and that's driven primarily by the North American box increase that we discussed earlier. All in all, other price mix will be largely flat, while we expect continued pressure potentially in Europe.","We continue to see solid operations, which is the largest quarter-to-quarter swing coming as a result of the non-recurrence of the National Envelope bad debt expense. We do expect some headwinds on input costs, primarily fiber, and that comes in a number of places: wood in North American papers, higher wood and energy in European and Russian papers and higher in OCC and wood in our Industrial Packaging business.","Maintenance outages will be significantly less, $94 million lower than the second quarter, which was our peak. And while the start-up costs associated with the Ilim projects will be substantially less as we spoke, ramp-up costs, along with some potential near-term risks to pulp prices in China, will likely result in a relatively flat operational quarter. And we will then have the benefit of the non-recurrence of the second quarter currency swing.","So with that outline, what I'd like to do now is turn it back over to John to summarize and wrap up.","John V. Faraci","Yes, thanks, Carol. I guess the way to summarize is I feel good about where we are and how the second half of the year is shaping up, not based on so much on a robust economic outlook, but more on our ability to execute and deliver results in the second quarter and kind of the run rate momentum we came out of the second quarter at kind of June going into July. The U.S. and global economies are still recovering. But the cash flow we're able to generate, I think, gives me encouragement that we're going to have a substantially better second half of the year than the first half.","As Carol described, we realized about 20% of the benefits of the price increase in Industrial Packaging on the second quarter and have line of sight to the rest of it in the third and fourth quarter, and that's going to continue to further expand our already industry-leading EBITDA margins.","Trends in our North America Consumer Packaging business are improving. We expect to realize improved supply-demand conditions that Carol referred to in the industry. And as you know, we made the tough decision to take down a machine at Augusta earlier in the year and that certainly improved our supply-demand balance as we look at our customer base.","The third quarter is the lowest maintenance outage period of the year. And I'm pleased and positive that the heavy lifting's behind us on the Ilim capital projects. We completed those projects. As Carol said, we're into the start-up mode now, and we'll have start-up costs. We had a lot in the second quarter. We'll have a significant amount in the third quarter. But as we get to the end of the year, those will be behind us. And at the big tailwind, those projects completed a big tailwind for International Paper and for the JV as we go into 2014.","And most importantly, we're generating strong free cash flow and we'll continue to build on this in the third and fourth quarters.","As I said last quarter, we expect to have cash -- free cash flow approaching $2 billion this year, and that outlook remains intact. Additionally, we have more clear now, which we're a year into it, a more clear line of sight into the $5 billion EBITDA we've talked about last year and I'll describe on this last slide here.","As I wrap up the call, I just want to give you an update on that. And this slide shows our expected EBITDA potential at mid-cycle margins. We're probably going to get there a different way than we outlined but the reality is International Paper's got a lot of levers to pull, so the good news is when things change, we can take advantage of opportunities and offset the challenges.","So there are some headwinds and some tailwinds. There's more runway in Industrial Packaging, which Carol shared with you. We continue to see margin expansion opportunities within that business. The optimization opportunities are huge. When you think about 5 years ago, IP had a $3 billion to $4 billion business and now it's a $12 billion business.","Beyond that, we can capitalize on our global footprint and capabilities in the Printing Papers business as we effectively and profitably move mix around the world to optimize margin opportunities.","So those are some of the tailwinds. We've got headwinds as well, mainly in the form of softer demand, probably everywhere in the world. And pulp prices that continue to be well below mid-cycle levels. The oversupply situation that was -- that exists in coated paperboard in China is going to be with us for a while. The joint venture is operating well but there's a lot of excess capacity. And we didn't see all that at the time.","So we've got pluses and minuses, but importantly, with all that said, we continue to see the potential of our portfolio as generating over $5 billion EBITDA, and that's not counting Ilim, which, as you know, is equity earnings and dividends.","So let me turn it over to the operator now, and we'll all take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, my first question is around pricing within the North American box market. I know discussion on pricing can be sensitive to talk about on a conference call, but is the pace of the increase and its implementation pretty much going as you would expect, more quickly or less quickly, and if you can give some color around that? If there is any variance, that will be great. And I had a couple of follow-ons.","Mark Stephan Sutton","George, this is Mark Sutton. Box market realization, if you remember what we said at the end of the first quarter, is about where we thought it would be. So we're on track. The $10 in the second quarter really manifested itself in the last month of the quarter. But as we left Q2, our run rate was north of $30 a ton. So we're pretty much on schedule. We have confidence that we'll have the whole price increase realized just as we did on the first one from last year before the end of this year.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And related question, just on North American containerboard and boxes, can you give us some update early in the quarter in terms of what you've seen in terms of volume, booking, whatever you feel like talking about thus far within July?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Yes, I'd be happy to. July has started off good for us. We had talked about our year-over-year comps for the last couple of quarters, and we've been tracking below our prior year comps. We're beginning to see that turn, as I mentioned a quarter ago, as we now have kind of lapped ourselves in some of the business that we were restructuring right after the Temple close. So, so far in July, we're up over last year and we're up sequentially. So we feel pretty good about it. It's early in the quarter, but we feel pretty good about it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Last one and then I'll turn it over. Clearly, National Envelope had an impact on you in the quarter and the Printing Papers business, but if I look at the detail that you provide regionally, and again, we really appreciate that, and to all the details that you provide during your presentation, it certainly was not a great profitability quarter for North American Printing Papers. What mile marker should we look to? What factors should we consider relative to what you were looking at as you look at your mill system in North American Printing Papers and whether over time you might need to further adjust that system?","Timothy S. Nicholls","George, it's Tim. Just looking at North American Printing Papers, I would say we had, outside of National Envelope, the quarter that we kind of expected we would, we could have run a little bit better. But if you look at the fundamentals around price and volume and mix, we were kind of flat from first quarter to second quarter. So we knew we were going to have a big outage quarter. We had almost $40 million more in outages. We executed those outages very well. We continue to leverage the export markets at an enterprise level to make sure that we're managing our capacity effectively. And I think that's the plan going forward. We still got opportunities to work with Europe and Brazil and make sure that we're producing product in the right place for the right markets. I also believe there's an opportunity around operations in the second half, now having our outages behind us.","John V. Faraci","George, this is John. Just let me add -- quantify that -- there's $70 million of quarter-to-quarter change in that segment that's solely attributable to the North American Printing Papers business. I mean, you take the outages in North America and National Envelope.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Fair point. So are you at cost of capital within North American Printing Papers?","Timothy S. Nicholls","We are, as we look out for the year. Now obviously, in the second quarter, we had a heavy outage quarter. But I think we're looking at it more than just quarter-by-quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Philip Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","After accounting for $1 billion of debt paydown and the proceeds from your building product sales and the free cash flow you're generating, it would imply that you probably have $1 billion in excess cash to spend. How should we be thinking about that cash being deployed over the course of the year?","Carol L. Roberts","Philip, this is Carol. Yes, that's exactly the math that we see as well. And so as we continue to look at that capital allocation, the first thing we'll do is we'll continue to reevaluate the dividend relative to that free cash flow. And today, we're in the low end of our target range of the 30% to 40% of free cash flow, so that's certainly an option. We'll continue to look at the debt. That always presents an option to see where we want to go with that. Obviously, another mechanism for returning cash to share owners could be through the form of a share buyback. So that's something that we'll look at and talk about. And then we'll also continue to look at what are the best investments for creating value for our share owners for today and tomorrow. So I think the great news is, is we have options and all of those options remain on the table.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for Consumer Packaging, demand is decent for Bleached Board, but I'm kind of surprised that backlogs have been that robust, and certainly, you guys played a role in that. Can you just give me -- us a little more perspective on what's driving that pickup there? And have you seen any impact from the ivory board capacity that's coming on from China?","John V. Faraci","Kadien, you want to take that one?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Yes, sure. I would characterize demand as much better than decent. We've seen, as you see in the chart that's in the deck, backlogs have really skyrocketed. I would say that they're not sustainable at 600,000 tons. But clearly, we've seen some rebuilding of inventory in the channels. But more importantly, our customer activity is very strong, particularly in the folding and plate areas and also in the Foodservice. So we took out capacity. There was a little bit of inventory rebuild, but we and our customers, most importantly, are feeling some real strong demand. On the buildup of capacity in Asia, we're not seeing a lot of impact on that in North America. Clearly, we're feeling it with our JV in China, but there's, I think, inventory -- excuse me, imports are up probably 20% but on a small base, and I think we're running on like 100,000 ton rate for the year. So that's really not impacting us, and certainly, not in our core segments like cup stock and folding carton.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And just sticking on that theme on China with -- and when you guys flagged how there could be some downside risk on pulp prices in China, could that weigh on your Asia business out there? Because prices -- your box board prices do kind of move with pulp prices historically, right?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Yes, we are largely nonintegrated in our joint venture, and we certainly follow pulp costs. And right now, the supply and demand is way out of balance and it's driving the pricing. So pricing is very, very competitive. And I, frankly, I don't think it can go a whole lot lower from where it is without impacting a large part of the cost curve. So I think it's bouncing around near the bottom.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Two things. Can you talk about your pan-European-North Africa container footprint? You made a strategic decision there. And this quarter's maybe sloppier performance aside, that does seem to have been the right decision. Are you satisfied with that footprint? Or do you want to grow further in converting there? And also, would you consider expanding in folding carton? And I'm not really thinking about [indiscernible]. I'm just thinking about carton in general and your Consumer Packaging footprint.","John V. Faraci","Mark, this is John. Let me take the box business in Europe first. Our box business in Europe is France, Italy, Spain, Morocco and Turkey. Morocco and Turkey are doing quite well from the demand standpoint and from a profitability standpoint. We're going to have a record year in Morocco. The -- so the geographic footprint is really in the fruit and vegetable segment for Europe and what Europe, Southern Europe, exports to other parts of the world like Russia. We like that. There's no getting around the fact that the Industrial segments in France, Italy and Spain are just what you would expect they would be, very soft. So we're going to have to manage through a difficult time, but I think we like the fact that we bought out -- our partner wanted to sell us their stake in the joint venture we had in Turkey. So now we own 100% of it. We're able to do that at what we thought was fair price and a good price and so we own 100% of that business. And we certainly are glad that we invested in Morocco when we did. Would we expand in that business? Yes, we would if we saw the right opportunity that capitalized on our existing strengths, which is really serving the fruit and vegetable market. But everything between Morocco and Turkey right now looks a little bit unstable. I think we're going to sit back and watch. Folding cartons, we like -- in North America, we like the fact that we're in the coated board business and we like being in the Foodservice business and don't see any need or reason to be in the folding carton business.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And just one quick question for Tim. You talked a bit about white paper. Can you talk about whether you're seeing more pressure in cut size? We're starting to hear that there are more deals again in cut size relative to roll. Just curious if you're seeing that.","John V. Faraci","Before Tim takes that one, Mark. The other thing I'd say is we bought out our partner in Turkey but we still have 12% that's held by the public. So -- and we're -- we don't own all of it.","Timothy S. Nicholls","It's Tim. We haven't seen any significant pressure on cut size. There are -- there's a lot of chatter in the market around imports, the threat of imports, and what might be about to happen. That's been maybe a constant theme over -- quarter-by-quarter over the past year, 1.5 years. It hasn't materialized to date in a significant way, so I think it's more buzz at this point. But there's no doubt there's some marginal tons that are flowing in. But it's marginal tons, very low quantities that are showing up episodically, and I think just one shipment gets talked about 10 times. So no, we have not seen any major pressure on cut size pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just starting with the free cash flow target for the year of approaching $2 billion. In the first half of year, hear you have about a $400 million headwind from working capital, understanding some of that's seasonally and you also had these containerboard price increases that are flowing through that can impact that. So Carol, I was hoping maybe you could kind of help us think through how you would think about working capital for the year in terms of hitting that number, given the $750 million of free cash in the first half.","Carol L. Roberts","Phil, you're correct that the consuming of the free cash for working capital in the first half of the year was driven by those 2 phenomenons: the seasonality of the business, as well as the Industrial Packaging price increase. Obviously, the Industrial Packaging price increase will stay with us, but your December sales are just very different than your end of your second quarter and even the end of your first quarter. So that will naturally reverse. And if you look underneath, we feel very good about our metrics relative to days sales outstanding, days of inventory and whatnot. So all of those metrics, we feel, are in pretty good control. So we should see a flip back on that by year end.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So you would expect to get closer to neutral.","Carol L. Roberts","I wouldn't speculate on exactly what the number is because like we said, we do have a price increase in North American Industrial Packaging, that's a pretty big business. But it won't be the consumption of working capital that we've had so far through the first 6 months.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure, okay. And then John, I know you're not trying to manage the consensus here, understood, but -- and I guess, if I just kind of look at all these moving pieces around the third quarter, the Street's at $1.15 and it seems to me that there's some headwinds here. So any way you could kind of put a bogey around how we should think about the earnings side of things for this quarter, just to kind of calibrate? I mean, it seems like it might be closer to $1 to me, but I may be off. I was hoping you could maybe put a little bit of parameter on that.","John V. Faraci","We don't give guidance, as you know, and the way I think about it is, where are we going from the second quarter? And we see significant improvement in earnings and cash from operations and free cash flow in the third quarter. And then that's based on how we executed in the second quarter, the run rate in June and what we're seeing at the beginning of July. So I think about a significant improvement in earnings from the second quarter.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then the last question, just on input costs. Any change to your view on this $200 million headwind? I think that you had thought about before for the year in light of what you've talked about with these higher wood prices and other inputs.","Carol L. Roberts","Phil, I would say that things come and go and so I still think that's a good planning assumption for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Mark, how would you characterize your North American containerboard inventories at this point? Are they as high as you would like them to be?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Adam, I'd say we had a big outage first half of the year, so it was very difficult for us to make any real progress in inventory. So I'd say, in general, we're still a bit on the lean side. We got to learn something in the fourth quarter last year that we will try not to repeat this year in terms of heading into heavy outages with the, not only the amount, but the quality of the inventory, meaning, the right grades and the right location. So I'd say we're still a little bit on the lean side right now.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And John, just 2 for you. One is, can you characterize the changes in economic trends in the regions in which you operate in recent weeks? Any notable changes in June or to this point in July?","John V. Faraci","I think it's more of the same. Every place is a little different, but it's really more of the same.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one more, John. As you know, The Wall Street Journal published an article not too long ago about the Ilim Joint Venture and about the risks associated with that investment. Would you care to comment on that?","John V. Faraci","Yes, I would. I mean, our view -- my view is the article missed important aspects of the story around the joint venture with our Russian partners. And first of all, that joint venture is unique in our industry, but we're in year 6 of what had been very successful commercially, if you look at the impact on International Paper. We've got good governance, and we've got a strong and effective board and joint venture management. And the kind of -- the reality is, here's an example of a Russian company, U.S. company coming together, doing something that neither of us could do on our own. We just completed $1 billion of capital projects to expand, upgrade and modernize and improve the environmental footprint of an important industry in Russia. That project in Siberia is one of the biggest ones in the industry, in Russian industry, I think, in over 30 years. And in one way, we're helping to diversify the Russian economy and business in an industry where they're very competitive, and that's forest products industry. And finally -- or you see it favored by both the Russian and the U.S. government. And I guess, finally, I'd say that the working relationship and trust and mutual respect we've built together over the last 6 years is real, it's important and it's the key reason the joint venture has been successful. So overall, we think it's -- the story about the joint venture is a positive one with a lot of upside and so we're pleased with both JV and the partnership. The joint venture has been successful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In Industrial Packaging, you had a good price realization, but you also called out a 3% volume decline year-over-year in North American container. And I'm just wondering, is there anything that happened in the quarter in terms of share shift or maybe some account rationalization with Temple that you can point out that would explain the volume decline, especially in light of what sounded like a pretty good ag season?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Anthony, the year-over-year volume decline has been a bit of a trend for the last several quarters. And most of it is related to the -- 2 things, really, the acquisition and integration of Temple in the first half of last year. We made some changes commercially to some business that we had. There were some business that Temple was in the process of losing as we closed on the deal. And then as we implemented the price increase last fall, we made further commercial decisions. And so all that business was in last year's comps and it's not in this year's. But we feel real good about our volume trend now in the first quarter and in the second quarter. We've rebuilt some of that volume that we moved away from. And we talk about this. We're overweighted in some segments as a result of 2 big acquisitions and maybe some segments that have struggled a little bit more in this economy versus some other segments. So we're working to rebalance our segment portfolio. And then we have the other 2 channels that we believe are important and I think our margins show the results of that. We feel strongly about the open market in the domestic sense, and we feel strongly about the export open market for kraft linerboard. And so we look at all 3 of those segments and adjust our sales revenue through those segments on a continuous basis to optimize the business and looking at the margins and a few other metrics as our guide.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. Maybe just switching to the box side in Europe. You referenced some pressure on box prices and a weaker ag season in Europe. And I'm just wondering, as you exited the quarter and into July, are you seeing that price pressure continue? Are you seeing any stabilization? Or any kind of comments you can give on European box prices currently?","John V. Faraci","I don't think we're seeing a lot of -- there's always pressure; it's a competitive business. So to say there's no pressure on box prices would not be correct. But we're not seeing weak box prices. What's happened is there's been a little bit of compression on margins because containerboard prices have gone up and box prices haven't. There's been a bit of a mix shift and so some of the realization loss we have is not price related, it's mix related. We had a plant in Italy. It was destroyed by an earthquake. We rebuilt that plant, and in the process, we kept most of the customers but some of the customers moved some business in other directions. And so we've got some work to do to rebuild our mix, but I wouldn't say there's a lot of pressure on box prices in Europe other than the normal competitive activity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman of UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Carol, can you talk maybe a little bit more about how you think about debt? And specifically, where you see the pension falling? And as you look towards applying the GP, the building products sale proceeds and the rising EBITDA that you're expecting in the back half, how you think you'll be looking at debt as you exit the year?","Carol L. Roberts","Sure, Gail. Well, let me just talk about the pension real quickly. And as you know, with interest rates rising, the higher discount rate helps on the liability side. And so the rule of thumb for International Paper is about 100 basis points is equivalent to $1.5 billion of liability, given where Treasuries ended at the end of the -- or at least at point of time today. That's probably a $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion reduction in our unfunded liability. And that's all good news. That helped, primarily really, from a credit metric perspective, and then longer term, it should help on the funding side. So that said, the way we think about debt is we want to pay some more debt down. We want to pay that debt down effectively. We've got a number of choices to do that. Now that we've gotten the funds from the building products, we're in a position to work on that. I mean, we've got a great treasury group who's looking at those options. So we're still thinking that the debt reduction for the company this year is going to be in the $600 million to $700 million range of net debt reduction by the time the year is over. That's kind of our planning from this point. And we've also made the one pension cash contribution that was required for 2013. That was only $31 million, but we've taken care of that and that's done.","John V. Faraci","Still a lot of room, Gail, for this year and certainly more next year for a very balanced use of cash that we've talked about with all of you over time. We're still committed to that. I think we're generating the cash to be able to make decisions consistent with that.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And Mark, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of export markets for board? Any changes there?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Gail, the export markets, we saw price increases through the second quarter. I think we're heading into what generally is a seasonally slower period in some of the export markets. We're in pretty much all of them to some degree. So I think we see a stable outlook as we head into the second half of the year, both on volume and probably a pricing standpoint. But the third quarter, in particular, tends to be on balance across the export regions a bit of a seasonally slower period from a demand standpoint.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just in terms of inflation, the wood cost inflation that you're discussing, is that really just weather related? Is there anything more fundamental with OSB mills restarting and anything else that will be pressuring prices?","John V. Faraci","It's weather related, Gail. We've seen that OSB and wood products pressure all year because housing has been coming back quite strong. It's -- I think we got 20 inches of rain in the Riegelwood area in the 40-day period. So we got a lot of mills over in that area of Eastover, Georgetown, Augusta, Riegelwood. So the East side is getting hit harder for us than the West.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question. In terms of fluff pulp, are you starting to see any benefit or impact in the market with Rayonier having completed the conversion at Jesup?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes, Gail, it's Tim. I wouldn't characterize it that way. I think we're generally seeing fluff pulp continue to grow at the rate similarly that we expect it to. For us, we're bringing on capacity this year that Carol referenced that we're bringing on, trying to, in the most intelligent way possible. So out of the 300,000 ton increment of additional capacity we're probably going to be around 200,000 that flows to the fluff pulp markets. Having said that, we'll get a better benefit out of Franklin because we're going to try to run and we will be out of 300,000 run rate in Franklin on fluff but we'll balance it out with other mill operations on the softwood side. So we still see 4% annual growth on fluff and no real new capacity coming on. So as capacity comes out, it should help but we haven't seen it materially yet.","Operator","Our final question will be coming from Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just have some segment questions. First of all, you mentioned that you were seeing some weakness in some of the export uncoated free sheet markets in -- toward the end of the second quarter. Can you give us a little color on that?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes, Mark, it's Tim. I think a part of it is just seasonal impact. We're in one of the dog days of summer and we saw some markets slow toward the end of the second quarter, continue into the first part of July. I don't expect that to last for the rest of the quarter or the rest of the year. But -- and it's not a significant downturn. It's just on the margin.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then for Mark Sutton, I noticed, Mark, on some of the presentations recently, you guys have been putting on a little dotted line for that idled machine up at Valliant. And I just wondered if you can give us a little color on how you think about that machine, particularly with the industry operating at a very high operating rate right now?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Sure, Mark. There's a machine at Valliant, along with a number of other small opportunities, are things we constantly evaluate to make sure we've got the right capacity and the right geographic locations and the right mix between virgin and recycled liner. So we'll monitor the market. We also -- John mentioned and Carol mentioned the optimization opportunity is a big part of that, is really examining that 17 mill system and ending up with the best footprint we can. So we don't have any immediate plans for that particular asset that you mentioned, but it's definitely something that if we need to, for either volume or cost reasons to deploy it, we would.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Would the roll-off, Mark, of that new India agreement would that make that restarted Valliant more attractive to you?","Mark Stephan Sutton","It could. I mean, part of what we're doing right now is, what you mentioned, new India. And also from Hood Container, we're buying on a 3-year plan, 2 years left of products from these divested mills. And if it makes sense for us to internalize some of that demand in the future and it likely could, that might play into our plans for internalizing that.","John V. Faraci","Think of it this way, Mark. If we had to, it takes 18 months plus to do a retrofit of some machine or a greenfield. We can bring on Valliant capacity very quickly, very cost-effectively if the demand was there. And we're going to manage the businesses [indiscernible] to our supply and demand, but we can move very quickly and it would be very cost-effective because we kept the machine and capability basically intact.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, I just wondered, since we've got Tom Kadien on the line, Tom, can you give us a little color on how the Sun joint venture is operating right now? What kind of volumes? Where that product is being sold and kind of pricing?","John V. Faraci","Tom may not be on but I'd say the -- let me answer that, Mark, quickly. The joint venture is operating well. Operationally, everything is running very well. It always happens when the market is oversupplied. Pricing, as Tom said, has probably hit bottom but there are no signs that it's going to improve next quarter. So we're seeing more of the same. That volume is staying in China. There's very little of it that's -- some is going outside of China to the region, but we're not exporting it all over the world. We have Coated Paperboard business in Russia and Poland and the U.S. and China, so we know overall what we're [ph] all doing. And that capacity was set up to serve the high end of the Chinese market, not necessarily the commodity and the folding boxboard market.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And John, is there any -- in the Bleached Board market, is the Augusta machine just gone forever? Or given the tightness in the market, could you ever see bringing that back?","John V. Faraci","You consider that out. We don't consider that an idle machine like [indiscernible].","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Like Valliant.","John V. Faraci","Well, let me just summarize for everybody, a solid performance in the first quarter. We're pleased, but the important thing is we've got more runway ahead and you can see that in the third quarter. We're set up well for significant improvement in earnings, cash from operations and free cash flow in the third quarter, and we'll be starting to talk to you about how we see 2014 as the year unfolds.","So thanks for being on the call. We'll talk to you next quarter.","Jay Royalty","Thanks to all. Thanks for taking the time to join us this morning. As always, Michelle and I will be available after the call. Our phone numbers on Page 25 of the Appendix. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Royalty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jay Royalty","Thank you. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining international Paper's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2016 earnings, press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint ventures, financial information and statistical measures. ","With that I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, Jay. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call and Thank you for your interest in International Paper. I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered a strong second quarter with solid contributions from our key businesses across our enterprise, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 17.6% which is 50 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $527 million. Operations performed well and a heavy quarter of maintenance outages was executed very effectively. The recently converted machine at the Riegelwood mill is running well and on schedule with our expectations.","On the portfolio front, we completed the sale of the Asia box business and closed on the purchase of the Madrid mill. We have an agreement with Holmen to produce newsprint which they will sell until we start the recycle container work conversion in mid-2017. We expect the converted mill to be up and running in the fourth quarter of 2017. And in early May, we announced that we reached an agreement with Weyerhaeuser to buy their pulp business and we expect to close on that transaction in the fourth quarter.","I'm pleased to reported that we successfully completed the lump sum buyout program for our term vested employees in the IP pension plan which we initiated to further derisk the plan, consistent with our balance sheet strategy. Finally, Ilim joint venture delivered another solid quarter of performance and International Paper received a $58 million dividend in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 6 and speaking a little more specifically to the financial results for the quarter. Revenue was down year over year, primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China and the sale of our Carolina brand of coated bristols last year. EPS of $0.92 represented strong performance coming off a solid first quarter. And as you can see in the chart on the right, return on invested capital for the first half of 2016 was solidly above our cost of capital at 10.6%.","This is an important metric that we watch very closely because it's a good indicator of whether IP is creating value for our shareholders over time. When we run our businesses well and when we deploy capital in a value-creating way, we see this metric improve. We've had six consecutive years above our cost of capital and we've been on an upward improvement trend for several years.","All in all, I am pleased with our performance in the quarter and the first half of 2016. With that introduction, I'm going to turn it over to Carol Roberts to cover the business highlights and the outlook for the third quarter.","Carol Roberts","Thanks, Mark. Good morning. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a strong quarter at $0.92 EPS, driven by seasonably stronger volume and good operational performance. Prices were lower, as expected and I will put some color on this as we get into the various business segments. We successfully executed a heavy outage quarter that was slightly lower than the first quarter due to less downtime from the mill conversion process at Riegelwood. And results for the Ilim JV were slightly lower than the first quarter, mainly due to planned maintenance outages in the quarter and some modest cost inflation.","Turning to the business segment and beginning with industrial packaging, the business had another strong quarter, driven by seasonably stronger volume, good operational performance and some benefit from input cost. These were partially offset by lower containerboard export prices and lower box prices, due to the impact of the January Container Board Index change, Contract renewals and a slightly favorable -- less favorable mix. Maintenance outage expenses were higher as well. The North American system took 85,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter to match our supply with our demand.","Turning to Slide 9, I want to highlight some of the key levers we have within IP's North American Industrial Packaging business that enable us to build upon what is already a great business and make it even better. Our sales teams and designers are working with our customers every day to redesign packaging, leverage innovation and find ways to take cost out,. IP has a low-cost, world-class mill system, along with a vast box and specialty plant footprint with a diverse range of capability. And that footprint serves thousands of customers across every consumer segment. We're always working to improve our portfolio of business and grow with the highest value customers and we have a portfolio of customers and product second to none in the industry.","On the manufacturing and supply chain front, our teams are using the most advanced tools and techniques to drive efficiency improvement and cost reduction. And this of course, positively impacts our margin. As Mark mentioned, we're committed discipline and targeted capital investment program, in the right places to maintain and improve this world-class system. For example, over the last few years, we have implemented a couple hundred million dollars of cost reduction projects in the areas of consumption reduction that have IRRs greater than 25%. We continue to have a robust pipeline of these types of opportunities across our broad network. As I said, lots of levers that have contributed to our success and will continue to do so as we move forward.","Slide 10, moving now to consumer packaging, the business experienced a much improved quarter, driven by good operation, effective cost management and the lack of maintenance outages. Prices were slightly lower on folding carton and plate stock but this was fully offset by a more favorable mix. Within this segment, our Foods Service business benefited from increased volume as we moved through the summer cold cup season. In printing papers, earnings improved due to lower outage costs associated with the Riegelwood mill conversion, partly offset by a less favorable product mix and lower pulp prices.","The negative $11 million in the price mix bucket is fully attributable to the less favorable mix associated with the ramp-up in qualification of the newly converted machine in Riegelwood. Paper volume was higher in Europe and Brazil and it is also worth noting that the significantly lower outage expense in pulp was partially offset by higher planned maintenance outage expense across the remaining paper business.","Turning now to Ilim, the JV turned in another solid quarter of performance with volumes up almost 5% year over year. The JV had planned maintenance outages at two of the mills which negatively impacted earnings. FX was generally stable throughout the quarter and as Mark mentioned, IP received a dividend of $58 million during the quarter. The outlook for IP equity earnings for the third quarter is generally in line with the quarter just completed. But I would note that there was a positive gain of $0.01 on FX related to the JV's U.S. denominated debt in the second quarter that we assume will not repeat in the third quarter.","Turning to Slide 13, before I move on to the outlook, I would like to give an update on actions we've taken or are planning to take around continued prudent management of IP's pension plan. As we previously disclosed in the first quarter 10-Q, we offered a voluntary pension buyout for term vested former employees. We completed the program and made the associated payments in the second quarter.","We paid a total of $1.2 billion to approximately 25,000 former employees out of plan assets, settling the corresponding liability in keeping with our strategy to take risks off the table. A requirement of settling a liability of this magnitude resulted in IP taking a non-cash settlement charge of $439 million or $270 million after-tax for unamortized actuarial losses which impacted our non- operating pension expense for the quarter.","Additionally, we elected to make a voluntary contribution of $250 million to the plan in the second quarter. And we plan to make additional contributions of $500 million by the end of the year. Based on our analysis, we believe these contributions make good sense in light of the tax benefits as well as the fee savings and is consistent with our strategy of derisking the plan over time and managing our balance sheet.","So, on Slide 14 moving to the third quarter outlook, volume is expected to be mostly stable across the businesses, with the exception of EMEA packaging which will be lower due to normal seasonality in Morocco. Price for the quarter is expected to be lower in North American industrial packaging due to the flow-through effect of the January PPW Index change. This will negatively affect earnings by about $10 million.","To a slightly lesser extent, earnings are expected to also be impacted by a less favorable mix in the pulp business as the majority of the tons coming off the new capacity at Riegelwood during ramp-up will be market softwood rolls. All other pricing should be largely stable.","Operations are expected to continue to perform well and input costs, particularly energy and OCC in North America are expected to be higher in the third quarter by roughly $35 million. Maintenance outage expenses are forecasted to be lower by about $60 million. IP equity earnings from the Ilim JV are expected to be relatively flat, assuming a stable FX. With this assumption, there would be a non-repeat of the favorable $0.01 gain from FX on the JV's U.S. denominated debt in the prior quarter.","And as you can see there are a few other minor items noted on the chart. I would also note that several of the trends we're seeing, as we move into the third quarter, such as input costs are likely to impact the fourth quarter as well. So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, Carol, so before I wrap things up, I wanted to take a moment to touch on the strategic opportunity we announced during the quarter that IP has reached an agreement to acquire the assets of Weyerhaeuser for the pulp business. When we complete the transaction, International Paper will be a premier global producer of fluff pulp, with a strong position in North America and the ability to serve growing global markets.","This strategic combination will also provide us with a talented team and superior research and development capabilities, including a valuable patent portfolio that will enable IP to better serve customers and make our combined businesses more competitive and more profitable. The valuation around the acquisition is very compelling and offers an attractive all-in multiple, along with solid double-digit financial returns through real and significant synergies and low integration risk. Again, we're very pleased with this acquisition and the integration opportunity ahead of us and look forward to strengthening this business and the rest of International Paper.","Moving to Slide 16, I want to briefly come back to the bigger picture for International Paper as we've evolved over the last 18 months or so. Our strategy is to produce fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper where we have advantage production positions and we serve advantaged markets. When we choose the right products, make them in the right places and serve the right markets and the right customers and when we execute very effectively, we generate the greatest value for our customers and our shareholders.","Looking at the recent decisions we've made, I believe our actions in Asia, the improvement in our North American Industrial Packaging business, the investment in European packaging and the opportunity of our Riegelwood Mill conversion and the purchase of Weyerhaeuser's fluff pulp businesses are all consistent with this strategy.","So, in closing, I am encouraged how, by how International Paper continues to consistently perform in a challenging and changing global environment. Our focus is squarely on execution, from working closely with our customers to deliver superior value to running and improving our operations, to driving cost out of our system and supply chain, all to maintain and improve margins, as you've seen IP do over the last several years.","Our financial discipline is evident from our constant vigilance to maintain a strong balance sheet through the rigorous capital allocation. We're committed to strengthening our portfolio businesses and to increase the value of the Company and ensure an attractive future for IP and our shareholders.","Finally, we remain intensely focused on strong free cash flow generation and delivering returns well above our cost of capital to drive shareholder value. With that, I would like to turn it back over to the operator and open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities.","Chris Manuel","Carol, I just wanted to kind of come back to the pension item, if I could, for one second. I mean, as you now have this done, it looks like as a chunk that might go out this year, what might we -- how should we think about pension expense for IP, as I think you've got $360 million-ish or so running through this year, how might that change next year in 2017 both for expense and then cash out, et cetera, requirements?","Carol Roberts","So, a good question, Chris, so just one comment, relative to what will flow through the P&L next year from a service cost, I don't anticipate any big change relative to the service course. Of course, that goes through the P&L, as you would expect, again, on the non-operating pension expense, that moves around a bit. I would say directionally, given that we have settled out this current liability related to the buyout, in theory, it should go down some due to that but we won't know until we see how the end of the year comes, how interest rates come out and all the things that goes into that equation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies.","Philip Ng","You guys had a very strong quarter on the operations front on consumer, can you give a little more color on that improvement? Is that stable going forward?","Mike Amick","The operating cost associated with consumer was strong on a number of fronts. We had really good operations. We believe that is sustainable. Part of the cost picture was also the -- not having the Augusta outage which occurred in the first quarter. We don't have any outages in the third quarter as well, so we feel exceptionally confident about our runnability and our performance moving forward. The other thing I would add to this is we have made some pretty good headwinds around our supply chain cost and our cost to serve as well. So I am very encouraged about that in the context of certainly the quarter and our outlook.","Philip Ng","Okay and I guess switching gears a little bit onto your printing paper business. If I look at your heat map chart, it is citing flattish price or a stable price? I would have thought with the increases in the marketplace, you would have seen an uptick. Is some of that being offset by lower pulp prices? Thanks.","Mike Amick","You're referring to the page in the Appendix. Again, this is Mike Amick. Overall, prices are going up in papers and we expect that to continue to happen, as you can expect and would appreciate, mix comes into this thing, freight lines come into this thing from a transaction price standpoint. But overall, our paper prices are moving up. It could be -- it's just a factor of timing, a lot of times, more than anything else, Philip.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub","So just first -- actually one follow-up on the paper pricing. So is it reasonable to anticipate that, in the fourth quarter which actually typically though we see something weak for pricing in paper but should we see that the lagged impact and see better pricing in the fourth quarter, assuming no change in the marketplace from where things have trended? And then, additionally, if we could get some more color on what you're seeing in the Industrial Packaging business, an update on market conditions with some reasonably favorable data as of late?","Mike Amick","So Mark, this is Mike again, so to make sure I answered your question, the lack -- you were breaking up a little bit. The lack of what? Which?","Mark Weintraub","Basically, should we be anticipating that the prices would be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter due to the lagged impact of price increases going through?","Mike Amick","Well, what we're not going to do is really forecast on pricing, as we shared with you in the last call, this is going to be, more or less, a second-half event. We will -- do expect to see prices to move as we kind of move forward. Where we settle out on the fourth quarter, there is still a fair amount of water under the bridge to pass there, so let's stay tuned for that as we report out on for -- the fourth quarter, okay?","Mark Weintraub","Sure.","Timothy Nicholls","Market conditions, so far, I think are roughly in line with what we expected, through the first half, of the year on box. A little bit uneven from month to month, but overall, pretty much what we expected and I think we continue to look at 1% to 1.5% growth for the full year. So, I think in line with how we were thinking about it. On the export side, demand continues to be good for craft liner. Markets seemed like they started to firm as we went through the second quarter so we will have to see how that plays out, but on balance, it feels as expected and pretty stable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America.","George Staphos","I had a couple of questions, maybe first seguewaying a little bit off of Mark's question. So, should we assume that if the outlook is 1% to 1.5% in growth for industrial that, that is what you've been seeing early in the third quarter, Tim? And have you seen any effect at all from Brexit in terms of customer expectations in Europe or even relative to the U.S.? Again, it would appear that we haven't but just wanted to ask that for the record.","Timothy Nicholls","Yes, so far, third quarter looks like it's playing out pretty much as we expected. In terms of Brexit, I will just speak for a containerboard, because there is a whole European business apart from what we do here in North America. But we have a very small position in the UK, so from a containerboard export standpoint, we don't expect any significant impact at all.","Mark Sutton","For the Company as a whole, the first order of effect is the Brexit action is pretty minor, given our market positions there. We really don't make any products in the UK. We do serve the market. Second order, I think everybody is still trying to figure that out.","George Staphos","My question is probably more on the second order than on the first order but I understand why there would be a little bit of lack of clarity at this juncture. Two other questions and then I will turn it over. Carol, can you talk a little bit -- or Tim, can you talk a little bit about what additional cost reduction opportunities you might have? What other leverage you might have to optimizing the mills? I think the number that's been cited in the past and again, on this call was around $200 million. ","And as you ultimately achieve that, as you look out another couple of years, does it get harder to get increased in improvement -- performance improvements at that level, given that you're already so low on the cost curve? That's question number one and then question number two, just a quickie, can you update us all on any things to be mindful of in terms of the progress and the process with the Weyerhaeuser closing? Thank you.","Timothy Nicholls","I'll just take the first part and Carol can jump in, but I will take the first part of the question around cost optimization. We feel like it's a pretty rich environment. When you've got such a large system, we move, on average, 200,000 tons a week from our mills to our box plants. So, a lot of productive capacity, a lot of supply chain. We've got people working in all of those spaces, looking for value creation, waste elimination-type opportunities, so is it easy? No, it is not easy. We worked pretty hard at it, but I think it's a pretty rich environment for us.","Mike Amick","George, on Weyerhaeuser, as you know, we're going to the regulatory approval process. We've done this a couple of times in the recent past. In our experience, would say things are going as you would expect them to go. We still expect to close in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Year-to-date, we've seen a really large number of acquisitions of independent box plants by some of your competitors. And I was wondering if you could just talk, maybe generally about how that's changed the commercial environment or if it's changed the commercial environment or has it impacted, the ton you sell into the open market? Or have you had to shift your board sales around?","Just wondering if you could speak to that. And then in terms of your own integration rate, can you remind us, do you have a target integration rate or a preferred method for growing on integration rate or any thoughts you could share would be helpful.","Mark Sutton","Yes, let me start with the last and work backwards, on integration, we don't have a target. What we want to do is pick the right segments, pick the right customers and where we can deliver value proposition, take great positions and then grow with those customers over time and then it will be what it will be. We like our integrated channel. We like it here in North America. We also like it in the other parts of the world where we ship more to our converting businesses there. So we also like the two other channels that we participate in.","In terms of the acquisitions, it hasn't impacted us directly. We haven't had to make any types of shifts and I don't think it -- from my standpoint, it's one opinion but I don't think it has yet had any material impact on the size of the independent market or it's very fragmented. There is a lot of players in that space. So we haven't seen any direct impact caused by acquisitions over the past few years at this point.","Anthony Pettinari","And then just a follow-up, you do have a decent sized presence in Turkey, given the events there. Have you seen any disruption to your shipments or your people there? And are you taking any steps to manage risk into the second half?","Mark Sutton","So, specifically to the events of the past couple of weeks, no, we have not seen any major impact. I think you look at that region of the world and Turkey, because of just where it is located approximate to some of the unrest, we've seen demand -- economy underperform and some diminishment of demand. But overall, it is a very good market for us. We believe in it long term and we manage day-to-day to balance out the risks that we have. But we've still got a sizable presence there and like it very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon","The question I have the first one is on the maintenance situation. It looks like you guys are I guess doing better than you thought you would. If I go back about six months, it looks like your expense was scheduled to be around $534 million for the year. And then in April, that fell to $508 million and now it's down to $462 million for the year. And I didn't know if that was more of a function of deferring or were you finding better ways to do what you'd normally do?","Carol Roberts","Chip, this is Carol and I will take a shot at that. I think it is both. I think we always look to find better and smarter ways to execute outages. I think we're also making choices about what works, do we need to do, do we have some headwinds against our expectations for the year. So Mark has challenged the organization pretty hard about what are some of the options we have. And then we have got a very large global footprint so one mill is -- we don't break it out at the level of detail but there is some work that we have been able to push into the next year with extending outage cycles.","So it's all of the above and the main story here is it continues to be an important part of the work we do, vital to our running well, but we're going to spend our dollars very, very wisely. And so I think that's what you're seeing and we'll try to continue to provide the transparency such that you can see how that evolves through time.","Mark Sutton","Chip, I would just add on top of that, it is a strategy for us to get better in this area. So each year, we deploy more predictive tools than we did the year before. And that leads us to making different decisions in where we spend money and what we have to repair versus what we thought we had to repair. And we will continue to get better at that, there is a lot of technology and techniques, precision maintenance techniques and predictive tools that help you work on just what needs to be worked on. And we're getting better at that every year.","Chip Dillon","Okay, good. And one other question, is when I look at the balance sheet, the pension number has risen from about $3.5 billion to a little over $4 billion and I would assume that includes the impact of what you just settled and the $250 million. And so I guess my question is, when we include the $500 million you're going to put in the second half.","And if we were to assume rates stay about where they are, would that be a fair number to see on the balance sheet or close to a fair number we should expect to see at the yearend again, assuming no change in rates from here?","Carol Roberts","Yes, Chip and the one clarification which I think I stated but if I didn't, I want to be clear, with this program that we did, it did require a remeasurement of the plan which normally we wouldn't be doing at the end of June. We would remeasure the plan at the end of the year, so the liability that shows on the balance sheet has been impacted by the very low interest rates that hit at the end of the June which was a combination of all kinds of things going on the globe.","So a couple of things will happen, one is we will have a half of year of asset performance. We'll have the contributions that go in and we will also remeasure the plan, depending upon how interest rates move from June 30 for International Paper to the end of the year. So, yes, you are thinking about it correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones","A call earlier this week, I think one of your competitors, was asked about the ability to get permitting for craft mill capacity in the U.S. and suggested they didn't think it was really possible or more difficult. I was wondering if you could just give us your thoughts on that because I think it's important, not only for the fluff pulp business, but also longer term craft containerboard mill assets in the U.S.. I think the conventional wisdom has been that, that was impossible.","Mike Amick","Debbie, I think we haven't tried to permit a new pulp mill in awhile in the U.S. so we can't speak from actual experience recently, but we think, just based on some of the things we know about existing mills and the way that you have to operate wood pulping operations, it's a pretty difficult process to imagine happening.","Debbie Jones","And then my follow-up question, just we haven't talked about D&A or CapEx that much on the call. Is the $1.3 billion still a good number for the year for each?","Carol Roberts","Debbie, this is Carol, I think the number is probably trending closer to $1.25 billion and that is a combination of a couple of things. One is we're on unit of operation, so as we run our North American containerboard system, we -- people can -- you can see our utilization of those assets has impacted it. So it has come down a little bit from our original expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn from RBC Capital Markets.","Paul Quinn","Just a question on synergies with the prospective purchase of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business, just noting that whereas you got the $28 million in cost savings in 2014, $47 million; in 2015, they were targeting $40 million; to $50 million in 2016 so that totals $120 million and you are expecting $175 million. So I'm just wondering where that $175 million, where the major buckets are and is there that much synergy left in the business?","Mark Sutton","I think the $175 million we feel really good about and it's in the categories that we have demonstrated when you put two really good businesses together, you can find it. SO some of it's obviously an overhead, but sourcing and how we buy all the inputs and get synergies there. And big one for this business is supply chain, in bound supply chain, outbound supply chain and probably most importantly, making the right products at the right facility. So that your total cost to serve is the lowest and your total manufacturing cost is the lowest. There's other optimization opportunities but that's really the buckets that will drive the synergies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman from Roe Equity Research.","Gail Glazerman","I was wondering if you could give a little bit of color on fiber cost, both wood and OCC? So your wood costs have been coming down pretty nicely. You seem to be at a couple-year low; is that a trend you would expect to continue and just any thoughts on what has been driving the recent uptick in OCC and do you expect that to continue?","Carol Roberts","I'm going to comment on the wood and then I think I will probably let Tim comment on the OCC. The wood is a combination of effects. It's --have been -- I think we would have described it in years past as stubbornly high which it was above historic levels. For us, it has come down and that's been a combination of weather, of strategy, of inventories, of a lot of things that are going on.","So we're pleased to see that. And we're hoping that the current level of wood cost will continue. We've got some concerns about other input headwinds and wood, quite honestly, is not one of the ones that we're anticipating, so a pretty good story on wood and then I will let Tim comment on the OCC.","Timothy Nicholls","I would just say more of a pull from China which is having some impact. You've seen prices in China go up over the past couple of months. Maybe because there is a little bit less generation of locally-sourced OCC in country, but I think this is what we expect, a normal type of variation around OCC pricing as we go through the year. It's going to up; it's going to go down based on generation and usage. Our long term view is that it will continue to rise over time, but I think this is just a normal seasonal type of variation that we're experiencing at the moment.","Gail Glazerman","And just on consumer board, we're I guess four to five months into the start of the MESA board project, been only a week or two into the start of the Kaukau mills but I'm just wondering if you could give some perspective, particularly given your position in the European market, how -- where that board is going and how it is impacting the markets, if at all in any global region?","Mike Amick","I can start here, we know that from an import standpoint, that we've seen imports in North America up, let's call it roughly 10% to 12%. That is off of a fairly smaller base so it amounts to about 20,000 tons and we know that some of the product is here. We haven't seen it at an appreciable level right now, so from a significant standpoint, at least at this state, nothing significant in North America.","Mark Sutton","Gail, I think in the European context, we redesigned our product offering out of our Kwidzyn mill and it's a real specialty, high-end, high-yield board and so the customers we have in the segments we play in, we haven't seen any disruption. I do think that board you mentioned is finding its way into some of the market, but not exactly in the spot that we're.","Gail Glazerman","Okay and just on that, any sense that it's causing a repatriation of exports domestically? Is it fine for global markets?","Mark Sutton","Directly, we've certainly seen some, as you see published, a drop in exports here in North America, particularly around SBS but attributing that to a specific event is a little bit, would be a little bit challenging to do at this stage.","Mike Amick","I don't think we've had a personal experience with our export customers and have made -- closing a position to that particular product, but could it be happening more broadly? I think we'll figure that out, but we haven't had that exact experience.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark Connelly","First question is on consumer, that business has now been cut back with Sun and all that and it's now at a point where the business looks pretty good and attractive but the scale is small enough that we're starting to wonder what its significance is. Do you see enough opportunities to grow that business over the next couple of years, whether it is internal spend or M&A, consistent with the strategy that you've laid out? And if you do, is that going to be more likely in the U.S. or elsewhere?","Mark Sutton","The consumer business is still an important business and you think about that strategic framework around fiber-based packaging. It fits squarely in there and we have a niche business, that's no doubt. SBS on the board side and one type of converting but we also have in Europe, a very good, also niche, high-end FBB business.","When you take them all together, our challenge internally is to figure out the ways that we can create value by improving those business and\/or growing, but when you put the two together and you look at the size of International Paper, they are not insignificant in the size of our Company. The ways to improve -- there are the ways you would imagine, should we make more converting? Should we offer other substrates? That is constantly in our strategic evaluation. And I wouldn't necessarily comment on whether we would do more or do less or more in another part of the world, but the U.S. business and the consumer behavior for these types of products is pretty strong.","Mark Connelly","And the second question, I was happy to see that you highlighted the higher-value pulps beyond fluff that you're going to have in your portfolio. Those have not gotten a lot of attention and of course, IP has some historical experience there. Is that an opportunity, do you expect to try to expand now that you've got this nicer, deeper portfolio?","Mark Sutton","I think, the way to create value in a specialty fibers business is obviously to continue to trade up to the higher value, whatever the product is doing for the customer and some of those higher value pulps provide a tremendous technical value or service. And so, we will have and to the question I got on synergies, we will have enough capacity with the two systems together to really optimize and make more of those higher-value products as the customers that we have need them. So we're excited about that and we will continue, like we do in a number of our other businesses, start with a product mix and a customer mix and work to improve that over time, with more of the higher value mix in the portfolio than when we started.","Operator","Adam Josephson from KeyBanc, your line is open.","Adam Josephson","Tim, just one on your containerboard inventories exiting the second quarter. How would you characterize -- Tim?","Timothy Nicholls","Yes, I'm here.","Adam Josephson","Sorry about that. Do you expect further reductions over the balance of the year or do you think you've sufficiently right-sized your inventories, if you will, to reflect the current freight and logistics situation?","Timothy Nicholls","I think we made a lot of progress. We were down in the quarter again and look, we try to run a lean supply chain to begin with, so we're managing it real-time, day to day, week to week. And we're making adjustments as we need to. As I mentioned earlier, we moved roughly 200,000 tons a week in board out to our system, so I think we came in lower in the second quarter. I think we have adjusted to supply chain. For the moment, we will have to see what happens. The thing about supply chain is, it doesn't stay static. If you talk to the rails -- the rail companies or their parking cars and trying to make adjustments and so, I think we're nimble enough that hopefully, we see those changes coming soon enough and we react ahead of time.","Adam Josephson","And Carol, just two quick one's for you, just on the EBIT bridge that you talked about. You've got the $60 million lower maintenance but you have the $35 million or so higher input costs and then $15 million or so of lower price mix In North America. Are those the big buckets that you would point us to, just to be clear?","Carol Roberts","Yes, Adam, I think those are the big movers and the big buckets. And I think the one for the second half that will be interesting to see how it plays out is going to be those input costs. Clearly, the outages are pretty clear and some of the commentary we gave around prices, things that we have the line of sight to. So we'll have to see how the input cost evolves over this second half of the year.","Adam Josephson","And just one last one on pension. So after the $500 million of contributions in the second half and given whatever you expect asset returns to be, what do you expect your pension gap to be at year end? And will these contributions that you're making have any impact on your share repurchases? Thanks very much.","Carol Roberts","So, on the pension, I think you can think about the contribution into the pension should definitely contribute toward closing the gap. The big unknowns will be really discount rates and interest rates and I've got to think they should only go up from where they were on June 30 and then asset returns, so it would be hard to speculate on those things but clearly, the $500 million should be helpful. And your second part of your question, Adam?","Adam Josephson","Carol, just given the pending acquisition of the fluff pulp business and given the pension contributions you're making, will that have any bearing on your stock repurchases, either this year or next year?","Carol Roberts","Yes, so, we remain committed to the buyback and as we all know, we have probably a little less than 1 billion left, that said, we've always said that if there were opportunities for reinvestment into the business to create value, that they -- those would be important priorities and with the size and scale of the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition, getting the funds to take care of that and addressing our debt profile will probably be our highest priority in the next year or so.","So then you could draw a conclusion about what does that mean for the buyback? I think it will depend very much on how things progress, the business conditions we see. I feel very good about our ability to continue to generate very strong free cash flow, so we will have to see how that manifests and unfolds over the next 12 to 24 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from DA Davidson.","Steve Chercover","So my first question is on free sheet, it doesn't appear that you had any impact from the price hike but I'm wondering if that is a function of mix and should we expect any benefit in the second half of the year?","Mike Amick","Price has been and will continue to move up, there is some impact, as you rightly stated. It centers around mix; it's also timing and so forth. But we do expect to see prices continue to go up.","Steve Chercover","And then secondly, it was kind of a weird press release from the FERC, indicating that you had regulatory approval for the Weyerhaeuser assets. So I'm, A, I don't even know if that was real, but if it is, is that a good precedent for the DOJ process?","Mark Sutton","That is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We have gotten that approval, but that is a different process than the DOJ process. It's one -- when we say we're under regulatory approvals, that is one of the regulatory approvals. Everybody focuses on the DOJ but there are more than just the Department of Justice.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Mark, I wondered, to start off, if we could talk a little bit about what you're doing on both sides of the business down in Brazil right now to improve performance?","Mark Sutton","So, Mark, I will start on the packaging side which is the business that's challenged because of the exposure to the Brazil economy. As I said the last couple of calls, what we're trying to do with that business is improve it from a cost profile standpoint and redesigning the way we're organize from a people standpoint and redesigning the way that we make and supply the containerboard to our box plants. And then, be as strong as we can and perform where we think we can perform in a positive economy versus a minus 4%. That business has the potential to perform much better at a plus 4% and being able to cover inflation with some degree of pricing versus a minus 4% market and being behind the inflation wheel.","So what we're trying to do is change the cost structure, make sure we continue to focus on the customers we have, even though everybody in almost every segment is hurting right now and be well-positioned when Brazil's economy begins to pick up. That is what we can control and we're being very careful with any investments and really trying to do, what I would say, is fundamental basic blocking and tackling on the commercial side And on the operational side. On the paper business, we continue to perform very well in that business. Part of it is because it fits squarely into being, if you're going to make uncoated free sheet and be a global provider. That is the place to make it and it starts with the fiber cost structure and our fiber availability.","So given our export position and given the fact that the paper market in Brazil hasn't been hit as much as some of the consumer product markets that hit the box business, we're continuing to perform well and it is part of the same story, is getting our cost even lower and making sure that we go the extra mile to take care of our customers, both in Brazil and outside of Brazil. And we still have some of the strongest EBITDA margins in all of IP in our Brazil paper business.","Mark Wilde","Just on those margins, Mark, one time when Champion had that, those margins would be in the 35% to 40% range. Is there any prospect of those returning, do you think?","Mark Sutton","I think if you take the recent past, we've been in the mid-30%s on several quarterly reports and if you look at the FX impact that has occurred over the last couple of quarters, if you just strip that out which you can't, but if you did, you would back into the low 30%s. It is a 30%-plus EBITDA margin business over time.","Mark Wilde","Okay, all right. And then I just had a follow-on for Tim Nicholls. Tim, you've taken a little over 600,000 tons of economic downtime in containerboard in the last four quarters. Should we think about IP going forward as just being willing to carry that much flex in the system?","Timothy Nicholls","I don't want to quantify and said there's going to be X number of tons but there is going to be some amount of system flex that we actually need. We're managing a system that is huge and just normal seasonality. The way we run our supply chain and the way we try to service customers and our businesses, we believe that we're better off flexing over time than trying to cover it with positioning inventory. You always get it wrong. So we will have some amount of downtime every year as we go through the year just balancing out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","Carol, just another question on the pension and then I hate to harp on it but the issue is if you look at the last three years, you've had to put $1.8 billion of cash into the pension which is -- looks like about a third of the free cash flow over the period. So I guess as we move into 2017 and then really based on the interest rates today, do you plan any more cash contributions over the next three years, let's say?","Carol Roberts","Yes, Scott and just a qualifier on what you said is, the contributions we made, while real, were essentially voluntary. Voluntary meaning as we look at our balance sheet, as we think about where to take the cash to manage our debt, we have looked at the economics around the pension and said that is not a bad place to go with some excess cash right now. Part of it's the tax advantage way of doing it. ","The other thing we always consider is we're always looking out and thinking about will we have a regret factor long term and we never want to have too much where we put money and then we say, why did we do that? So it's a balancing act based upon options. So I think what you're seeing us do is right now, this is what makes sense for us given the point we're relative to our overall debt profile. And there will be no required contributions out until 2019 and even 2019 is a very -- pretty, very small number, so that gives us choices and we will continue to make the choices around all those variables that we think meets our needs the best.","Scott Gaffner","Okay and is the comment on no cash contributions tile 2019 based on the year-end 2015 discount rates and expected rates of return or is it based on today's -- on the reevaluation that you were talking about?","Carol Roberts","Well, remember, there's two ways you have to look at your pension, there is one for accounting and that's your pension benefit obligation, that is the balance sheet. And then there is the funding. The funding is impacted by other factors, considering just the policy out of Washington. Remember we talked a couple of years ago about MAP and how that was the acronym for the smoothing of interest rates, so we have very good line of sight on the required contributions, based upon those things and they are smoothed out. So we know pretty certainly where that is. Now what we don't know is that accounting piece that hits at the end of the year which comes from discount rate -- remember 100 basis points for us is about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion Delta in that liability.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And then Mark, if I look at return on invested capital year to date, 10.6% which is in line with the first half of last year and for the full year 2015, you had the records, 11% return on invested capital, so is there anything in the second half and you hit those numbers despite some headwinds in the first half of the year. Is there anything in the second half that would preclude you from getting back to that 11% return on invested capital in 2016?","Mark Sutton","Well, I think the one new thing we have is the Weyerhaeuser acquisition which we think will close in the fourth quarter and that will have a temporary effect, as we bring that debt on and we will see it go back up. But what's important, Scott, is we think about the return on invested capital over a long period of time and we think about it in bands.","So the first band is get it to your cost of capital. We've demonstrated we can do that and then we look at two -- as I mentioned before, 200 or 300 basis points above our cost of capital and finding a way to settle in that band. And then the question is always, do you create more value by making your enterprise a larger enterprise at that return or do you create more value by raising that return even further? And, there is analytical approaches to that, that back up the solid business case, so the point number is a blood pressure check, but over time, we want to be in that zone where we have a couple of hundred or more basis points between our 8% cost of capital and our actual returns.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities.","Chris Manuel","I wanted to come back to some of the Weyerhaeuser assets in the fluff pulp, some of the different pieces there. Once you put this all together, can you talk about your ability to flex between making fluff pulp when you want to but some of the other grades, whether it's SBSK, et cetera. What you view -- I think we all know what long term demand looks like for fluff but perhaps maybe what some of the other end markets are? What you think long term demand looks like there and your ability to toggle back and forth?","Mark Sutton","Well, Chris, we obviously haven't been able to do any detailed integration work, but when you look at our system and we look at what we can publicly get available on the assets and the products that Weyerhaeuser makes and we will have, as I mentioned early, enough capacity to really optimize the production, but the real focus in this business for us is the higher value-added specialty fibers, starting with fluff and moving up.","The rest of the pulp is important and you will always have to make some of it as you make transitions and we have really good customers for that pulp, but the focus is really from fluff, basic fluff, all the way up to the high-value added specialty fibers. And we will have on day one, when these businesses come together because we have invested in the business recently and Weyerhaeuser has invested in the business, but we will have the capacity we need to make the products we want to make for the foreseeable future.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Royalty for final remarks.","Jay Royalty","Thanks, operator and thanks Mark and everyone for joining the call this morning. As always Michele and I will be available after the call and our numbers are on Slide 18 of the presentation.","Operator","Have a great day. This concludes today's conference.

Welcome to today's International Paper Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Day Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]","I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Thank you, Holly. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter 2019 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide two, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website.","Our website also contains copies of our third quarter 2019 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim JV and Graphic Packaging investment, slide two also provides context around those financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities.","I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark Sutton","Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We will begin our discussion on slide three. International Paper continues to deliver solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow. Our results again demonstrate the strength and resilience of our cash generation and the flexibility of our company to navigate well in a challenging environment.","Demand in the quarter was mixed. North America packaging improved seasonally, largely as we had expected. However, export containerboard and pulp shipments faced pressure from continued supply\/demand imbalance. Operational performance was strong. We took full advantage of our manufacturing and supply chain expertise and managed cost well in our three businesses.","Taking a look at our cash. Through the first three quarters, we generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow and returned nearly $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we also used $400 million for debt repayment.","Earlier this month, we increased our dividend for a 10th consecutive year, reinforcing our policy of a strong and sustainable payout of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, which is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and a brief update on our portfolio.","Yesterday we announced the completion of the sale of our controlling interest in the papers business in India. We are now passive investors with minority ownership of a company which we intend to fully exit. I want to thank our team in India for their dedication and wish them well in the future.","Continuing with our third quarter performance on slide four, we leverage the flexibility of our system, operated well and controlled costs to deliver $1 billion of EBITDA and margins of 18% in the third quarter. Revenue was down 6% year-over-year due to the impact of lower pricing in our packaging and pub businesses, especially in our export channels.","Our equity earnings were $27 million, which includes $18 million from our Ilim joint venture and about $10 million from Graphic Packaging. Ilim equity earnings were largely as expected and they reflect the impact of lower softwood pulp prices into China.","Free cash flow in the quarter was very strong at nearly $600 million. Through the third quarter, we have generated free cash flow per share of $4.43, compared to just under $4 per share for the full year in 2018.","Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our fourth quarter outlook. Tim?","Tim Nicholls","Great. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide five, which shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share bridge. Price\/mix was a headwind mostly due to the impact of prior index movements in North American packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers, as well as the flow-through of lower prices for export containerboard.","Volume improved modestly in the third quarter, driven by higher seasonal demand in North American packaging, as well as improved containerboard exports. This was partially offset by lower seasonal demand in our European packaging business.","Operations and cost performance was strong. We continue to optimize our mill and converting networks as we match our production to our customers' needs. We did experience $10 million of additional costs in the quarter related to Hurricane Dorian, mostly in our cellulose fibers business.","Maintenance outage costs were favorable, and input costs were better due to lower fiber costs across our businesses and geographies. Corporate expense and taxes were higher in the third quarter with an effective tax rate of 27% compared to 25% in the previous quarter. Most of this was related to adjustments to the federal tax provision after finalizing our 2018 tax return.","I'll now turn to the segments and start with Industrial Packaging on slide 6. Our business performed well and the North American business earned $525 million with margins of nearly 23%. Across the segment, price and mix was unfavorable, mostly on the impact of prior index movements in North America, and realization of lower export containerboard pricing. Volume was flat. Improved volume in North American packaging and containerboard exports was offset by seasonally slower demand in Europe as well as weaker demand in our packaging business in Turkey.","In North America, box demand improved seasonally. We had strong double-digit year-on-year growth in e-commerce and the protein segment continues to perform well. Process food improved modestly, but beverage, nondurables and durables remain weak.","In October, we've seen a slight pickup in demand. Overall, we're confident in our commercial outlook and the trajectory of our growth as we move into the coming year. The segments we serve, our customer portfolio and recent business wins add to our confidence.","Containerboard export shipments also improved in the third quarter, although a bit less than we expected. Underlying demand was actually pretty good, but customer inventories took longer to draw down.","Operational performance was strong. We leveraged the flexibility of our system and control costs effectively to mitigate the impact of economic downtime in the quarter as we adjusted production to meet our customers' needs. And finally, wood and recovered fiber costs were favorable versus the prior quarter.","I'd like to come back to containerboard exports for just a moment on slide 7 and give you a regional view on how we see things shaping up. Underlying demand has improved throughout the year generally as we expected, while inventories took about a quarter longer to normalize than we anticipated and have pressured shipments through the first three quarters.","Summarizing the regional dynamics. In Latin America, more favorable weather conditions are contributing to better crop harvest for bananas and other agricultural products that require kraftliner to go to market. In Europe, customer inventories took essentially three quarters to normalize while demand improved modestly.","Shifting to Asia. In China, demand remains sluggish as tariff uncertainties linger. And in other regions in Asia, demand is mixed, although customer inventories are back to normal levels. The takeaway here is that we expect export containerboard shipments to continue to recover, and we are seeing this in October.","Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on slide 8. Third quarter results were impacted by lower prices across all regions, which was partially offset by better mix on improved fluff pulp shipments. Volume improved by $4 million, also driven by improved fluff pulp shipments in the quarter. Supply\/demand conditions remain challenging. And although we see better customer demand, overall industry inventory levels remain high and trade and tariff uncertainties continue to weigh on China demand.","Against this backdrop, we continue to focus on optimizing our system and controlling costs. We ran well and successfully mitigated some of the impact of Hurricane Dorian in the quarter. Operations and cost also includes the impact of economic downtime as we adjusted production to meet our customers' demand. Input costs improved by $6 million.","Printing Papers on slide 9. Overall, the business performed well and delivered earnings of $162 million in the quarter. Across the segment, price and mix decreased mostly due to lower pricing for exports from our Latin American and European Papers businesses. Volume was essentially flat. The seasonal demand pickup in Latin America was a bit less than we anticipated, and lower volume in India fully offset increases in other regions.","In our North American business, we had strong performance in cut size as we continue to ramp up new customer business. However, performance in the roll business was weak due to challenging conditions in commercial printing.","In Latin America, supply and demand conditions are challenging as we enter the fourth quarter due to pressure from pressure from imports, especially from Asia. In North America, underlying demand is decreasing within our expected range of 3% to 4% annually, while the level of imports decreased in the quarter.","Operational performance was very strong. We ran well and controlled the cost across the system. In North America, we also benefited from a favorable LIFO inventory revaluation of about $10 million. And input cost improved on lower hardwood cost in North America.","On Slide 10, the Ilim joint venture delivered operating EBITDA of $113 million and an EBITDA margin of 24% before foreign currency charges. Earnings were impacted by lower export pulp prices as well as the completion of the highest maintenance outage quarter of the year, which also affected volume in the quarter.","Equity earnings were $18 million and were impacted by a non-cash foreign charge on Ilim's U.S. dollars denominated net debt, of which IP's portion was $4 million in the quarter.","So, let's turn to the outlook on Slide 11. I'll start with Industrial Packaging where we expect price and mix to lower earnings by $45 million on the impact of prior year index movement in North America and export price flow-through as well as the negative mix impact of export volume recovery.","Volume is expected to improve by expected to improve by $25 million on improved demand in North America and continued export containerboard recovery. Operations in costs are expected to lower earnings by $15 million due mostly to non-repeats of positive items in the third quarter.","Staying with Industrial Packaging, lower maintenance outage expense is expected to improve earnings by about $45 million and input costs are expected to remain stable.","In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to lower earnings by $30 million on the impact of prior index movement. Overall, volume is expected to be stable with higher fluff volume offset by lower market pulp.","Operations and costs are expected to be flat sequentially with the non-repeat of the hurricane impact being offset by higher seasonal energy cost and inputs are expected to remain stable.","Moving to Printing Papers, we expect price and mix to lower earnings by $25 million, mostly in our North American and Latin American businesses. Volume is expected to improve by $20 million on stronger seasonal demand in North America and Brazil.","Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $40 million related to the higher seasonal energy consumption across our papers portfolio as well as the non-repeat of LIFO benefits in the third quarter. And input costs are expected to improve by $10 million on lower fiber cost in North America and Brazil. Lastly, under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for the Ilim joint venture.","Slide 12 summarizes our full year outlook. As we continue to perform well in uneven global environment, our focus is on free cash flow generation and executing our framework for capital allocation.","For the full year, we expect EBITDA of $3.8 billion and we expect free cash flow to be $2 billion. On capital allocation, through the third quarter, we've returned about on $1.1 billion to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases and we've used another $400 million to strengthen our balance sheet.","And earlier this month, we also increased our dividend. Looking ahead, you can expect our capital as allocation choices to be consistent with our framework.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Sutton","Thanks Tim for covering the details on the quarter and for the outlook. As I always do at the end of our call, I'd like to just close with a few thoughts about the company and quarter.","Our solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow in the third quarter, I think, again, demonstrates that we built a really resilient company that can perform well in just about any environment. And while the U.S. economy remains healthy, we've been managing through some inventory headwinds and broader trade tension that are impacting our exports.","That said, our focus at International Paper is to execute well and maximize results in any environment. For us, that means being relentless about our pursuit of long-term value creation for our shareowners by focusing on free cash generation and executing our capital allocation strategy with that free cash flow.","And for our businesses, that means managing well what we can control, exceeding our customers expectations and strengthening our value proposition, making sure we optimize the full value chain and running our manufacturing network well and leveraging the strength and flexibility of our mill and converting systems. When we put all of this together, we perform well and generate very strong free cash flow.","Our free cash flow per share is up year-over-year. Our strong execution in the company's LIBOR allows us to raise our full year 2019 free cash flow year 2019 free cash flow outlook to $2 billion. We had unique capabilities to drive to just about any challenge we may face. Most importantly, we have the people, the innovation, the products and a low-cost high quality system to succeed with fantastic customers.","And with that, we are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Wilde, BMO Capital markets.","Mark Wilde","Thanks. Good morning Mark, good morning Tim.","Mark Sutton","Good morning.","Timothy Nicholls","Good morning.","Mark Wilde","Mark, just kind of staying on the free cash flow theme, I wondered, if you are in a position to give us any thoughts on the sort of CapEx as we move into kind of 2020 and kind of wrapped up with that. What do you think the proper kind of maintenance CapEx is for IP kind of across the cycle? I think you're about 70 to 80 of maintenance capital for this year?","Timothy Nicholls","Hey, Mark, its Tim. It's a good question. We are still -- we're getting close, but are still finalizing what 2020 is going to look like and we'll report that out when we release fourth quarter earnings. Question on maintenance capital, depending on the schedules, these are big pieces of equipment that have different time lines. So are always looking to make sure that we are being balanced by what an asset needs, but also recognizing that there is flexibility in timing. And we're always looking at how we can do it for less money in terms of outage schedules, how we use contractors, how we use our own labor. So it can go up and down, but there is some flexibility there that we can realize over time.","Mark Sutton","So I would just add to what Tim said, Mark. One of the objectives we shoot for on the whole maintenance subject and as we look at that is protecting today's cash flows and making them sustainable, there's the CapEx piece, but there's also the expense piece. And what we try to do is make sure we use our resources effectively, so we lower the total cost of maintenance. And it's all cash, and we try to lower the total cost. So if the CapEx solution can solve a recurring maintenance expense issue, it's probably the right thing to do to go ahead and eliminate that issue. So we really do look at it holistically.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then just to follow-on, Mark. You did call out an overhead reduction of about $20 million and I don't recall having heard about that initiative before. So perhaps you could give us a little color on that and what the trajectory might look going forward?","Timothy Nicholls","Yes, it's Tim again, Mark. I\u2019d just say its kind of normal practice. We had some charges last year due to restructuring. We're always looking at how we deploy across the organization for what we need to run the business and try to get better and do it at a lower cost with better processes. So there's initiatives underway. We don't promoted them. We don't talk about them broadly, but its just continues improvement and trying to make sure that we don't spend any money that we don't need to. So that's really the charge in the third quarter. And the charges in the third quarter, because we know where there is going to be impact, the savings from that charge will play out over a series of quarters as we implement.","Mark Wilde","Very good. I will turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly, Stephens Incorporated.","Mark Connelly","Your price cost performance in the containerboard was excellent again, despite all the down time. Is there any reason you would change the way you manage that downtime if we have to continue at the sort of levels? I'm just wondering if there's things that you do that work in the short run, but that you don't want to do longer term to keep those level of performance so high?","Mark Sutton","That's a great question, Mark. I think the way we try to look at it on the output of our system, especially containerboard given its so large, as we look at things that are structural versus cyclical, and obviously, if you that there are structural changes in the amount of containerboard, we needed to supply all of our box customers and open market customers, then you probably do some things differently.","But right now, we believe we built the system, through the last few years by integrating warehouse and integrated temporary then kind of normalizing our capability at the mills and taking a real focused view on marginal cost that we have lack of a better term, we have a throttle on the company","We can run wide open, we can run less than wide open, and we can shed certain types of costs and variabilize a lot of things that used to look fixed. So for us its whatever we believe about the near term and long term growth and the fundamentals in the industry and right now we see what's happening right now is mostly cyclical, not structural.","Mark Connelly","Okay. The performance there has really been excellent and the throttling effect is clearly massively different than what you've been able to do historically. My second question is a simple one. You are dealing pretty well with the challenges in the pulp market. Are you seeing any difference in the way customers are thinking about contract terms in terms of pass-throughs or anything else?","Mark Sutton","I think there\u2019s always some discussion on how the commercial arrangements are constructed. When you\u2019re in the moment of the excess pulp supply, sometimes customers do want to revisit the way contracts are structured. Usually the conversation goes to a normalized period and not just a cyclical high or low.","So there's always discussions on that, Mark. And I am able to say one thing. What we're seeing in the targeted markets we have, which is the absorbent products, it really is becoming very customer-specific and what type of economics, they're looking for based on their go-to-market strategy for that baby diapers and the other products.","And they\u2019re not all the same and years ago I use to see much more of a similar approach or desire by most customers. But we are seeing it segment into unique commercial types of conditions.","Mark Connelly","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Hey, Tim, hey, Mark, I thought I heard you mention during your prepared remarks that there were some recent win, I think you mentioned related to the containerboard business. If you could comment a bit more in detail, if there's something that we should keep in mind there and relatedly, I think you said your business is up modestly in October. But if you provide a bit more color about what you're seeing in the containerboard, especially domestically and then I had a follow on.","Tim Nicholls","Yes, George, it's Tim. It's actually speaking to our box business for were constantly working with customers about innovative solutions and how we address their needs and there is a cadence to these things. They don't neatly follow quarters, even multiple quarter sometimes, but we've been very active this year on -- with our commercial team, talking with customers in some cases, existing, and some cases new. And a number of wins that we've had for the box business that will start coming through over the next few quarters. So that was what I was relating to in the prepared comments. We feel really good about the teams win so far.","George Staphos","Okay. And just related point. How are you doing in July did you say \u2013 July and October?","Tim Nicholls","Well, July, I can tell you about that. October was a little bit better. We don't have a clear view on shipments. We have a clear view on what we're processing through our facilities, and so, when we close the month we\u2019ll see how much of that flow directly to customers versus preparing inventories for seasonal demand, especially around e-commerce. But yes, we saw a slight uptick in demand for October and feel good about it. We think it's going to be a good season for the fourth quarter.","George Staphos","Okay. And related question, I'll turn it over. The wins that you\u2019re seeing is there any kind of common denominator in terms of what IP is offering that might be somewhat different than what's being offered in the market? We tend not to hear so much from IP on how your narrowing systems and machinery with your corrugated business, is there any benefit that you\u2019re getting there? Can you just give us a bit more color in terms of why you're winning this business recognizing it doesn\u2019t always come in smoothly? And how sustainable that is going forward? Thank you, guys.","Tim Nicholls","Yes, thank you, George. We do because of our size and where we service customers, we do some of everything, and we do most of them in a very big way, so yes, machinery and yes, all types of innovative solutions. Innovative solutions are really important customer by customer for what they need, not for creating something that tried to go sell across the entire space.","Mark Sutton","I think just to add on that George, the approach we're taking with the large segment that tend to be the faster-growing segment like e-commerce, like protein, some of the things that IP has build over time, our scale and our reliability as a supplier and then bringing some innovation on top of that has allowed us to grow our position with customers that we already have a very large position with and we try to earn at that every single day, every interaction. And I would give a lot of credit, maybe it's not differentiated. I can\u2019t speak for other companies. I would give a lot of credit to the IP people that served these customers.","We have employees that are embedded with some of our customers, helping them solve the problems, helping them run package at faster rates. And I think that really works well for us, when we bring the full skills of IP to our customers. When I made my prepared remarks, I said something about leveraging and optimizing the entire value chain, and this is what we mean by doing that. It's not just the product, but it\u2019s how we provide the service and how we give even some of our Human Resources to our customer, our manufacturing team, for example, even go out and help customers in their manufacturing operation if it's applicable.","George Staphos","Very good. It\u2019s very solid quarter. Thank you, very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover, D.A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover","Thanks and good morning. I wanted to actually focus on the specialty cellulose business. So first of all, can you just remind us what you thought the mid-cycle earnings or EBITDA potential of the segment was post Weyerhaeuser?","Mark Sutton","So I think what we said on our few quarters ago that we believe that that business had a $600 million EBITDA potential, and we still believe that. We are in a period right now of some disturbances in the softwood pulp market and absorbent pulp is not immune to that. It affects both the pricing and also affects demand. So we believe that, that still an achievable objective. I'll remind you though, Steve, one of the things we stated as a strategy is to have our business at about 85% of our capacity focused on absorbent pulp. So fluff pulp in the specialty grades that are kind of a bubble for fluff pulp and the product continue. We're only about 74% right now. So are making some products, market pulp products and other products that they're not long-term products for us given the North American fiber and cost structure.","And the only place we really plan to make nonabsorbent pulp is in our mill in Canada, which makes a high-quality northern softwood. So we got a pretty clear strategic path. We've lost a little bit of time given this kind of softwood supply issue of time given this kind of softwood supply issue globally and the commercial things we talked about globally and the commercial things we talked about from last year. But we are very convinced that this is going to give International Paper the right growth profile. It's a great product line, the types of things that go into, and we believe he can get the business to that point. It's just going to take us all bit of time.","Steve Chercover","Okay. Thanks for the detail there. And I'm not trying to change dramatically -- it looks like we're going to start 2020 from a pretty low point. So I'm wondering are there anything -- any plan you have to do in place to improve results? And are you still being impacted by the commercial slow power or whatever you want to call it that impacted you earlier this year?","Mark Sutton","So the exit rate of 2019, you're right, will put us in a challenging position. And yes, we have commercial initiatives. The good news is we're commercial initiatives. The good news is we're commercial initiatives. The good news is we're beginning to see commercial wins in the targeted customers and grades we want to make and which is the absorbent products, and that will start to come to fruition as we go into 2020. And then there is a lot of opportunity on the cost structure. We have -- essentially we two 2 we have 2 businesses. We have the Weyerhaeuser business we acquired, which is doing very well. It was built for purpose pulp mills. And then we have the IT legacy part of that business, which is largely mills converted from other usage and not yet optimized. And there's still the ability to optimize several of those facilities and get out total cost down. So combination of commercial success, cost and then operating in this environment of supply and demand where pricing returns to more normalized level, all of that should come to fruition. The question is just, how long does it take on the market based stuff? The other things we control and we'll begin working on that as we go forward.","Steve Chercover","Thanks. Hopefully you'll count that as one pump question. I just wanted to ask about the Italian antitrust fine. Is this another situation where you chose to settle as opposed to litigate and are there other folks who were also impacted? Thanks. ","Tim Nicholls","No. It's Tim, Steve. We were acetifying, we're appealing that decision, and so we're recognizing the charge in the moment while we go through the build process.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Gabe, your line is open. I'm going to go to the next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Anthony Pettinari, Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. One of your competitors recently called out the capital investment to increase their OCC processing capacity. And I'm wondering for your North American system, are there opportunities to shift from virgin to recycled, given what looks like this potentially a structure lower OCC prize. And then maybe if you could just remind us what your system mix is between virgin and recycled?","Mark Sutton","Anthony, the system mix is roughly 35% recycled fiber. We have -- what we look at is the actual fiber cost through the system to where you actually form that sheet of paper. So we call that fiber to the head box because there's other cost involved. For example, you want to make sure your maximize your energy production in the integrated mills, even if you're blending and recycling fiber.","So if look at some of the investments we made over the last few years, we've increased our capacity at 100% recycled mills, and we've increased our capacity at some of our virgin mills that used certain amount of recycled fiber. So we have the ability to do more. But we look at more than just the cost of OCC. It really is the cost of the fiber to the forming part of the equipment that really matters because if you leave more OCC, and it causes you to generate less boiler fuel to make your biomass energy, you have not done anything on your cost. So that's how we look at it.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. No, it's very helpful. And then maybe a related question, pulp and paper recently introduced the recycle liner index. Do you anticipate any commercial impact from this index? And do you the index makes sense? I mean, it seems kraftliner has a pretty standard basis way. Recycled line seems lot that they used to may be quality differences, your thoughts on that?","Tim Nicholls","Yes. Anthony, it's Tim. Our belief is the box market is pretty competitive and the market's pretty efficient. And so knowledge -- there's not any new knowledge that's being created here. It's just being represented different way. So I can't speculate on what will happen. It's not hard to tell, see how it plays out. But in one sense, we don't see this as a significant change that's been put in the market.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mark Weintraub, Seaport Global.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. And I'm trying to tiptoe into what's a complicated question. So I realize it may be hard to really answer in this context. But you've mentioned your view on footprint that you look to see whether there are structural changes on the containerboard side to guide your actions, which makes perfect sense.","And I guess, one of the things that's been very now exposed, the fall off in demand has really been more weighted to the export business and domestic business. So if kind of focusing on the export business, how confident are you that, that bounces back?","And I guess, the two things -- the two variables that play, which maybe great to get your perspective on is, you have the slide where you showed China demand has been pretty weak, which given that they are importing so much less OCC has been somewhat fledgling even recognizing that maybe their economy slower. And then the second part being, you know, there is a reasonably large amount of capacity that's being started up outside of North America. How much of that is the issue for the export business versus what's obviously, again, in a weak macro situation overseas?","Mark Sutton","So you're right. That's a complex question or set of questions, Mark. But I think taking it up a level, the view that we have on containerboard is informed by the view we have on corrugated packaging growth globally. And the role that what we do export kraftliner plays in that, and we still see growth in boxes globally as a preferred method of packaging and we'll see were sustainability and all this discussion to go.","But we think it bodes well for fiber-based packaging, which then feeds into a kraftliner growth rate. We used to think it was 3.5%, its probably somewhere in that neighborhood. But for right now, we've seen a demand decline, and we saw inventories built last year. And when you put the two together we have a correction in the year of 2019.","We haven't seen any structural that changes the ultimate driver of the containerboard demand which is box demand. And the fact that kraftliner plays a very important technical role or reality role, which is it is the feedstock for the global recovered fiber market. So they really work together, and we still believe and see the future is very bright in corrugated packaging, which informs our view of our containerboard business.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And just \u2013 I did \u2013 did you give a specific indication on the EPS expectation for this year? I think I may have misheard but did you actually give a number there? Or did I miss here?","Tim Nicholls","We did not.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. I am sorry. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabe Hajde","Thanks for taking the questions. Sorry, about that gentlemen. My question was on the Riverdale conversion down in Selma, and I was trying to maybe see if you could frame up for us the impact to first half of next year. If I recall back the Riegelwood in 2016, I think it caught some of us by surprise the magnitude of differential between taking the mill down and doing the work and then when it ramps back up. I don't know if there's any context you can give us around that.","Tim Nicholls","No. It will be a pretty long outage. There's a lot of work to be done, when we take it down and start making the conversion. I think it's premature to lay that out at this point. We are finalizing what that all looks like next year. I'm sure we'll be able to give some general indications as we report on fourth quarter. But at some point papers will -- the production of Printing Papers will shut down on the machine and then all of the preparations for -- we tried to do as much work on ancillary equipment ahead of time. So that work is done, construction work, but then on the machine itself and related parts of the back-end of the mill, that work will begin early in the first quarter as we've outlined, and so we can give you more insight on that as we report fourth quarter.","Gabe Hajde","Okay. Thank you, Tim. And one more, I guess, focusing on the conversion. I've read some pieces different places that the capacity conversion may be more net neutral to capacity, which seemingly imply a shuttering somewhere else. And I was curious \u2013 you guys have taken a pretty decent amount of economic downtime this year, how you're thinking about your network and your needs as you see, commercial winds and the corrugated downstream business and what you might need elsewhere in the organization?","Tim Nicholls","Yes. So, Gabe, you may be thinking about is how it relates to white-top liner, but not the system overall. So we run our system based on our customers' needs. So that's where we start from. But this will be incremental available productive capacity. What it's actually going to free up is other facilities that they're currently producing this product to produce other products. One of which has a large position in gypsum facing board and will now be able to grow that position. So, it won't all show up in containerboard necessarily, but gypsum facing board or gypsum facing paper is something that we've been in that market for a long time. We have great customers. We think we provide good products and good service and we really would like to grow that position over time.","Gabe Hajde","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Adam Josephson, KeyBanc Capital.","Adam Josephson","Mark and Tim good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it.","Mark Sutton","Hi, Adam.","Adam Josephson","Mark, just one on your box demand on the quarter is \u2013 call it flat in the quarter. If memory serves, on the last call you talked about your thought that your customers had little down their finished goods inventories quite considerably, and I think you expected somewhat of a pick up in the second half as a result of that. So, did you see that? I'm just trying to square that with the flattish demand and relatedly you talked about e-commerce continuing to grow at double-digit and I'm also trying to square that with flattish demand in the quarter?","Tim Nicholls","Yeah. So, Adam, we did not see, to your point, we didn't see to the extent that we thought we would. We did see it in e-commerce. We feel really good about e-commerce. On protein side, we saw good performance. Process food, as I mentioned, was slightly better but not as much as a pick up as we thought it would be. And then some of the other segments, other non-durables, beverage and the like, did not come through the way we expected it to. But we also had in terms of some of these consolidation plays that have happened across the industry, we've had some business lost due to those that happened at the moment in time and then the replacement volume for that comes through on a longer time line, but that's what I was referring to with these customer wins. We feel good about the commercial activity in the quarter that will show up in the coming quarters.","Adam Josephson","I appreciate that, Tim. And then just one also on e-commerce, I'm just trying to connect the e-commerce growth with total market growth. So back in 2016 and 2017, obviously, everyone was talking about e-commerce. It was growing double-digit. Box demand was up 2% but it happened to coincide with the economy really, taking up. And now you're still talking about e-commerce growing at double-digit, but you're demand is flat. So I'm just trying to \u2013 what do you think the relationship is between your e-commerce growth for the market e-commerce growth in total, box demand growth given the relationship this year seems to have delinked, if you will?","Tim Nicholls","Yeah, I think it's appearing to be delinked only because we've had some of these losses that I talked about that kind of creates noise in the number. I think you're going to see that reverse itself over the next couple of three quarters. So I don't think anything structurally has changed.","Mark Sutton","I think, Adam, we talked about the box demand kind of trailing GDP by 50, 70 basis points, somewhere in that neighborhood, total box demand. You got a couple of sub-segments like e-commerce that are growing very, very fast, but we've got pluses and minuses in some of the other segments, some of these trade wars and that crimp some of the exporters from the U.S. There's always something going on. But think about the third quarter. GDP 1.9, box demand, 1 5 and so it's possible that e-commerce can be growing double-digit, which it is, and box demand can be a shade below GDP. So I think the GDP number and what drive the U.S. economy, the components of it, are really what we need to look at in terms of trying to understand box demand. And there's obviously some periods where there's three quarters in a row where it attracts perfectly, and then there is some noise in the system. You think about when this noise started, it started to really show up around the time, we started talking about tariffs and trade, and a number of those things. So, I do think this notion of it being right below GDP is still pretty solid.","Adam Josephson","Thanks so much, Mark.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon","Hi. Good morning and thanks for all the details. I wanted to just pick-up on the whole e-commerce piece again. Could you give us an idea of what proportion today it makes up of your overall domestic U.S. box demand? And it sounds to me, if it's up double-digit, that at least seems to be that it has either at versus flattening with what you've seen in recent years or maybe achieved and accelerated a little bit from what was at least earlier this year when Seok [ph] and other concern seems to suggest that may be the demand growth would slow from e-commerce.","Mark Sutton","Chip, it's in the neighborhood between 5% and 10% of our demand. And you're right, things like Seok until you actually implement those. There's lot of different opinions on how it works. But again, back to the fundamental role, corrugated can play in the supply chain, most of those initiatives we see as if we do our job right and innovate, we see those as more net positives for corrugated box demand than negatives.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And would you say there's been any real change in growth rate as you look at where we are now versus the last couple of years from e-commerce?","Mark Sutton","No. Not really, it's still holding up solid double-digit.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And then just two quick ones, as a follow-up. You had caution with the whole China export board side from China, that would seem to be the one that had the most yellow, I would say, on the chart. Is that more from a knowledge that you think it's going to stay weak for an indefinite period or just the fact that the information from China just seems to be so murky, you just can't tell?","And then other question is, can you just update us on long-term timing of some of the projects, we've heard about at Ilim in the next several years?","Tim Nicholls","Yeah. So the view that we shared in the prepared remarks up on demand and inventory in the region, that's our current view. It comes from a lot of sources. Yeah, there are some reported numbers in places, it's what we see on the ground is we interact with customers for the most part.","Chip Dillon","Okay.","Tim Nicholls","And then on Ilim, the project around containerboard has been approved. It will start going forward. But that's a couple of 2.5 years, three years before anything starts slowing to market.","Chip Dillon","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Debbie Jones, Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones ","Hi. Good morning.","Mark Sutton","Good morning, Debbie.","Debbie Jones ","I wanted to ask about the volume guidance, sequential volume guidance of up $25 million in Industrial Packaging. You typically in the past, we've seen the seasonal move being down at least in the North American business. So I wanted to understand what your assumptions are for domestic box shipments and containerboard going into that? And is this being fully offset, any sequential weakness being offset by expert, is that way to think about it? Or have we reached a point where e-commerce benefited actually making 4Q less having seasonal impact?","Tim Nicholls","Yeah. I think on the box side, we're anticipating a strong season. We'll see how it plays out. We expect e-commerce to be in a solid place. We are also starting to see export volume and export demand pick up, and so that is going to impact our fourth quarter in a positive way for volume that we did not have in the second and third quarter.","Mark Sutton","I think, Debbie, on the e-commerce question, I think if you look back at the data over the last few years, the past peak in the third quarter dropped off in the fourth quarter has been evening out, because e-commerce would their value proposition have shortened shipping times and people are still active in the fourth quarter.","And then it even, to some extent, spilled into the first quarter with the whole return cycle. So there's just been an evening out of the demand, less of the peak, less of the drop off. And that started if you remember right, probably in 2016 and then 2017 it become more even and we continue to see that.","Tim Nicholls","The other thing that may be in your memory, Debbie is just the difference in days, especially last year from third to fourth. We had two less days in the fourth quarter last year versus the third, and we've got one less day this year. So it's a little bit better in than regard.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And my second question is focusing on paper. Could you talk a little bit more about the seasonal uptick in LatAm paper that didn't really materialize as you're expecting in the quarter. And I wanted to understand a bit better the improvement in operations and cost sequentially, you mentioned the LIFO benefit, and I didn\u2019t have any of that my model, just weren\u2019t understand where most of that came from?","Tim Nicholls","Easy on the LIFO, we had a better fit in the third quarter that we don't expect to repeat in the fourth, and so that was what that comes it is about. On the seasonal demand, that didn't pick up. There were some delays in government buying programs around certain segments of Printing Papers in Brazil that came through, but came through late. And the export business, especially around other parts of Latin America where we ship just been pressured from imports and people have plenty of inventory so it's working off inventory position.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn over.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Hey, good morning Mark and Tim.","Mark Sutton","Hey, Tim.","Brian Maguire","Just wanted to come back to the really strong cost management in the quarter, a lot of moving pieces there, but on slide 30, you talked about some of the input cost trends there. It looks like fiber was a pretty meaningful one.","I guess, I'm just trying to square the significant benefit you got from wood fiber, on that lets say the ballpark in $20 million with the average cost over to the right being up 1%, that you're paying.","Just trying to figure out how that could have been. And maybe a little bit really to answer these questions earlier, just theorizing maybe you shifted a little bit more of the production over to recycled base from virgin. Is that part of it? Or other factors in there?","Tim Nicholls","Yeah. It's Tim. So we've been battling wood cost all year long. If you remember, tremendous amount of rain and wet weather starting late fourth quarter last year and continuing into well into the first quarter this year.","So, it's just a matter of being able to access and have availability. And then buy intelligently as we can to maintain the kind of inventory levels, that the mills that we need for wood fiber.","It's starting to normalize. We're probably be pretty close to a more normalized cost, as we exit the year, but the wood piece has been a challenge all year long, of course.","Brian Maguire","Okay. So the average cost up 1% or were they actually down versus 2Q, just trying to square that.","Tim Nicholls","Slightly down. We've been managing it down all year long. So, we were really high as we exited last year. And it's been hardwood and softwood. Hardwood has been the one that's been a little bit harder to bring down. Softwood, we've had a greater degree of success faster so.","Brian Maguire","Okay, great. And then adjust for my follow-up. Some of the new box business you called out that will kick in, in a couple of quarters.","Just wonder if you could comment on the mixed impact of that, might have on pricing or margins, just how would you describe your business versus the current portfolio and the legacy portfolio?","Tim Nicholls","Could you restate the question? I'm sorry we didn't hear the first part.","Brian Maguire","Yeah. I was just asking about some of the new box business that you called out, taking into the next couple of quarters. Just interested to hear what the mix impact of that would be on the pricing on margin. How would you kind of compare that to maybe just same portfolio of customers?","Tim Nicholls","Yeah. I think it's probably pretty flat. We're out there winning business on the capability. What we do for our customers? How we service them? The innovation we bring and the quality. So, it's a pretty mix neutral type of equation.","Brian Maguire","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","And our final question today will come from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde, BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Thanks. Tim, I've got a couple of box questions to kind of finish up on. One is we have the Chicago PMI up this morning, which was now more than five points just month-to-month.","Can you help us think about, how you think about the relationship between indicators like that and your box business? And then, I got one other question on boxes?","Tim Nicholls","Sure. Yeah. I mean, this is definitely related. I didn't see the numbers; I haven't called out to it yet. Whether it in the moment or there are some time lag. It's sort of manufacturing activity is what drives box demand. So there's got to be relationship there. I don't know if that's a moment in time and then reversion.","But, as I said, our volume, we saw pickup in October and we're still anticipating a pretty strong fourth quarter. So, we'll see how it plays out.","Mark Sutton","I think important thing, Mark, on things like purchasing managers index and those things is give it enough time. I mean, we've got a lot of disruption in the supply chain from manufacturing in the U.S., a lot of it related simply to the GM auto strike. And as you've got to let the data to play out but it is an input to many -- to our on demand model.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And the other one I wondered about is just how you think about the impact of new converting capacity, because it seems like there is a lot of new converting capacity coming into the market. Just to name a few, you've got the D Smith and box-propalable building these mega plants in Indiana. France, building -- bringing a lot of capacity into the market. And then you've got some domestic public and private competitors that are also adding kind of a box capacity. So what kind of effect are you seeing in the market from all of this? And how do you think about how it plays out, especially in flat demand or flattish demand?","Mark Sutton","I think the issue with converting is one of the tenants that needs to be, because of the nature of the product, on empty boxes what you're making. It needs to be close to the demand centers. And so what you see sometimes is in our case, we add to learning capacity where we have customers and the desire for it.","We may actually have that capacity, but it could be clear across the country and will just not use that capacity and take a shipped out or to do whatever we have to do and then use the capacity close to the customer.","So, I can't speak for all these companies that are building or adding. But that's how we think about it is. Converting capacity is that last step in value add and transformation of containerboard into something people actually buy. And for us, it's about capabilities near where our customers and our growth is.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Good luck in the fourth quarter and as we move into next year.","Mark Sutton","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the call over to Guillermo Gutierrez for closing comments.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Thank you again for joining International Paper's Third Quarter Earnings Call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up question. Thank you.","Mr. Guillermo Gutierrez, you may begin.","Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.","Thank you, Sarah. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter 2018 conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website.","Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2018 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, slide 2 also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities.","I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on slide 3. International Paper delivered a very strong second quarter performance and year-over-year earnings growth. We had outstanding commercial performance with volume growth and accelerating price realization across our three businesses. Operationally, we performed well in another heavy maintenance outage quarter, and we have now completed 75% of our planned maintenance outages in 2018.","Input costs and transportation remain a headwind, which we view largely as a reflection of the healthy underlying global demand environment. The only notable exception is recovered fiber costs, which decreased sequentially and continues to be affected by China policy changes. Overall, we continue to see healthy demand and good fundamentals across our global businesses.","Turning to the financial results on slide 4. Revenue increased by more than 8% year-over-year, which again reflects healthy underlying demand, strong commercial performance and a focus on profitable growth. Our North America Industrial Packaging business outperformed industry shipments through the first two quarters of 2018. It's a reflection of really great customers in growing segments. In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, we delivered record fluff pulp shipments during the quarter.","EBITDA improved by 23% year-over-year, driven by margin expansion across all of our businesses, as well as a continued focus on commercial and operational excellence. Many of those initiatives are internal initiatives unique to International Paper.","Our equity earnings were $70 million in the quarter, which includes $57 million from our Ilim joint venture and $15 million from our ownership interest in Graphic Packaging. We also received a $6 million cash dividend from Graphic Packaging during the second quarter.","Our cash from operations in the second quarter improved by about $160 million year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our earnings. Free cash flow for the quarter is essentially flat, and that's just due to the timing of CapEx spending in 2018. Also during the quarter, we purchased $300 million of IP shares.","Tim will provide additional details on those purchases as well as our broader capital allocation framework later on the call. I'm excited to be working with Tim in his role as CFO. Many of you know him from his previous roles most recently leading our North American Industrial Packaging business.","I'm now going to turn the call over to Tim to cover the performance across our businesses as well as our third quarter outlook. Tim?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Great. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm very happy to be back in the role and able to share our second quarter performance with you.","So let me begin on slide 5 of the presentation, which is our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share bridge. Operating earnings improved $0.25 sequentially, driven by strong commercial performance and price realization across all businesses. Our operations performed well in what was another heavy outage quarter and, as Mark mentioned, we've now completed 75% of our planned maintenance outages in 2018.","Input costs were favorable, mostly due to lower recovered fiber prices in the second quarter. Distribution costs continue to trend higher on a very tight truck and rail availability as well as higher diesel fuel costs. We expect the distribution environment to be an ongoing challenge and continue to work aggressively to mitigate its impact.","Our corporate expenses and taxes came in largely as expected with a 25% effective tax rate in the quarter. And lastly, equity earnings were lower sequentially due to the non-FX charge on Ilim's U.S.-dollar-denominated net debt, which works out to be about $0.09 deduction to our EPS. All in, a very strong performance across the company.","So, on page 6, I'll turn to Industrial Packaging. Industrial Packaging, the team turned in very strong performance in the quarter and delivered quarter EBIT of $569 million with an EBITDA margin of 23% in North America. We continue to see good demand across all channels and realized about 50% of our recent box price increase as we exited the second quarter.","We've also completed approximately 75% of planned maintenance outages in the first half of the year. Operations and costs in the second quarter includes higher LIFO inventory revaluation charges related to the recent price increases. And on input costs, we saw the favorable impact of lower energy and recovered fiber costs, which was partially offset by higher distribution costs across the system.","In our European Packaging business, we continue to see compressed margins on our non-integrated business. But having said that, the Madrid mill start-up is in process and we expect to have paper on rail in the coming days. Once up and running, it will materially improve our margins, improve our cost position and our product range. Again, we're very pleased with the business fundamentals and our strong performance in the North American Industrial Packaging business.","Turning to Global Cellulose Fiber on slide 7, delivered $69 million of earnings in the second quarter. The two big drivers were the acceleration of price realization and lower planned maintenance outages. On the last point, you may recall that we moved some outages to help meet strong customer demand in the quarter.","Global pulp demand is healthy and demand in the fluff segment continues to grow at 4% to 5% annually. During the second quarter, we delivered record fluff pulp shipments, which represent about 75% of our pulp mix. Overall, we're pleased with the progress that the business is making on the commercial side, and the optimization initiatives that they're bringing to the bottom line.","Moving to Printing Papers on page 8, we continue to see improved demand globally, and North American mill operating rates have improved significantly since last year. As such, we're realizing price increases across all the regions that we operate in.","Volume improved sequentially despite the truckers' strike in Brazil and the lingering effects of the incident at the Kwidzyn mill which returned to normal operations earlier this month. The impact of the truckers' strike of $7 million was offset by favorable FX.","Operationally, we did perform well and we've now completed 85% of planned maintenance outages for the year. And although input costs were essentially flat, distribution costs remained elevated, particularly in North America. We're pleased with the improved earnings and the runway in our paper business.","As you can see on slide 9, all three businesses continue to show strong year-over-year profitable growth. At a high level, you can see that we came out of a weaker 2016 with consistent revenue growth quarter-over-quarter. In our North American box business, we're ahead of industry volume growth through the first half of this year on what is certainly a tough industry comp.","In our business, we are well-positioned in segments that are benefiting from strong secular growth trends. We are also progressing well on our recent box price increase that was announced earlier this year, with 50% realization at the end of the second quarter. And looking forward to the third quarter and year-end, we should be at a 90% realization as we exit the third quarter with full realization by year-end.","As I mentioned earlier, the pace of price realization in our Global Cellulose Fibers business accelerated in the second quarter. We're also making good progress with new product introductions in our fluff pulp segment, which is one of the reasons we have expanded fluff pulp to about 75% of overall pulp mix. In papers, we are seeing improved demand and have value propositions in global brands to capture profitable growth.","Turning to slide 10, the Ilim joint venture delivered record operating EBITDA of $307 million in the second quarter and an EBITDA margin of 44% before foreign currency charges. IP's equity earnings were $57 million and were impacted by a non-cash foreign exchange charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt, of which IP's after-tax portion was $39 million.","Taking a look at our third quarter outlook on slide 11. In the Industrial Packaging business, we expect to see a $50 million benefit from continued realization of our recent price increases, mostly in North America. Mix is expected to be a $10 million headwind mainly due to geographic mix. Also note that North American has one less shipping day in the third quarter.","We also expect $5 million of incremental expenses related to the Madrid mill start-up during the quarter. The mill is in the start-up process as we speak and we expect to ramp up to 1,000 metric tons per day by the end of the year and to run at full capacity of 400,000 metric tons within one year from start-up.","Staying with Industrial Packaging, outage expenses will be $55 million lower, while input costs are expected to increase by about $25 million. In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, we expect to see a $15 million benefit from our recent price increases and improved mix. Volume is expected to increase seasonally with a benefit of $10 million, as we continue to run our system full to meet customer demand, and outage expense will be $14 million lower.","In our global Printing Papers business, we expect to see a $20 million benefit from our recent price increases and mix. Volume is expected to improve sequentially on stronger seasonal demand in Brazil with an expected benefit of $10 million. Also within Printing Papers, operations are expected to improve $15 million, partly offset by higher input costs of $10 million, mostly related to wood in Brazil, Europe and Russia, and outage expenses will be $43 million lower.","Under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture and investment in Graphic Packaging. And lastly, in Other items, we include corporate and interest expense and our estimated effective tax rate for the third quarter.","Looking at slide 12, I want to take a moment to share with you our capital allocation framework and more specifics on how we will maximize value creation with our strong and sustainable cash from operations. We will maintain a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, which we view as foundational to the strength of International Paper and provides us with the financial flexibility to maximize value creation. Specifically, we will target debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times to 2.8 times on a Moody's basis.","With regard to our pension plan, we feel very good about where we are today with no funding requirements on the horizon. Going forward, we will continue to assess if there are attractive opportunities to further de-risk the plan on a structural basis.","We will invest to create value. Our investments will be selective and disciplined, and they will be grounded on clear strategic and financial logic. We will start with a commitment to maintain our safe and sustainable world-class operations with low-cost advantaged assets.","We will also invest in cost reduction projects with high returns and quick paybacks, and in strategic projects, with a meaningful spread above cost of capital in our core businesses, Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers, all of which further enables us to grow our free cash flow.","M&A will be disciplined, selective, and compelling. It must align with our strategy of advantaged positions and attractive markets, and create compelling value for our shareholders with clear financial targets. EPS and free cash flow accretion within the first two years and returns above cost of capital within the first three years.","We will return cash to our shareholders through a sustainable dividend and systematic share repurchases. Our dividend policy is clear. We're committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, which we will review annually as earnings and cash flow grow.","We will also make share repurchases with a minimum threshold to offset dilution from our compensation plans. And we will continue to evaluate our free cash flow and intrinsic value to ensure that additional share repurchase opportunities are weighed against other capital allocation options with a commitment to maximize value creation.","As Mark alluded at the opening, we did repurchase $300 million of shares at an average price of $57.32, and we have $600 million remaining on the current authorization.","With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Tim. We're very pleased with our strong performance in the quarter. It's our best second quarter in more than a decade. But more importantly, we're pleased with the momentum we carry going into the second half of the year.","We continue to see profitable growth across our three businesses with a healthy demand backdrop and high mill operating rates. We're monitoring the tariff situation carefully and, although we do not see any near-term impact to our business, it's certainly difficult to predict the timing and potential impact of evolving trade policies, but we're watching it very closely and are involved in the public policy debate.","Our team is focused on delivering on our earnings commitments, and that starts with commercial and operational excellence. We believe taking care of our customers and running safe, efficient operations creates sustainable value.","We also have internal catalysts to further accelerate our performance, such as the Madrid mill, which fundamentally changes our business model in Europe, as we move from practically 0% integration to about 60% integration on recycled containerboard. And in Global Cellulose Fibers, the team continues to optimize the business and is bringing innovative solutions to our customers as we grow together in the absorbent pulp market.","Looking ahead, we are confident in our commitment to deliver a second consecutive year of more than 15% EBITDA growth.","With that, we'll open up the call for questions.","Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.","Sarah, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the color on the capital reallocation strategy. Just wanted to ask Tim if you marked for the pension to kind of current rates. How close to that targeted 2.5 to 2.8 times range you think we are today? And sort of related to that, for the right acquisition, how high do you think you'd be willing to go with that leverage level?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. So, currently, we are roughly a little bit below 3 times. So I don't think we're far off. But I don't want to talk about what we might do and when. But the target is to be consistently in a 2 5 to 2.8 times leverage multiple, and it'll be a combination of debt that we pay down and earnings performance.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","And, Brian, I could just add on the question about how high. I mean, fundamentally, we will remain an investment-grade company. And so there's a lot of that goes into that statement, but one of the things is managing even in an event of any acquisition; number one, how high; and number two, how fast you get it back to the level that we're targeting. And that's just in our mind not negotiable. We think it's important, as Tim said, the word foundational is what it is for International Paper.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And on the share repo in the quarter, obviously $300 million is the most it's been in a while. Just wondering, philosophically, was that just more of an opportunistic thing in the quarter or, obviously, you want to offset dilution from equity issuance through the year. This seems like it'll pretty much do it. But is the messaging and the communication here that this is going to be more of a consistent ongoing thing, or should we take it as this was kind of it for the year and more of an opportunistic thing too?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Well, I wouldn't forecast what we might or might not do in the year. The commitment is that we're going to be systematic about share repurchases and, at a minimum, we will repurchase shares on an annual basis to offset the dilution from our compensation plans.","So we thought we had an opportunity in the second quarter, we bought some shares. As I laid out, all of these things are related and there's a number of actions that we could take around capital allocation whether it's balance sheet, share repurchases, dividend, is something that we look at annually. So I see them as all related, and we'll be reporting back as we do them after the fact.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. One last one for me, just switching to the base business. With the elevation in U.S. freight rates, it's been pretty well publicized. Just wondering, do exports look more attractive to you these days? Has your kind of thoughts on where you want to be putting your tons between the domestic and the export market changed much because of that? And maybe you can kind of just update us on where that mix stands today.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. It really varies by business. So, if you look at Global Cellulose Fiber, it's mostly an export business. Our markets are in other regions of the world as well as North America. For the containerboard business, we look at it as a strategic part of our mix. We obviously value our integrated box channel. And so we make sure that we are managing the customer demand here in North America and as well as balancing that out with exports.","But your question around just margin structure of one region versus another, we still see good margin structure here in North America even on a marginal basis with the transportation costs as they are.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Gail?","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","(22:05) year-on-year on adjusted basis. And then it's a bit slower than we've seen. I'm just wondering is there anything you're seeing in the business. Are there any end markets that you stand out?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hey, Gail. Hi, this is Mark. We didn't hear the first part of your question, if you could repeat it.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Just industry box shipments in 2Q were (22:27) which is somewhat slower than what we've seen. And I'm just wondering, are you seeing any end-markets that are slowing down or changing, or just is there any shift on the demand front?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Cut out just a little bit again, Gail, but I think I got the essence of the question. We felt really good about our box demand in the second quarter and it was against I think the toughest comp of the year year-over-year. So, protein produce, e-commerce, those segments continue to perform very well for us and we were really happy with growth both on a large customer level and our local business across the entire quarter.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. And during the quarter, Ilim announced that they were looking at a large kraftliner expansion in Russia. You guys are working on a large expansion here. There are other producers that are looking at kraftliner on a level that we haven't seen in probably at least three decades. And I'm just wondering how you see that playing out globally. Do you think the fiber balance is there that we need that much more kraftliner these days?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","A great question, Gail. Specific to International Paper's efforts, on the Ilim side, the way projects work in that part of the world, you've obviously got to announce that you're going to study and look at something so you can get the different government agencies involved. Forestry is managed differently there.","Infrastructure in this particular case is in Siberia, and we believe that's an opportunity much like our pulp business to serve an underserved market from a fiber standpoint, that'd be in Asia. But it's just that. It's undertaking a project and a lot of things have to happen for that project to come to fruition.","I think that's probably true from some of the other ones I also saw that are not International Paper. And then you take that all the way to something that's certain and sure like our Riverdale conversion. Our view is kraftliner is growing globally because the box market is growing globally. It is the feedstock for all of the fiber uses downstream.","And so it's hard to predict what the markets will look like three, four, five, six years from now. But International Paper has first and second quartile high-quality kraftliner. We have the position in the markets that need it and want it and value it. So, for us, it makes sense to continue to be looking at investing in that market over time.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim. Morning, Guillermo.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Morning.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Morning.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Mark, I wondered if we could just step back and talk a little bit about the kind of the pricing model in Industrial Packaging. In the past, John Faraci, your predecessor, talked about a willingness to maybe rethink that model at a particular point in time. And I just wondered right now, with the market in pretty healthy condition, whether this is a time you might engage customers to kind of rethink this basis on kind of trade paper pricing.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Mark, I'm going to let Tim comment, given his closeness to that particular market in Industrial Packaging. But pricing, as you know, is at the box level very unique to the type of customer and the type of packaging. There's a catalyst in this industry in North America for the input material changing and contracts are designed around that.","There's lots of different ways to do it. Customers buy a lot of other inputs that are priced different ways. But, for right now and for the foreseeable future, this mechanism while imperfect, works for the parties in the value chain. And so, that's kind of how we look at it. But the pricing discussion is really a conversation between International Paper and individual customers, to some extent precipitated by some input cost changes.","And, Tim, do you want to add to that?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Well, no, I think you said it well. The only thing that I would add to it is the way \u2013 it's inappropriate to first talk about what model we might move to. But in the various contracts, it doesn't establish price. It establishes the basis for us to have a conversation about how the contract will perform and how price may move or not move over time.","So I don't know that I can add much more than what Mark said. It works at the moment. Our customers find value in it and it's been around for a long time. And so what we negotiate on actual price is our conversation to our customers and agreeing on the basis of supply.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Fair enough. But as a follow-on, I just wondered, Tim, can you or Mark talk about the options for fixing that Brazilian packaging business and maybe whether you're interested in expanding packaging kind of across Latin America more broadly? You're in the two biggest markets right now, Mexico and Brazil.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. It's been a challenge, Mark. No question about it. And I think that we like our box plant assets there. We're challenged on the mill cost side, but we have a great customer base. We got pulled in the downdraft of the economy, and that hit us harder than we ever expected it would. And we're battling our way back from that.","But, yeah, we're happy with the engagement of the team and the things that they're working on. But it is taking more time and it's harder than we thought given some of the economic realities on the ground.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I mean, does that mean you need like to have virgin fiber mill assets there or what does fix this, Tim?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","I think we have the ability to continue ramping up our commercial execution. There's huge leverage there in terms of marginal volume that we put through our box plants. And that will go a long way to restoring margins. There are some cost opportunities, but I think we want to be very careful and very selective about how we think about incremental investments there.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I was going to ask a different question to start, but just given the way the stocks in the history have been acting recently. Tim, I know it's ultimately investors' and analysts' jobs to consider valuation, but has the fact that the market's been effectively applying a higher cost of capital on your results, with the stock having come down, change at all the way you think International Paper will think about capital allocation going forward and the returns that you'll require from new investments? Has there been any migration in those views over the last couple of quarters, and why or why not?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Hi, George. Yeah. I think it's what I was trying to outline earlier. We're going to be selective. We're going to be disciplined and we're going to invest in things that support improvement in our core businesses. So I would say, no, there has been no change in our thinking, other than to say we are trying to make better and better choices about investment decisions over time.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I guess a related point and then I'll ask one more as my two-part and turn it over. With again the return that's being applied or discount rate applied to your equity value by the market these days and how it's changed apparently over the last few quarters, does that make buyback any more attractive?","You're using a more systematic approach. You've talked about taking in the dilution. But does \u2013 equity has it moved up in terms of repurchases, in terms of capital allocation over the last six months and again given the way it's performed, why or why not? That's question one.","And question two, just as we think about the heat map table or slide 11, are there any other points that we should consider in terms of sequential EBITDA trends, are we basically looking at or whatever the number works out, so I think about $130 million, $150 million sequential pickup in EBITDA 2Q to 3Q? Thank you, guys. Good luck in the quarter.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. I'd just say, and Mark maybe want to comment on it, but I think the businesses are performing very well and we're set up for a strong third quarter and second half.","And related to the first question, I don't want to start forecasting what we're going to do at moments in time. I think we're going to take a broad view. We're going to look at our cash availability and then we'll make the best decisions across the whole capital allocation framework that I talked about.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for the thoughts.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Tim, you discussed the leverage target at 2.5 to 2.8 times, and I think that's down, or at least a clarification from the kind of below 3 times level that you pointed to recently. And I'm just wondering, to follow up on George's question, kind of the thought process behind refining that target leverage change. Does it actually represent a shift and is it based on where you think we are in the economic cycle or discussions with investors? Any color you can give there?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Clarity. Mark said it. We're going to maintain an investment-grade credit rating and we think that at those leverage targets it is very supportive of our current rating. No more than that.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, just shifting to a kind of bigger picture question. Mark, the Chinese Government has discussed I think banning imports of pretty much all grades of recovered fiber, which seems like it could have pretty profound impacts to global supply chain.","I'm just wondering how you think that could impact IP over the mid- to long-term in terms of OCC prices domestically, or opportunities to send pulp or kraftliner into China, or maybe unintended consequences. Whatever thoughts you could share on kind of what this shift could mean.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","That's a great question, Anthony. And obviously, we're spending a lot of time trying to figure out strategically different options if you play these statements out to reality. Bottom line, though, is China's got a dynamic economy. It's going to need fiber in the long-term.","And from an International Paper standpoint, given we have a large position in the new fiber, virgin fiber, which then becomes, as you know, recovered fiber around the world, we feel very well positioned to be a major player in that value-added fiber, whether it's in the form of a finished product or semi-finished product like containerboard, or whether it's in a less finished like, for example, our softwood pulp from Ilim.","It's hard to see and I don't pretend to know what the Chinese Government is thinking around the puts and takes. If a position like that hurts one industry in China, but it helps another and helps trade balances. There's a lot of that at play. We're going to monitor it very well. But I think the big picture is that the world is going to need more fiber for all of these sustainable fiber-based products over time.","There'd be dislocations from time-to-time and where it's generated and where it's used. But I think, from an International Paper business model, we are very well positioned with the world's best fiber to be a major player in providing that fiber need in different stages of the value chain, different levels of product sophistication. We feel good about that and we'll continue to try to monitor it and be ready to take full advantage of the position we can play.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. One question that's really striking me here is you just had a great quarter. You're laying out terrific momentum coming into the third quarter. The stock though is trading off and it's trading near the low of recent ranges. And certainly one of the catalysts this morning probably is the Cascade announcement that they're looking to go forward with that purchase and a potential conversion of a mill in Virginia.","I mean, how concerned are you at this juncture about the capacity that has been announced? And as you overlay what you see happening demand-wise and expect to continue to happen demand-wise, how concerned are you? And are there things that you think are in your capabilities that will help you manage the various scenarios that could play out that you could talk to?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Mark, that's a loaded question with a lot of potential directions it can go in. But let me just say the way we look at this. We just had a recent period where a couple of million tons of containerboard, various types of containerboard were going to be added to the U.S. market. And the underlying box demand, the products that worked versus the products that didn't, I think we navigated through that pretty well.","This is another potential global sense in the future. We believe fiber-based packaging is growing. We don't know how many of these projects are going to actually come to fruition and what type of end-product quality. We think it starts with our customers that buy the packaging. And so, that's why we spend so much time saying things like commercial excellence. There's a lot behind those two words.","And by having the customer relationships and having the best value chain from tree to box and the recycled fiber in between, we believe we'll be well-positioned, better positioned than anyone really to really benefit from that. So I think it's a robust market. It's a resilient market. And I think we have some very recent history that we can look at and draw some parallels to. And we're going to always make the containerboard in our system that we need for the box orders we have.","And right now, you've got containerboard systems in the case of International Paper basically running wide open and full, which is actually not sustainable with respect to customer service and the flexibility you need beyond just when you take mills down for maintenance. So, hard to predict the future. Some of this is way out to 2021 and 2022. But we are very confident in our position. We're confident in the role that we're playing and some of the capacity that will come on. And we're very, very confident in our ability to serve customers on the box end, because that's what really matters in all of this is are you a preferred supplier for the actual package.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you for all the color. And just kind of as a follow-on, for instance, with the Riverdale project, if the uncoated freesheet market continues to perform quite well as it is now, is that type of where maybe you have flexibility and you do that a little bit slower and you wait for that corrugated box demand growth to absorb the capacity, or are those things that are sort of set and it gets done in the timing that's been laid out?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","I'll ask Tim to comment on that, given it's a near-term project and there's some unique product given it's got the white top component.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. So the paper margins are important, but we're really looking at what our Industrial Packaging customers are requiring and we're investing in better capability to supply a better product to them through our integrated channel. So this gives us options for a better white top product, more brown containerboard in the geographies where we need it and in the grades and basis weights that we need. So we would see that project continuing on a timeline that we laid out when we announced it targeting mid-2019.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens, Inc.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Morning. You mentioned that you're seeing improved demand in white paper. Obviously, the quarter was off. So can you give us a little bit of a sense of what you're seeing shifting there? And also was there a negative mixed shift in paper? The results were obviously excellent. The costs were fantastic. But I was surprised that the price realization wasn't even a little better.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. So, no, on the demand side, we were hit by two things. We had the operational issues in Europe around Kwidzyn, the fire and then reliability issue that's since been corrected. And then, we had the truckers' strike in Brazil, which obviously impacted supply chains for a period of time.","In North America, it's really been the performance of our customers, stronger year-over-year sequential demand of our product from us. So those are the main reasons, Mark.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then just one other question. Can you give us a sense of where your pulp mix can go from here and what the timeline you're expecting? And also what kind of an operating rate you've got in pulp right now?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Well, we're running the system flat out. In fact, one of the challenges in the quarter was just product availability, given how much demand we have. And so we don't see that really changing as we're in the third quarter and going into the fourth quarter. We're 75% today, and the goal is to keep as much as we can adding to our fluff and specialty pulp mix, which could approach 85% at a point in time.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Mark, there is just one thing on the pulp. We do have a part of our capacity is the NBSK asset in Canada. So there's kind of a base load of non-fluff. It's a very good product. It's high quality and very profitable. The plan would not to be to convert that obviously to fluff.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Sure.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","But I think Tim's comment about probably 85% in the absorbent markets and then some of the specialty markets that are not exactly absorbent end uses would be where we think we can get to.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Fantastic. Thank you.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you and good morning, everyone. So, just to start, I mean obviously great quarter on Industrial Packaging. But, clearly, Brazil and Europe are still challenged. Will Madrid be enough to get you to where you want to be? I mean, the integration level, I think you said would be 60%. But will it get you to cost capital returns or do you need something virgin over there as well?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Hi. This is Tim, Steven. We are already integrated on a virgin basis with our operations here in North America. So we think we have that piece covered for our European converting business.","Will Madrid take us all the way to cost of capital? It'll get us darn close. So it's a big factor in terms of product availability for the basis weights and grades that are growing the fastest. And so, as Mark referenced earlier, it gets us to 60% integration on recycled. And we think in the range for the integrated business converting and mill gets us mid-teens on EBITDA margins but with a lower capital base. So, should get us pretty close to cost of capital over time.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Yeah. I think Tim said it right. It's a little bit of a unique business model because, as we've described the channels to market, we make the kraftliner in North America. We ship it, in this case, over the ocean and we convert it in Europe. So you can draw sort of a box around that part of the channel. And then we were buying on the open market all of our recovered fiber, except for a small mill in the Moroccan business.","Now, we're going to be 60% integrated. There's still 40% of the recycled paper that we don't make or won't make. But we're a pretty good buyer. And where our geographies are, we should be able to buy that economically. And then there is virgin medium in the European context, the semi chemical medium, which we do not make. But we're a very good customer of the premium suppliers.","So, when you put all that together, that channel to market from board to box is going to be cost of capital. It's just not measured the same way as a single geography would be because, as I said, the containerboard that's virgin is actually captured in the North American Industrial Packaging results.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Got it. And then one other question. If in fact China is permanently out of the OCC market and, by extension, re-emerges as a virgin board buyer, which mills in your system are well-suited to serve that market? And I guess that would exclude Ilim, which is obviously close.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Would exclude Ilim? I don't get that point.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Well, I mean, I'm sure you'll say, well, Ilim is adjacent to China, so that's our conduit into China. But if they need board from North America, are any of your mills...","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Actually...","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","strategically (46:18) situated or would you wish you had something on the West Coast?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","We do.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","No, we do. We have a mill on the West Cost and it does ship our product to China and other parts of Asia. But we also have Southern mills that are positioned very close to ports and have product capability and they ship as well.","And Ilim today has a small amount of capacity around kraftliner board that they do ship into Northern Central China and supply that part of the market. So I think we're well-equipped across a number of geographies for supply to China if we need it.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Well, thank you both.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Thank you.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark, just a follow-up on, I think it was Mark Weintraub's question earlier. How do you think about the relationship between the level of North American containerboard industry margins and how much competition they attract? It seems as if margins have reached a level that have clearly attracted a number of companies. And given that, how sustainable do you think the current margins are?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","I think the \u2013 it's a good business. So there's always going to be interest in a good business. But the absolute containerboard margins aren't really the final equation. The final equation is the box and having the ability to address all of the various needs of the box customers.","And so I think there's going to be a pretty resilient value chain for a company like International Paper that makes both steps of the value chain, the containerboard from very competitive softwood fiber, all the way through to the box. And I think that's going to continue to be the hallmark of that business. It's a lot more.","And I think, again, I'd just refer us back to just a couple of years ago, there's a lot more than just adding containerboard capacity and having that really work out in a sustainable way as an investment. You've got to see it all the way through to the box customer.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. And just one on the China situation again. I think RISI reported that of the 10 lowest cost mills in the country now, 7 were 100% percent recycled in the second quarter. Obviously, China is not changing its policy or doesn't appear to be doing so, which is why all these Chinese companies are building mills that touch outside of China.","I mean, do you have any reason to expect the current state of affairs in terms of virgin versus recycled mills, and which one is cost advantaged versus the other to change anytime soon in the U.S.?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Anytime soon, I think that would depend obviously on primarily the recovered fiber price, and it is a wildcard to figure out exactly where China's end game is on this because that's the big lever. And then the rest of the inputs, energy and primarily natural gas, that would be the other input that you would have to track.","And then, at some point, you just look at the fiber balance and I think it's dislocated right now because of China. But if any growth in recovered fiber comes at the expense of virgin fiber, you can quickly do the math. And then you're now creating less generation of recovered fiber for every ton that you theoretically would displace a virgin. So it ends pretty quickly.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning, Mark. Hi, Tim. Welcome back to the CFO role. My first question has to do with CapEx. I noticed that it was a bit higher than it was year-to-date last year, of course without the consumer business \u2013 well, that's taken out.","But the point being, are you still looking for around $1.5 billion CapEx or have you re-thought that, especially given some of the tax deductibility, and maybe you found some projects that you didn't have otherwise?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","No. The plan hasn't changed. It's just the function of timing, Chip. Given outage schedules and project schedules, it just disproportionally fell into the first half of this year. So we're 60%, 60-plus-percent complete on the capital plan for the year.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. Got you. And then, following up on the whole discussion about China, we know last week that their Environmental Ministry is possibly looking to cease all waste paper imports, which would suggest to me they would basically have to re-footprint about 18 million tons, which is like half our industry. That would also seem to suggest that OCC does stay down while board prices, because of the shortage there, stay up.","I didn't know if that was any of your thinking when you were thinking of getting much bigger in Europe in a hurry, because it looks like that they're going to benefit for years, while we see how China re-footprints itself. And even leaving that aside, are there other thoughts you might have about how your strategy could change if we do see a scenario where China basically needs to re-footprint a very major amount of containerboard on a global scale?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So I think, Chip, the first part of your question, was that a factor in our interest in building a bigger business in Europe. No, not really. The interest in Europe was we believe it's a good market and we can build a competitive operation by what we were trying to do. And, obviously, the things that affect the price of the raw material like recovered fiber matter. But you have to believe they're going to change structurally over time. And if you just do the mass balance of fiber, it's hard to find scenarios that really structurally change that for a long period of time that you would justify an investment on.","As far as what China is trying to do, I think it's very difficult to predict. I mean, it's extremely popular right now for trade positions by countries to take a very extreme position, see what kind of effect you have, and we seem to be doing it in our trade discussions. I think others are taking positions that, to all of us, look illogical on the surface. But there may be an actual end game in mind or a position that's somewhere south of that extreme position that ends up being where they really want to go. And I think we just have to game it out, think it through and be ready for different scenarios, and that's what we're doing.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Got you. And real quickly on fluff pulp. You mentioned the growth rates and how you're up I think you said to about 75% of your mix. Do you see a situation as the market grows where you might need to make a capacity change in the next three years to five years there? Or do you think you can just instead not add any capacity and just transition more of your paper grade into fluff?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. What we're doing, Chip, and what we will do is look at the customers we have, the demand they have, and we're going to work hard whether it's through capacity additions or optimization to make sure that we can supply them product they need.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.","John Dunigan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is actually John Dunigan on for Scott. How are you doing, Mark, Tim, Guillermo?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hi, John.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Good morning.","Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.","Good morning.","John Dunigan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, realizing we're a bit late in the call, I'll just keep my questions to one for right now. You held on to the 15%-plus EBITDA growth rate for the year again obviously. But do you believe free cash flow can grow at that same clip or is there anything either positive or negative that couldn't cause free cash flow to dislocate from the EBITDA growth?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","I think, over time, we should expect to see free cash flow grow as we generate more cash from operations. The comment I made about the quarter was simply, as Tim just reiterated, CapEx timing. But, no, our expectation is to grow free cash flow because we're growing cash from operations.","That's not automatically going to result in incremental CapEx. But as part of our capital allocation, we should be able to show the returns for that incremental CapEx that's in cost reduction and in the strategic category of capability and, in some cases, some capacity debottlenecking. But we want to lift the entire cash flow equation from cash from ops as well as free cash.","John Dunigan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for getting me on. Two quick questions, one on paper in Brazil and the other clarifying on guidance. There were just some trade articles about producers in Brazil sending offset to Mexico and avoiding duties. I was just wondering if that has a financial impact on IP or any thoughts on an impact to trade flows going forward. And then I'll move on to guidance aspect.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Hi, Debbie. It's Tim. No, we don't see any impact on anything that we have done up to this point. It's hard to speculate on what might happen going forward. But any change that did happen would not be retroactive in any way.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, on guidance, you did note an uptick in paper volumes in Brazil. I think last year they actually went down sequentially. Am I missing something there? And then I don't think I caught your inflation guidance for Industrial Packaging. Not sure if you gave an exact number on that.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Inflation guidance for?","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just in the sequential bridge that you gave. It's kind of an uptick in freight logistics cost.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. We didn't break it out, but you can follow up with Guillermo. But, in general, in Industrial Packaging in North America, we have usually between $110 million and $130 million on an annual basis of inflation in the business. And then what \u2013 I'm sorry, I forget the other question that you have.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You just mentioned you put in the guidance that you would expect Brazil that volumes to be higher sequentially I believe and when I look last year, that pattern doesn't hold. So I just wanted to know if there was something there that...","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Okay. No, we do expect them to be up. I don't remember if there was some unique circumstance last year. But from second to third quarter, we expect them to be up slightly.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back over to Guillermo.","Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Sarah. And thank you again for joining our second quarter earnings call. As always, Michelle and I will be available for your follow-up questions. Let me now turn it back over to Mark for some closing remarks.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Guillermo. Just to wrap up. As you've heard from our remarks, we're very pleased with our second quarter, a very strong performance. International Paper employees executed very well in a very strong economic environment, running our operations close to full.","We're very excited about the great outlook that we see for the rest of the year across all of our businesses. I think we're hitting on all cylinders right now and we have a balance of really good commercial performance with our customers and our product offerings, as well as we're running very well.","So we appreciate your interest in our company and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2018 International Paper Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Guillermo Gutierrez, you may begin.","Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.","Thank you, Sera. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","There is important information at the beginning of our presentation that you should take time to read including certain legal disclaimers on slides 2 through 7. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. As noted on slide 3, a reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter 2018 press release and today's presentation slides.","Relative to the Ilim Joint Venture and Graphic Packaging investments, slide 4 provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. As indicated by the information on slides 5 through 7, International Paper's proposal to acquire Smurfit Kappa is governed by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under Irish Takeover Rules, International Paper Management is prohibited from discussing any material information or significant new opinion that has not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares in International Paper or Smurfit Kappa is encouraged to consult his or her professional advisor.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin the presentation on slide 8. International Paper delivered solid first quarter performance and strong year-over-year earnings growth. We continue to see healthy demand and solid fundamentals across our global businesses. Price realization momentum continues across all three of our businesses, and we remain focused on delivering differentiated and innovative solutions to the right segments and the right customers.","Operationally, we executed well in a heavy maintenance outage quarter and managed through weather-related disruptions and other unusual events. We completed approximately 35% of our scheduled maintenance outages in the first quarter and we expect to have 75% of our total maintenance outages complete by the end of the second quarter. Transportation and other input costs were a headwind in the quarter with higher wood, chemicals and energy more than offsetting the lower recovered fiber or OCC cost. And on equity earnings, our Ilim joint venture in Russia delivered record performance.","Turning to the financial results on slide 9. Revenue increased by nearly 10% year-over-year, reflecting strong commercial performance and solid global demand. This includes record first quarter shipments of Fluff & Specialties in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. EBITDA improved 19% year-over-year. This performance reflects the solid business fundamentals and margin expansion across our businesses. In fact, we had record first quarter EBITDA in Industrial Packaging. Total equity earnings were $95 million including our Ilim joint venture as well as our 20.5% ownership interest in Graphic Packaging. Cash from operations improved by $30 million year-over-year, while free cash flow decreased, largely due to the fact that we spent nearly one-third of our $1.5 billion 2018 capital plan during the first quarter.","I'll now turn it over to Glenn who will cover performance across our businesses and our second quarter outlook. Glenn?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on slide 10 in the presentation, which shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 of $0.94 bridged sequentially from the fourth quarter of last year as well as our 2017 first quarter results of $0.56 as a year-over-year reference.","Operating earnings improved year-over-year largely due to $0.51 higher revenue driven by the flow through of pricing initiatives across all our segments as well as mix and volume growth. Sequentially from the fourth quarter, as you can see on the bridge, we saw continued price and mix gains of $0.10 from both prior year and current increases. However, given seasonality, this was more than offset by softer volumes as expected.","On a seasonal basis, although demand remains quite strong. As Mark mentioned, operations were impacted by weather disruptions, primarily frigid conditions across the east and heavy rainfall in the south, as well as other unusual events which ended up impacting the quarter by approximately $50 million or roughly $0.08 but will not repeat. A detailed reconciliation of these events is included on page 24 in the appendix. And while we are still evaluating potential insurance recovery, keep in mind these were discrete events with discrete deductibles, so any recovery is unlikely to be material.","That said, our operations on balance performed well despite these upset conditions and in an otherwise very heavy planned maintenance outage quarter. Supply chain costs continue to trend higher due to very tight rail and truck availability as well as higher diesel fuel costs. And looking forward, it is hard to see much relief here, so we believe this headwind will linger.","On fiber, lower OCC costs were largely offset by seasonally higher wood costs, and energy and chemicals were higher sequentially.","Lastly, Ilim delivered sequentially higher equity earnings and we also reported equity earnings from Graphic Packaging of $8 million, which was offset by purchase accounting deductions of approximately $6 million in the quarter.","Moving now to our segment performance, I'll start with Industrial Packaging on slide 11. The business delivered a record first quarter result of $464 million EBIT despite weather and unusual events and heavy planned outages. Both domestically and globally we continue to see strong demand across our channels to market with export containerboard up approximately $40 per ton sequentially and continued flow through in domestic box.","As expected, volume was seasonally soft, but we were in a position to repatriate volume from export markets to meet U.S. demand as our system remains oversold. Operations were $54 million lower versus the fourth quarter driven by weather events, which impacted results by approximately $31 million. The remainder was largely Pensacola insurance recovery in the fourth quarter of 2017 that did not repeat.","In terms of the heavy planned outages already referenced, we completed approximately 35% of our annual plan during the quarter including pulling up some work opportunistically at the mills impacted by the upset conditions.","Lastly, higher wood costs for energy, chemicals, and transportation more than offset lower OCC costs in the quarter.","Taking a closer look at segment positioning in the North America corrugated packaging market on slide 12, we outperformed the industry in the first quarter, largely due to our strong overweight positions in the fastest growing segments. And while our scale and footprint enables us to serve just about every corrugated segment in a material way across North America, our deliberate focus on the fastest growing segments, those benefiting from secular growth trends is paying dividends as we apply our vast network of packaging design and innovation expertise to meet and exceed our customers changing needs. Leading the way in both e-commerce and fresh produce and protein, our objective is to grow with these markets over time and to be well aligned with the market leaders in these segments.","So turning to the next slide 13, our approach to innovation begins by fully understanding the needs of our customers through the value chain to the end customer. Across the business, we have segment specific innovation teams that work with our customers to develop value creating solutions. Pictured here, we have an award winning retail beverage display with immediate brand recognition, combining functional design with storage capability, while also very easy to move and reposition for maximum visibility. Our club store box with a tear out window for frozen protein that improves retail efficiency by simplifying restocking. In e-commerce box with impactful print inside that allows for added branding and enhances the cost to consumer unboxing experience, and a printed point of purchase bin for watermelon season. So these are just a few examples of solutions we bring to our customers every day.","Moving to our Global Cellulose Fibers business on slide 14, we continue to see robust global demands, particularly in absorbance and specialties, which represents about 75% of our business. Pricing mix improved $12 million versus the fourth quarter and volume was down partially unexpected seasonality, but also unplanned lower shipments of NBSK from our Grande Prairie mill in Canada due to ongoing rail service issues, which have now been largely mitigated. Our North America pulp mill operations took the brunt of the weather disruptions, which impacted results by approximately $12 million in the first quarter and maintenance expenses were $50 million higher sequentially as we completed the heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year. All-in, we are very pleased with the strong performance and progress of the business, stepping up EBIT by $66 million versus the first quarter last year with record fluff shipments.","Turning to slide 15, one of the most exciting aspects of the Global Cellulose Fibers business is our R&D capabilities. Our innovation engine is essential to how we create value for our customers and IP. It starts with our basic philosophy of global reach and local execution. Remember that we export approximately 85% of our North America production.","Our business brings together a world-class technology center with leading industry experts and strong customer technical support networks. We create value by understanding and addressing customer needs through a robust product development process that currently has more than 1,000 patents.","A very recent example of how we're bringing innovation to our customers is our new absorbent fiber called Elegance, which we launched in Asia last week. This innovative fiber is especially desirable for adult incontinence consumers who value discretion. And there's more to come, we have a rich product development pipeline underpinned by our unique capabilities and innovation engine that is well-positioned to create value for our customers and IP. All of which fuels the path to our target mix improvements.","Moving now to Printing Papers on slide 16. We are now clearly seeing improving global demand. With the Southern Hemisphere and Eastern Europe more than offsetting slower secular declines in Western Europe and North America and in the North America supply demand balance, we see a backdrop that has improved significantly from last year and we continue to realize announced price increases.","On an enterprise basis, price improved sequentially by $22 million and we see that as continued realization globally. Mix was a $9 million headwind unexpected seasonally lower demand in Brazil and volume was also seasonally lower in Latin America and Europe as expected. Operations were $8 million unfavorable, driven by weather impact in North America and unplanned downtime at our Kwidzyn mill in Poland.","Distribution in North America continues to face headwinds, which we expect to continue as we explore improvement options. Also, like the other businesses, frontend loaded on outages, Printing Papers completed more than 35% of its scheduled maintenance outages in the first quarter and will complete nearly 85% by the end of the second quarter. Input costs were higher, primarily due to seasonal wood costs in North America and Europe, and higher purchase pulp cost in Brazil and Europe. But overall, we feel really good about our outlook in Printing Papers this year with a stronger demand environment and better industry fundamentals, all of which allows us to focus on our commercial excellence.","Turning to slide 17, our Ilim joint venture generated record EBITDA and equity earnings in the first quarter with EBITDA margins of 43% and an annualized ROIC of more than 25% associated with our investments. During the quarter, we also received $160 million in dividends, representing another year of solid cash distributions.","On slide 18 before moving to the second quarter outlook, we show our strong trend of revenue performance across all three of our business platforms on a year-over-year basis by quarter, looking through to the next quarter. We see the strong growth as a reflection of improving industry fundamentals and outcome of our customer product and geographical segmentation, we see this as sustainable, and importantly, early in this current phase of margin expansion. While price underpins a portion of this trend, volume and mix improvements are meaningful components as we focus on bringing differentiated value to our customers. Looking through to the end of this year, revenue growth will continue to accelerate in all three segments as we realize recent price increases grow and improve our mix. In fact, we expect a year-over-year CAGR in Industrial Packaging, Cellulose Fibers and Printing Papers to be 6%, 9%, and 4%, respectively from 2016 through the end of this year.","Now, turning to our second quarter outlook on slide 19, in our Industrial Packaging Global segment, we expect to see a $25 million benefit from recent price increases in North America packaging and export containerboard. While mix is expected to be a $10 million headwind globally, volume is expected to increase seasonally with a benefit of $35 million. In operations, the non-repeat of the prior quarter's weather disruptions is expected to be a benefit of $28 million, which will partially offset, which will be partially offset by about $10 million, largely due to LIFO inventory revaluation charges on previously announced price increases. Outages will be $11 million higher and input costs expected to decrease by about $20 million.","In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect to see a $15 million benefit due to recent price increases and mix improvements. Volume will be sequentially flat with continued strong demand and a non-repeat of weather disruptions is expected to be a benefit of $12 million with a modest offset of $5 million due to higher distribution costs. Outage expenses will be $26 million lower, although still another heavy maintenance outage quarter.","In our Global Printing Papers business, the benefit of recent increases and mix improvement is expected to be about $20 million and volume is expected to improve by $10 million on seasonally stronger demand globally. Operations will be flat quarter-over-quarter and maintenance outages will be higher by $11 million. You can see our outlook for Ilim JV and Graphic Packaging partnership on the equity row of the slide. And lastly, in terms of corporate and interest expense and as well our estimated effective tax rate, they remain consistent with our previous disclosures.","So with that, now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Glenn. We're very pleased with the performance in the first quarter and the momentum that we carry in 2018, which is underpinned by healthy demand and solid fundamentals globally. As Glenn mentioned earlier, we continue to see profitable revenue growth across our three businesses. We also have meaningful catalysts that will further improve our performance including the startup of the Madrid mill later this quarter, which will produce 400,000 metric tons of high performance lightweight recycled containerboard for our European packaging business. We also have more runway as we optimize our Global Cellulose Fibers business, which is already well ahead of our investment commitment, and in our papers business, we're seeing improved demand globally. Looking forward, we have clear line of sight to 10-plus-percent EBITDA growth and strong cash generation in 2018, with an improving trend of performance throughout the year.","Before we open the call for questions, I recognize there's a high level of interest in our proposal to acquire Smurfit Kappa. At this point, there is no new information to share. We have a compelling proposal on the table and we're disappointed we haven't been able to engage with Smurfit Kappa. Relative to the Q&A session of this call, I'd like the focus on the quarter and the strong year we have ahead of us.","With that, we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to touch on, as I look across, the main business here \u2013 thank you Guillermo for some of the new slides and some of the color. It looks like one of the things that isn't in there any longer, it's kind of the volume and the price per ton outlook that you used to provide in the back, perhaps could you give us some color as to you know where you are in realization of some of the price in the containerboard and in the cellulosic fiber business, what's and if perhaps you could remind us what yet you have announced out there yet, particularly on the pulp side, there seemingly is a new announcement everyday there but what IP's announced, and how we might see that flow through over the balance of the year?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Chris, this is Mark. Thanks for the question. I'll just make an overall statement about the pricing movement across the business as you mentioned. As we've said I think on the last call, we expect and we're seeing what we would say as a normal realization pattern both in the Industrial Packaging business and in the Cellulose Fibers business. But with some particulars, I'll ask Glenn to try to cover a couple of the particulars that you asked.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah, Chris. Hi, Glenn here. The way I would think about that is basically what we shared back in January was 10% plus EBITDA growth. And what we share there relative to pricing and volume was primarily the carryover of price increases that were implemented in 2017. You're absolutely correct, and as Mark said, we have had further announcements and we are implementing current prices. What we see there is those increases change our view, make it more confident in the 10% plus and we will see them roll out as scheduled through the remainder of the year as upside to our views. For example, the March 1 containerboard increase on boxes is a tailwind to the previous stated 10% plus or...","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","And Chris, just a reminder on what I said about normal realization in that box price example that Glenn just referenced. It's normal for us across segments and the mix of customers that we have to see two to three quarters of our implementation until we get to full realization. And we expect that to be what plays out in this particular increase.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. This is incremental. That's where I was going with this as to what you've got there.","Second question I had, Mark, and I appreciate you don't want a lot of questions about Smurfit on the call, but could you just perhaps give us a sense of the decision tree that you worked through with respect to timing? I mean, obviously, this isn't a bid that has a shelf life forever but kind of the decision tree as to when you feel you have to make a decision and then get back to run what you do on a regular day-to-day basis without the overhang?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So, I appreciate the question, and as I mentioned at the start of the Q&A, there really isn't anything new to report on that. There's a process that we're in right now and we will continue to look at our options, but I'm not really at liberty to say what the next process or as you said decision tree is.","Fundamentally though, if you look at the performance of the company, we're running the company very, very well and that's where our focus is right now.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I might have missed this, but I had a question probably more for Glenn on the equity income line. You mentioned or in the slides that basically it looks like almost all of the equity income, the $95 million, was from Ilim or said differently, only $3 million would have come from Graphic. And so could you just walk through why that apparently was only $3 million?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Chip, absolutely. So, subsequent to Graphic making their earnings release, we saw a number of $12 million. We got an estimate, a pre-estimate of that of $8 million and we had corporate accounting changes or corporate accounting adjustments that took $6 million off of that. So, the net-net is essentially $3 million that showed up, we'll true up the difference in further quarters. But that's essentially how we get to the math. You're right, the large percent of the $95 million is Ilim.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood. And it seems like that would be sort of their GAAP number and not their \u2013 if I'm not missing, if I have this right, and not their adjusted number. They basically had twice as much adjusted income as they had GAAP income. So, is it sort of fair to say that you didn't make that adjustment?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","We made our internal adjustment from the estimate given which was $8 million to get to the $3 million answer. Ultimately, we will true up in the future from a purchase accounting standpoint.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. There was no adjustment for going from reported to adjusted earnings, okay. And then, the next question is, just want to make sure I have this right. I think you called out \u2013 roughly looks like to me a little over $100 million in net positives going from the first to the second quarter, not including pricing and industrial and fluff, but not to make you go through all those numbers, but does that sound right, a little over $100 million on a pre-tax basis of net improvements in the three segments, not counting the price in those two segments?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah. When you look at the bridge, ultimately the large portion of that is the revenue uptick across the businesses. So, yeah, directionally you're in the ballpark.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research Group.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Just to clarify, so the numbers on the outlook which you gave, and they came fast and furiously, so I'm not sure I got all of them first time, but so they did not include any potential from fluff or the box price increase or they did?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","No, they absolutely did, Mark. So, our quarter-over-quarter look into the second quarter was holistic to include all our recent increases.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And I'm sorry, so on the Industrial Packaging side, what was the price mix number 2Q V 1Q?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hi, Mark. This is Mark Sutton. So, what Glenn outlined by business, I would encourage you to follow up with Guillermo and Michelle because they can walk you through all of that detail, but the number for Industrial Packaging, Glenn decided was $25 million due to recent price increases. There's also a number for Cellulose Fibers and for paper, but the IR team will be happy to go through that with you in detail.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, just lastly, wanted to also just clarify on that from the first question. So, the 10% plus in EBITDA that did not include benefit from incremental pricing, but I think on the question it was suggested is that, that would all be additive. Is that the right way to think about it? Or are there other offsets so that we really can't do that simple math of the 10% and then whatever pricing have that additive? Just wanted to clarify that.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Yeah. So, Mark what we said on the 10% EBITDA plus outlook 90 days ago was that it included flow through from previously announced 2017 pricing actions and our outlook on input cost and other elements at that point in time. Fast forward to now, we just discussed that there was a number of new price increases that are out there. There's also movement in some of the inputs. So, that's why there's a plus sign there, and you're right, those latest price increases that have been announced for 2018 were not considered in that original outlook.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","As well as any changes to inputs or volumes that you or we may see going forward.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right. And I guess that's why I just wanted to focus on it. So, with that, today's point in time, would that be anticipated to be a partial offset or not necessarily?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Well, I think there's a net upside.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, everyone.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Good morning.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just a question on the Cellulose Fiber business. Just a little confused by the price benefit there. It seems like maybe not getting as much leverage to some of the price increases that we've seen, and I know discounting happens, but just wondering if there's just more of a delayed impact there, if we should expect the acceleration to come a little bit later in the year?","And then, just sort of relate it to the weather outages in the quarter, some of that volume, it sounds like wasn't able to get out, but it was produced and it's just sitting there. So, does that mean you know we should expect a little bit more volume than normal as you get those shipments out the door and recognize that revenue?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Good question. Two points there, this is Glenn, relative to Cellulose Fibers. One on the first question is, is we're implementing price increases and I think I heard earlier there have been a lot of incremental price increases, we're realizing those as we expect to realize them, and yes depending on which channel to market, they have varying degrees of lag. So, a lot of this is still back end loaded in this year to the extent it was already announced and is being implemented.","From a standpoint of your next question relative to...","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So what \u2013 what he asked about was volume and if there is going to be a catch up?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","So, the point there is at Grand Prairie as I said we had flow backs associated with supply chain interruptions. We lost volume there and we call that out in the summary section there. We are recovering from that, but that was a headwind and did cause us some loss volume in the first quarter.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","I would say overall some of these products were qualified and we are the primary suppliers of the idea that we will have catch-up ability is definitely in our commitment to our customers. There's strong demand for the fluff and specialty segment of the product mix and also good demand for the special market pop like, what we make in Canada. So, good operations will allow us to get more of that product out to market, so we expect strong demand and some of that we'll be able to catch-up, there's no doubt.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And just a follow-on, you know, some of the industry box shipment data that's come out shows maybe a little bit of a deceleration from the trend we were on coming out of last year. Just wondering, if you're seeing that as well, maybe if you could kind of comment under April volumes, how they've been shaping up so far and then just sort of in general, do you think if there is any deceleration, is it weather driven, economically driven or just tougher comps, any kind of color you give there will be helpful?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","I think seasonally there're some changes in box demand. I guess, it depends on an individual customers' mix. I can only speak for IP, we see continued strong fundamentals and it's broad based across many segments. And recently, we've seen box demand, the traditional offset we've seen with GDP that gap has closed and we see for the foreseeable future that that's going to be a sustainable trend. So, it's pretty strong across the segments, wherein Glenn had shared a chart in the presentation around some of the segments and where we're underweight and overweight. If you dig into the sub-segments there and the customers that participate there, you can see what drove our slide over performance to the market. And so far this quarter, box demand remains very healthy and strong.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about where your inventories stand, both on the containerboard side, both in terms of all the outage issues in the quarter? There were press reports that you had lost or were talking about with customers 100,000 tons and relative to the tightness and the logistics side of things?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Sure, Gail. This is Glenn. Overall, as I indicated in the core presentation, our businesses in North America, but across the globe are sold out. We're not \u2013 we're running with any lack of order downtime and we're hand-to-mouth so to speak to meet our customer needs and that's been exacerbated by some of the upset conditions, weather related and otherwise, in the first quarter. And some of the supply chain constraints, like we talked about at Grand Prairie. So, again, we're \u2013 our supply chain is working incredibly hard to put what we need and what customers need in inventory to support their growth. But we're tight.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. And going back to (32:46) a little bit. In the past, you've been willing to share kind of what your long-term modeling looks like and I'm just wondering if you could, I know you mentioned that would just tracking closer to GDP, but can you put some specific numbers to that and how that might have compared to this time last year?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah. We are seeing, I guess, from public information that trends right now look closer to GDP and that's a great outcome if that's sustainable. Clearly, some of the secular movements whether it's fresh food and e-commerce has closed that gap in the medium term to the extent you believe the runway on those secular trends that could be more than norm, but we're just going to have to see that play out.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","And Gail, I would just add to Glenn's answer, on the long term planning, we never live in the moment of current demand, we look at a number of different things, so that we can plan appropriately our capability and the box plans, our capacity for container board, and so that long term planning still has a very rigorous look, and it almost always is a lower number than the moment that we're in unless the moment we're in is really low, so we don't, we don't confuse in the near term, we're happy to have the near term where we have it, but our long term and our investment plan is based on a much more sober look at the overall market, and but right now, we're lucky to be able to have the capability and the footprint to serve the demand while it's there.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Thanks very much.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Leon Staphos - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details, as always. I had two questions, the first is really on the subject of your non-North American operations, we look at the paper business in, or let me rephrase it, on the one hand, North American paper, we look at the business and recognizing there is a firm amount of freight and maintenance outage burdened this quarter. Nonetheless, you know, generating a million or so of EBIT on the revenue that that segment does, does that suggest perhaps you need to take another look at this business strategically longer term, and then the related question, is getting ahead of myself, you know, when we look at the non-North American packaging businesses, again we see very modest EBIT on relatively large revenue gains. At some point, do we need to think about the strategy, the structure? Whether it's within Brazil or Europe in terms of your containerboard and Box business there? Thank you, guys.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Thanks, George. This is Glenn, and those are both good questions. Relative to North America papers, we feel great about where we are, probably we feel as good as we have in the last decade in terms of the dynamic, again we acknowledge we're in secular decline and we don't think that rate of decline has changed materially. But what we do see is our good industry fundamentals. We are shipping less exports to meet U.S. demand, and quite frankly, there are less imports coming in. So, those are good signs. We have price traction. We do have headwinds, supply chain is a headwind, but that's something \u2013 somewhat in our control that we're going to manage and optimize.","So, again, does this make us rethink of the business? No, I think this is a reinforcement that this is a cash generating business, it has the potential to \u2013 with our asset quality to draw up a lot of cash and we have assets that are very material to our other businesses. So, I think it's right in line with our strategy, but when you look at it holistically, given our geographic footprint, the printing papers around the world, it's a growth business when we're in a mid-cycle environment and we're certainly seeing that right now by the revenue growth over the last couple of years and into the future with Brazil and otherwise.","Fair point on packaging outside of North America. We have positions obviously in Europe and South America. In Europe, we're augmenting that position with catalyst, which we believe is going to make a big difference in integration, our Madrid mill, and we're quite committed to our market access in Europe, but we have some squeeze now as a non-integrated player and that's why we're addressing that with some organic moves to do this conversion. Relative to Latin America, structurally we're somewhat impaired there, but we're growing our market access, we're building customer relationships, and I'm not going to open up a can of worms here relative to our aspirations globally, but clearly, we see fit to improve our market access in those very profitable pools around the world through acquisitions if we can do it at the right price.","George Leon Staphos - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, I want to just follow up on George's second question there and talk about the international container board operations. Can you, A, give us some sense of kind of the sequencing on Madrid ramp up and sort of how you think about that in the context of what looks like an awful lot of new supply coming in Europe over the few years. And then, secondly, down in Brazil, the business is EBITDA negative. It's been five years since you bought that business, what's a reasonable timeline to be generating reasonable returns in Brazil?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Two good questions, Mark. I appreciate them. Relative to Madrid, we have line of sight. Clearly, there were some obstacles, largely due to labor and management of that labor in Spain, but Madrid is now looking to be ramping up by the end of this quarter and we feel great about that. That addresses a primary concern. Understand the backdrop of new capacity, but we also like the growth quotient in Europe, so a lot of that new capacity we think will be absorbed by growth. The good news for International Paper is our mill is 100% integrated at day one. So, we get to keep that margin, which is meaningful now given where OCC's at in Europe and around the world. So, again, we feel it is a big step forward for our business in Europe.","Orsa continues to struggle but improve. There's year-over-year improvement two years in a row here. We're focused on our customers. We're cautious on capital allocation. So, it's really about understanding market access and understanding how to navigate Brazil in a non-recessionary environment. Line of sight, we think we have line of sight to an EBITDA positive business, that certainly isn't a return that's acceptable to us, and we'll make decisions and keep our options open on how we operate across Latin America. But clearly, we see Latin America as a profit pool we want to be a part of.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Hey, Steve.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","So, you had some extraordinary items in Q1 that were more extraordinary than normal. And you said it hit the quarter by about $0.08 and you also moved some maintenance forward. Can you quantify that on the maintenance front, either in dollar terms or in percentage terms?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah, we can, and what we talked about was the cost headwinds. There were some volume headwinds as well on that 50%. We talked about Grand Prairie maybe as another issue. But yes, of the $0.08 hit, that's going to be a non-repeat. The pull forward predominantly in Industrial Packaging, let's say that's about $15 million of outages out in the second quarter that'll come in that have already been taken care of.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. That's great. And then also a question on the Riverdale conversion. How is that going? And when does the free sheet machine there get turned off, so to speak?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","So, Riverdale is on track. We have not disclosed specifically our point at which we pull the plug. We are ultimately going to time that with the engineering and time that with market demand. But as we outlined and disclosed from a macro standpoint, we're right on track with the project and we'll keep updating you as we go along.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Steve, what we did I think when we announced a project, we talked about it being online, which would obviously mean the conversion would take the uncoated free sheet somewhere in the middle to second half of 2019, and right now, that's still our current thinking.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thank you both.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glenn, you talked earlier about OCC being low around the world. I just want to follow up on that. What are your longer term views along those lines? I know some have been of the view that OCC has to go up over time because of some eventual global fiber shortage, but we obviously have not seen evidence of that as of late. So, can you just talk about what your view is to the extent you have a strong view along those lines?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah. I think we do have a fairly firm view long-term and I appreciate you framing it long-term, because short-term is a lot more complicated answer. But long-term, it comes down to if you believe in global growth and the fact that boxes ultimately will facilitate that global growth that there will be strong demand for recovered fiber and there will be pressure on that important substrate over time. We suggest in any medium term period it can be quite volatile. This definitely impacts the trade today, forcing even different fiber streams to meet some of the needs. We'll watch it closely. We still remain very confident in North America that our low cost virgin position is a winner, but we see OCC a strategic, not only in the U.S. but around the world. And the good news, Adam, is we're located both in Europe and in North America and Brazil for that matter where it's produced. So, ultimately, we have the first access. So, we have the right to first supply, the rest of the world's growth has to come from our region. So, again, in any medium term situation, we'll have access, and over the long-term, to your original question, we see you know, incremental pressure.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sure. Why not?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Adam, I'll just add \u2013 just a high level statement around what you would have to believe to arrive at the view Glenn just described. If you believe in global growth of fiber based packaging, then you understand that OCC is going to become more and more valuable. If you look at where a lot of the growth is occurring and the source of OCC of course is a box that starts with virgin tree fiber. So, we believe in global growth, and fiber based packaging enhance the value that OCC is going to play long-term in that value chain is going to be pretty important. That should lead to a commodity that's worth a lot more. But there's always going to be dislocations like what's happening in China, but cleaning it up is the right thing to do. But it's going to cost money to do it, but it's still the best solution for that type of packaging.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Mark. And just aside from OCC, obviously, just about everything's been inflationary at least in the states in recent months, just along with an improving economy to the extent the economy continues to improve, you know, the freight, labor, chemicals, other stuff. Do you expect those buckets to remain quite inflationary as we've seen them in the recent months?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah. It's a great question. And when we look at our year-over-year view, you know, we \u2013 we do see inflationary pressure for sure. We see it in energy and chemicals. I think what we're experiencing more than that right now in terms of wood is more seasonal. But you know OCC is \u2013 is the big variable and whether that neutralizes or not, I guess will play out during the year, but certainly, transportation is structural. You know energy and chemicals is \u2013 is material. Wood, we think it stays very competitive.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much, Glenn.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hey, Scott.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Good morning.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Mark or Glenn, when I \u2013 when I look at you know slide 20 on the EBITDA guidance and then you've got the comment around strong and sustainable free cash flow on \u2013 on that slide as well. I'm just trying to triangulate down that the free cash flow. So, get 10% plus EBITDA growth in 2018, do you think you'll be able to get to a 10% plus growth in free cash flow as well or there are some things that hold it back in 2018, relative to 2017?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Good question. And we talked 10% plus, we frame the 10% plus relative to what we said last quarter and what we believe now. We don't forecast cash flow. But I \u2013 but I can say that it \u2013 it should be within \u2013 within the same conditions materially to somewhat equal.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","So, yes to the extent we have upside in EBITDA, most of that will translate into free cash flow.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, fair enough. And then, just as my follow-up question, if I look at the proxy that you filed back on April 5, in regard to compensation, there was a little bit of a change to the long-term management compensation, especially around return on invested capital, I think you move to an absolute ROIC versus a relative ROIC prior, which would seemingly give you a little bit more leeway to change your ROIC targets on a long-term basis. Can you talk about that, and am I reading that correctly?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","So, what you're, what you're seeing here is, is a change, it was a change under consultation with multiple external advisors including our board advisor. You know, we had an issue with, with relative ROIC in that \u2013 in that plan meeting versus, versus competition, just because of the variability associated with that.","While we have built in the ROIC piece of the long-term incentive plan is a structural imperative to have a meaningful spread to our cost of capital, balanced by TSR. So, again, we think a very robust view of growing the size of our intrinsic value with TSR and maintaining over time a ROIC with the spreads of the cost of capital.","So, so again, we believe a much more clear and clean way for our organization to see value creation and also to report back out on it. Clearly, the baseline for any payments is our cost of capital, but target is, is a meaningful spread of 200, and again, today we \u2013 we would do any capital allocation with that factor in mind.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Glenn. Appreciate it. Thanks, Mark.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Hi, Mark.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","So, you've described a couple of your businesses as representing attractive profit pools in this call. Can you expand on what sort of criteria you focus on in determining what constitutes an attractive profit pool. And the second question is fairly simple. Can you tell us more about commercial excellence? My guess is that that's mostly a customer focused program, but I'm wondering, if there are specific financial targets on it as well?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So, Mark, on a profit pool comment, what we look at and it's part of this framework we described around building attractive positions, building competitive positions and starting attractive markets. One of the attractiveness criteria of the market is that, there's profit to be made and that you can actually see that flow back through the value chain, so that the producer in our case of packaging has a chance to capture some of that profit.","There are other markets that have high growth rates, so that's an attractiveness criteria, but based on structure and where they are in the world, there's not much money to be made, and I think if you look at International Paper, you might conclude that our on the ground operations in Asia didn't meet our test for being able to capture a profit pool even though the market has some of the highest growth rates in the world. Instead what we did is we shifted our manufacturing focus and made products that they need in that market and produced them where they should be produced, and hence, we captured the profit pool.","For our packaging, when we look at the world, there is more value appreciated by customers, and hence, more ability to create a compelling value proposition and capture profit in the Americas and in Europe. So, that's how we think about that \u2013 that is one of several attractiveness criteria.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Great. And on commercial excellence, are there financial targets there or is that really just making customers happy?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So, I think at a high level, it's more than just making customers happy, it's really integrating what we do operationally with what we do commercially. We talk a lot about some of the programs we use to run a good operation in supply chain, in manufacturing; lean manufacturing tools, processes that evaluate data and do predictive analytics on our factories. There's a whole world of similar initiatives around helping customers find solutions to their issues and it might be that our package helps the throughput in a certain customers filling plant, things we've been working on significantly, but when you think about International Paper's journey over the last several years, building the company we have today, a lot of our focus is rightfully been on successfully bringing new people into the company, integrating acquisitions, building a really competitive set of offerings, and focusing on getting our best possible position from a cost and product quality standpoint, and blending the human side of all of that.","We've done a very good job of that. And I think it shows in our results with our returns, with our cash flow, with our dividend capability; and we want to re-energize our efforts now on taking the company we build and taking the next step in integrating commercial excellence and operational excellence. So, the targets in there are really reflective in our normal financial targets. We want to produce best-in-class margins and in some cases we already do. We want to increase our distance in our lead. It's also about profitably finding ways to grow the company. We're not a high growth company, but we should not shy away from the ability to grow our company; hence, why we talk about profitable revenue growth. So, if you've got returns like International Paper has, well above our cost of capital and you can profitably grow, you're going to create higher intrinsic value and that should be exciting for investors.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","That's super. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Marcio Farid with UBS Global Research.","Marcio Farid - UBS Brasil CCTVM SA","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have just one follow-up question on the JV Ilim, I'm not sure how much you can comment on it, but the company has clearly been performed pretty well. So, I just wanted to understand what are the long-term plans there? Do you see room for more investment on capacity growth or the idea is just to pay dividends from here? Thank you.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks for the question. Ilim is a fantastic business, it's one of the best examples we have of our competitive position of serving a really attractive market. A lot of Ilim's products end up going to Asia. There is optimization underway right now in Ilim across the business that gets exported out of the country and across the businesses that served the Russian market. And as Ilim has already in the past disclosed there's opportunity for growing that business through further investment, and that plan is underway in various stages. But business has a tremendous amount of potential, it's performing very, very well. We've got great people in that business and great assets and we have very attractive markets especially the adjacent market in Asia.","Marcio Farid - UBS Brasil CCTVM SA","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our final question does come from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Thank you. Just want to make sure I have my numbers are right. It looks like you've cut about $11 million out of the maintenance expense from the year, at least versus the first quarter and with the \u2013 looks like the $14 million extra you spent in the first quarter versus the plan means that we kind of are looking at a nickel of benefit in the back nine months in terms of the maintenance being less than what we would have thought before, you know, based on the first \u2013 the numbers in the first fourth quarter call back in February.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Hey, Chip. This is Glenn. Yeah, I mean, you caught it. Your numbers are directly correct.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Just want to make sure I got that. Thank you.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Thank you.","Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.","So, thanks, everyone for being \u2013 I'm sorry, operator.","Operator","And now, I'd like to turn it back over to Guillermo.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","And Guillermo is going to turn it back over to me. Thanks, operator. Thank you for all being on the call and for your interest in International Paper. As I said earlier in my remarks, we have a lot of momentum coming out of the first quarter, and it's driven by solid fundamentals and significant success with our customers and really all of our businesses. We look forward to delivering a very strong year of performance in 2018. We also look forward to talking to you again next quarter.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Royalty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Paula, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining International Paper's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties which are outlined on slide two of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter 2017 earnings press release and today's presentation slides.","Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide four provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our first quarter call. I'm going to begin on slide five. International Paper delivered solid results in the first quarter in what was a transitional quarter with many moving parts. And quite frankly, we see the second quarter as transitional as well given the heavy maintenance outages, some additional costs at Pensacola, input costs that are expected to remain high, and ongoing implementation of previous price increases. All of these should position IP for a very strong second half.","In the first quarter, price realizations were as expected, and we make several price increase announcement across our businesses. This includes a $50 per ton North American containerboard price increase effective in March, which was recognized by the publication index this past Friday.","In addition to that, we have announced and are implementing price increases across North American export containerboard, market softwood and fluff pulp, and our paper business in Brazil and EMEA, as well as the price increase in Consumer Packaging.","We effectively managed through a challenging situation following the January 22nd digester incident at our Pensacola mill and I'm pleased to report that the mill was back up and fully operational in early April.","The integration of our newly acquired pulp business is off to a great start and we delivered $14 million in synergies in the first quarter. Input costs across all businesses were a $55 million headwind with more than half of this driven by OCC as prices increased on average about $40 a ton versus the fourth quarter of 2016.","Additionally, IP received dividends from the Ilim JV in the first quarter totaling $127 million, reflecting a continued very strong year of financial performance at the JV in 2016.","Moving to slide six, turning to the financial results. One area that stands out is revenue, which increased almost 8% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by the addition of our newly acquired pulp business, which I would also note is a business that is growing from a demand standpoint at an annual rate of 5%.","Turning to slide seven, I'd like to provide an update on the recovery at our Pensacola mill. This, as we had said in the first quarter, was a very unfortunate incident, so I'd like to take a few moments to discuss it. First and foremost, I'd like to thank our IP employees for their extraordinary job of responding to a very difficult situation both at the mill and in the surrounding community.","In addition, I'd like to thank the Unified Command, which included representatives from the federal and state environmental protection agencies and the county health department for their cooperation and assistance in managing through to recovery.","I think, this is a great example of what we call the IP Way Forward, which is doing the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons all at a time. It's foundational to who we are as International Paper.","Within the first 48 hours following the incident, remediation teams began cleaning and repairing common areas and effected home sites. Most of this work is now complete. We took multiple steps to ensure that our customers' needs were met, including adjusting our outage schedule, shifting production to other mills, along with other mitigation efforts.","Fortunately, we were able to utilize the spare digester dome, which we had on hand to expedite the repair to get the mill back up and running in the shortest time possible. As we shared publicly during the quarter, an unusual combination of naturally produced pulping gases and pressurized air led to the explosion, which occurred, an event that we've never seen before in IP and to our knowledge as we understand that never before seen in the forest product industry.","We have taken steps to ensure that this does not happen again, and we have shared our findings with the industry globally and hope that a similar situation can be prevented in any other company in the future.","We feel very fortunate that no one was injured in this event. And with that, I'll turn it over to Glenn and let him provide financial update on the incident. And then move into the details for the quarter. Glenn?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Continuing with Pensacola on the same slide and relative to the outlook on total financial exposure we shared during the quarter, I'm pleased to report that we see things coming in at the low end of the previously disclosed range. We now see all-in costs, including $16 million for capital coming in around $80 million.","In terms of the first quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by $46 million, however, the actual financial impact in quarter one was minimized by shifting our planned maintenance outage schedule. This moved $26 million of these outages out of the quarter into the second quarter, but that's obviously more about timing.","Additionally, we booked $12 million of realized and anticipated insurance recovery in the quarter. So looking forward, we remain optimistic about our ability to recover all of our out-of-pocket costs after the deductible through insurance in the calendar year.","And as we've already shared, given the accounting treatment for the capital to repair the fully depreciated digester and the associated step-up in assets, we continue to see this as a nonmaterial earnings event in 2017.","Now moving to our quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on slide eight. Notably, we saw a meaningful uplift in price versus the fourth quarter in 2016, largely driven by implementation of our announced October price increase in North America Industrial Packaging as well as other price realizations on export containerboard and some early benefits from our pulp price initiatives.","Volume was, in general, seasonally lower across the majority of our businesses. Operations and costs were flat, inclusive of the cost associated with the disruption at Pensacola, while maintenance outage expenses were higher. Input costs were slightly higher driven by rapidly escalating prices for OCC throughout the quarter.","Finally, contribution from newly acquired pulp business, as you can see unbundled in the bridge, was impacted by significant outage expenses in the quarter, largely associated with the unique energy savings projects completed at the Port Wentworth mill and more to come on that a little later.","So, moving to the businesses on slide nine. Earnings in Industrial Packaging were lower primarily due to higher maintenance outage expenses and higher input costs, mainly OCC, as I just referenced, which together more than offset our significant price increase realizations to-date. Volume was also seasonally lower, but as expected.","So stepping back, we see the first quarter as our low point or trough in business margins for this new cycle. And as the $50 per ton price \u2013 March price increases realized on containerboard and our box business, beginning in the second quarter we also see other ongoing non-price initiatives helping, we see a period of significant margin expansion ahead for this business.","On slide 10, the graph shows, well, box prices in OCC indexed to the fourth quarter of 2015. As you can see, our box prices have recovered to just above the levels exiting 2015. However, given incrementally higher OCC costs, margins remained squeezed into the first quarter. With that said, our October price increase has been fully implemented and largely realized, with just some modest benefits coming outside this quarter as it flows through the remaining contracts.","So looking forward into the second quarter and the rest of the year, we will see the ramp-up of benefits of the March increase with the majority of the realization coming in the third and fourth quarters as it is implemented through our box contracts.","As to our outlook for OCC costs, we expect continued elevated levels in the second quarter acknowledging the peak in March and \u2013 acknowledging the peak in March and a modest downward trend since, but on average, essentially flat with the first quarter. Additionally, as global markets remain strong, we expect further earnings upside in the profitability of our export linerboard sales over the balance of the year associated with both implemented and announced increases.","Turning to global cellulose fibers and I'm on page 11, we experienced a transitional quarter from an earnings standpoint as contribution from a newly acquired pulp business was more than offset by heavy outages in that portion of the business mainly due to the Port Wentworth energy reduction project. A little background here, the project involved the boiler and turbine upgrades that will result in both chemical and energy savings over time. The project investment was $140 million, including $50 million of required maintenance capital and will generate solid returns above the cost of capital annual benefits of $15 million to $20 million of incremental EBITDA.","Additionally, back to the quarter, we saw initial benefits from our announced price increases, although the majority of the benefits will be realized over the coming months. Synergies of $14 million were achieved in the quarter and are spread across multiple bars in the bridge. And again, just to be clear, if I could draw your attention to the portion of the bridge that's highlighted with the caption, pulp acquisition, this reflects results for that portion of the business for the first quarter as compared to the one month we owned the business in the fourth quarter. The incremental $16 million represents the underlying performance of the business outside of outage expenses, but including synergies above the $17 million earned in the fourth quarter, bringing us to roughly $33 million EBIT run rate for the acquisition business in the first quarter of 2017.","I'm now on slide 12, which provides a little more perspective on our synergy plan as well as our results through the first quarter. As you can see, we're tracking synergies in three major categories: SG&A, commercial, manufacturing, supply chain. And as I said for the first quarter, we achieved $14 million in synergies split across these three categories.","Notably, our annualized run rate coming out of the first quarter is $56 million, and this is ahead of our track and expectations. On the right, you can also see how the $175 million total synergy target breaks out by category. So we remain very confident regarding our synergy opportunities and our ability to meet, more importantly, exceed this commitment over time.","Moving to slide 13. Printing Papers, was an uneventful quarter, primarily impacted by normal seasonality, largely in Brazil, resulting in lower volume and less favorable mix as we expected.","Now on Slide 14. Our Consumer Packaging segment earnings were off versus the fourth quarter of 2016 modestly as seasonally higher operating expenses, higher input costs, and a less favorable mix more than offset lower maintenance outages in the quarter.","So taking a look and stepping back at the overall SBS market on slide 15. Fundamentals have truly strengthened over the last few months. Backlogs are up 25% and operating rates improved as well. Shipments are up nearly 5% year-over-year, while inventory and trade flows have remained fairly constant.","What we believe is driving the improvement in fundamentals is a combination of factors. This includes some Q1 seasonality, a general pickup in consumer-driven demand as well as an increase in demand for place (13:34) stock and potentially some pre-buying before a relatively heavy spring outage season compared to last year.","Overall, foodservice demand is up 2.5% year-to-date in the U.S. and looking forward, continued improvements in labor markets, increases in hourly wages, strong consumer confidence, and increases in disposable income should lead to improved \u2013 continued improvements in SBS domestically going forward.","Moving to Ilim. The JV delivered a solid quarter as higher pulp prices were more than offset by seasonally lower volume and higher wood costs. The Russian ruble strengthened during the quarter resulting in an FX gain on the JV's U.S.-denominated debt. Looking to the second quarter, the JV expects seasonally stronger volumes to be partially offset by heavy maintenance outages.","Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter on page 17. We expect to see, as I referenced earlier, the initial benefits of the March $50 per ton price increase in North America Industrial Packaging, along with continued realization of price increases on export containerboard, which just in quarter two together will amount to roughly a $30 million upside. We also expect to see price increase benefits from Global Cellulose Fibers of roughly $20 million in the quarter. I would also note that our price initiatives in European papers and Brazil papers both continue to move smoothly, and we see full implementation and realization there as well.","For volume, we expect, and are experiencing at the moment typical seasonal increases in North American Industrial Packaging and Consumer Packaging which, together, should drive another $30 million increase in earnings across the businesses \u2013 across these businesses in Q2.","Looking across our remaining business, volume is expected to be relatively stable. In operations and cost, we expect significantly less costs at Pensacola, along with some seasonal improvements in our North American packaging businesses which will result in $40 million in additional earnings.","In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, the non-repeat of the issues we had at Pensacola as well as post start-up costs associated with Port Wentworth represent an additional $20 million quarter-over-quarter.","Maintenance outage expenses will peak in Q2, for the year are expected to be $82 million higher quarter-over-quarter. And input costs, we see as being generally flat, quick note back on outage expenses, 70% -- 75% of our annual outages will be completed for the year exiting Q2. In other items category, we listed our assumptions for corporate expense, interest expense, tax rate, and equity earnings from the Ilim JV.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thank you, Glenn. So I'm on Slide 18. So as Glenn just shared on the second quarter outlook on the previous slide, you can see on Slide 18 there's a lot of pricing activity underway across several of IP's businesses, so we thought it would be helpful to just put this in one place for you.","It won't go through all the details here, but we expect these changes to translate to a step-change improvement in earnings as we move into the second half of the year. And I would also note that this is just a snapshot of where we stand at this point in time relative to what's been announced and what's in progress.","On slide 19, I'll wrap-up by our comments. In addition to the pricing activity I just highlighted, we have a host of additional initiatives that set the stage for a particularly strong second half, and importantly, continued momentum as we exit 2017 and go into 2018.","These include operational and cost-savings initiatives across all of the businesses, significantly lower maintenance outages expenses in the second half and, as Glenn just outlined with 75% of those being behind us after Q2.","And accelerating benefits from the integration in Global Cellulose Fibers business as well as the start-up of the converted Madrid mill on high-performance recycled containerboard which will be for internal consumption by our European box business. We will continue to focus on allocating capital to create value with a near-term focus, as I mentioned on the last quarter's call, on debt reduction.","So with all this being said, I'm highly confident that IP can deliver year-over-year EBITDA growth with material upside to the 10% target we shared on our last earnings call.","And with that, I'd like to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operating Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you for taking my call. Just first question I want to ask was, as I look through slide 10, just to make sure I understand this right. This sort of suggest that you've got about 3% realization of box prices as I sit today during 1Q.","I mean, perhaps could you give us a sense of what the exit rate look like, I'm guessing it was probably closer to a 6%, 7% sort of range instead. And then that's again, not still inclusive of what you've got going forward with the current round of stuff that probably is another directionally 10% on top of that. So some color there will be helpful.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yes Chris, it's Tim. We did end stronger in March as we went through the quarter. And you'll remember that in the fourth quarter, the price have already started moving up. So as we exited the first quarter, we were roughly 85%, 90% realized on the price increase from the fall.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, so the kind of 3% that you've got there is what you think you're going to get out of the first piece?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","There's a little bit more to come as we go through the second quarter, just in terms of how contracts work. But we're right on track where we thought we were going to be.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. The follow-up question I had also in relation to the box business. When I look further in the back, it look like your volumes were down just a tick under 1%. I think industry numbers through the first quarter were up 2% to 3% depending on what you looked at. I do appreciate you had an outage, is there anything \u2013 how should we think about that, is it just perhaps customers kind of source from other folks in the near run while they knew you were having some issues and it kind of comes back towards market as the year progresses or do you feel you had any share losses or how would we think about that?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","I'm sorry, Chris. I guess the first part of your question, you're talking about box volume?","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, in the back slide that showed down 0.7% through the quarter, I think the industry was up 2% to 3%. Just helping me put that together.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yes, I mean, we look at it on an ongoing basis and there's noise in the quarter, right. So we had some exposure to our ag position given the heavy rains and the delay in crops. We also saw some weakness in beverage. I don't think it's a trend. I think that you're going to see noise quarter-to-quarter. Especially with us. I mean, our focus is on managing margins at the end of the day. We're going to have some segment exposure from time to time, but over time we expect to grow in line with market.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Good luck guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call and the details. If we could talk at all about what kind of run rate you're seeing, recognizing it's early in the quarter, during 2Q. Within the containerboard and box system, but also across your other businesses, that's my first question.","And then secondly, I was just trying to do some quick math on your heat map chart and considering also the slight or a decline in Ilim sequentially. Should we ballpark the expecting sort of flat to slightly up in terms of earnings for 2Q versus 1Q, is that the correct takeaway, or did we miss something here? Thank you guys.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Hey George, its Tim. I'll start on the demand side. We continue to see really strong demand on the export side. In fact, our customers have been frustrated, but highly appreciative of the way that we work through the Pensacola incident in terms of being transparent with them and really working hard to cover their needs. And our demand in the second quarter will grow.","On the box side through April, it looks like we're trending close to 2% on a daily and still working through some of the Ag that is beginning to pick up and some of the other segment exposures that we have. We feel really good about box demand so far. In fact, I think our view on the year total market is we're anticipating growth on a daily between 1.5% to 2%, probably closer to 2%.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Hi, George, this is Glenn responding to the heat map question and the direction for the second quarter. Yeah, I think, you're directionally correct. As Mark said, the second quarter is also another transitional quarter, but it's more than just flat. There's upside in the second quarter as we really go into the very, very strong second half.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","George, this is Mark. Just to finish your demand question. I mentioned it in my remarks that strong demand plus 5% in our Cellulose Fibers business and we see that continuing. We've got a great customer list, and so we're well positioned geographically as well as with individual accounts. We're seeing some strength in the part of Consumer Packaging markets that we participate in.","And over in Europe, our packaging business demand is solid. Paper is a similar story to what it has been, but it's not different than what we thought, still declining in the developed markets, but we do see some growth in Brazil. And, again, Brazil has tremendously powerful export position, so we serve multiple markets.","So I would say our view of demand across our products gets to some of the comments I made about good, strong business fundamentals, solid activity on the pricing front and the internal initiatives we have around cost savings and how we manage outages this year, all set us up very well for a really exciting second half.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tim, one on e-commerce. I would have thought you'd have been a big beneficiary of e-commerce growth in the quarter, but obviously, your volume was down close to 1%. Can you talk about how much you're actually benefiting from e-commerce on the volume side as well as what impact you think e-commerce is having both on OCC costs as well as your price\/mix?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. I mean, some of this is speculative, right, because we only have our view. But I think e-commerce is growing more rapidly and will continue to grow more rapidly than brick-and-mortar. And I don't know where that stops. They're penetrating in a lot of areas. We had a very good quarter in the first quarter with e-commerce. But compared to prior years, you go through the holiday season and then as you hit January, there's always a return period and there's promotions.","And that part felt a little bit lighter this year, maybe people did a better job buying the right-size products through the holidays. On the OCC front, I do believe that it is beginning to have an impact in terms of fiber flows and recovery. I just don't know how much and I don't know how far it goes. But it does feel like just given how much is being purchased online, that it is skewing OCC availability, at least at certain times of the year.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And then just one on the box price increase, how would you characterize the fall ball box price increase implementation? And how do you think the spring box price implementation \u2013 increased implementation will differ, if at all, from the fall implementation? Thank you very much.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. I'm very positive on the spring price implementation. I think we see our supply chain has been very tight, now part of that is Pensacola. But we ran at what were historically low inventory levels in the first quarter and did a lot of scrambling quite frankly, just to try to keep up as much as we could.","I think box demand has been good, and so we look at it, and we see a normal type of implementation as we work through all of the conversations with our customers. And the bulk of it will start in the second quarter, the bulk of it will come in the third, and there will be a little tail as we go into the fourth quarter.","Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.","Go to next question...","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. With all the price action, I appreciate the slide, page 18. And just wanted to maybe flush out a little bit if possible. So how much fluff pulp versus NBSK, SBSK would annual production be roughly?","Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.","So, we are \u2013 hi, Jean-Michel speaking. Good morning, Mark. We are roughly 2 million tons, a bit more, 2.2 million tons on fluff and 800,000 tons on market pulp to-date, with the proportion going up in fluff and specialty and have (28:12) specialty with fluff in Consumer Products. (28:15) specialty. So on the mix, which is one of the big initiative we're having around fluff and specialty is growing. Ultimately I think we'll probably be 2.3 million tons, 2.4 million tons plus specialty versus 600,000 tons on market pulp net short and that's the (28:33) target.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And on the slide on page 18, it notes that there's $115 per ton of announced and published price initiatives on fluff. How should one think about how these increases tend to get put in, and how they tend to stays in over time? Is it fairly immediate, or is it that it does take a while because of the way contracts are set up for it to show up on the bottom line?","Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.","So let me back up two seconds and then answer your question. You have to be fair what is SBSK, NBSKs and fluff. SBSK and NBSK is relatively fast, it's not immediate, but between the announcement and the realization, you might have 30 days, max 60 days.","On the contract side, on the fluff side, you really have a mix. You have a mix of regions where they're not indexed based; you have a mix of businesses, which are indexed based; and then even on the comp size based, sometimes they're very long before they're realized.","So between the time we announce and realization, there is a delay, I would say, no that was the dynamic we've had on different announcements, I'm quite positive we're going to start this quarter to see the impact significantly. So there is a delay. It varies with the product, it varies with the customers, the regions. But we are on a really good track. Two have been published by index already. We have two more prices, which we have seen action on the non-indexed contracts. So I'm quite confident we're going this way. So it takes time, but we're getting there.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thanks very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners","Yeah, hi, guys. This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. How are you?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Doing well. Good morning.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners","So first of all, just to continue on the fluff pulp. Can just you provide a little bit of color in your customer base, is it very concentrated? Is there a number for your top three or top five customer accounts that you can provide as a percentage of your sales?","Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.","I think we are \u2013 our mix is roughly like the market. So we have the top 10 customers in this market are important, it represents maybe 45% to 50%. Our top 10 must be 45% to 50%, and the other is 50% of our sales are many, many customers around the world. So we are more or less aligned with the market. I would say, the new mix we had will be a little bit more aligned with big customers and (31:33) so now the combination is roughly perfectly aligned with the market, even in terms of regional sales if you look at it. It's kind of almost to the percentage aligned with the market.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners","That makes a little sense. And just as a follow-up. Switching gears to the Ilim joint venture, we've noticed that you've been shifting the debt from U.S. dollars to rubles, and can you explain a little bit the rationale? Is it to smooth out your EPS? Or is there any other reason behind that shift?","Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.","Jean-Michel speaking again. We wanted to kind of naturally address Ilim, so we kind of had one third rubles, two-third \u2013 we're not trying to be all rubles or all U.S. dollars. As you know, we sell a lot in dollars, so the pulp is sold in dollars. So by adding a debt of this content that allows us to not depend so much about FX situation and be much more naturally hedged. So that was the reason we did it, and we don't have intention to make bigger the move.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just going back to slide 32 where you had the box shipments for the quarter. You noted the $22 of price\/mix per ton sequentially from the fourth quarter, obviously, you got some of the benefits of the $40 increase in the fourth quarter. Is there anything on the mix side of the business that's holding back some of the realization from that price increase?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah, we had a few dollars of negative mix just across segments in the first quarter relative to the fourth, roughly about $4 of \u2013 just in terms of customers and segments and the types of boxes that they buy.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Not structural?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","No, not structural, I mean, our mix just based on segments and how people buy fluctuates all the time. It can move positive or negatively a few dollars quarter-by-quarter.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I mean, is there a way to sort of characterize the type of product or customer that would cause those temporary mix issues?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","It's all over the map. It depends on board construction, it depends on box style. It just depends on a lot of factors. So in a word, no.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","We understand it. We look at it. We do a lot of detailed analysis about it, but there's nothing that kind of repeat itself over and over again. It just depends on demand across the segments.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then Mark, I thought I heard you mention earlier on the Consumer Packaging segment that you might have had some pre-buy, I think I heard that correctly. If so, where are you seeing that and sort of how should we think about the impact as move into the second quarter?","Catherine I. Slater - International Paper Co.","So this is Cathy Slater. Really, what we can say from the takeaway from our facilities that we saw higher shipping this quarter versus the same time last year.","And we know that we have outages and kind of all of our customers know that as well in the second quarter. And so really, we just continue to see the takeaway that occurred and we're really just speculating as to what our customers may have chosen to do to cover that.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Last one for me. Earlier this week RISI put out a notice that they're delaying the implementation of the recycled containerboard price index. And I think they're evaluating a more objective price index, which looks like it's across many different grades. How should we think about that? Or what are your thoughts on that so far as to what you're seeing?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Hi, it's Tim. I mean, we're waiting to see exactly what they're going to do. I think they're proposing that they run a pilot of some type. I mean, our view would be, no index is perfect but the one that we have has worked well over time.","There's moments of dislocation, probably up and down but on balance, we think it worked well over its history. I guess, we would want to understand what the changes are going to be and if objective means, a practice of submitting data, we would really be concerned about making sure it passes regulatory muster.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. All right, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hi guys. Pulp prices really have firmed up in the last few months across the spectrum globally. Just curious, how sustainable is that just given some of the passes (36:45) that's coming on later, but obviously, we appreciate the 5% growth that you're seeing in the market?","Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.","Hi. Jean-Michel speaking again. Like Tim, I cannot stipulate for the market, but if you look from our customer standpoint, the demand is very strong, and it's very strong not only in short-term. You know we have a long-term contract, so a lot of our sales are done three, six months in advance which forecast on our customers. And we're seeing a lot of growth.","One of the potential driver, and I'm sure it's not the only one, it's Asia, I think, there's a clear relation between consumer not the whole GDP, the specific consumer growth in Asia in terms of purchasing power, in terms of demand.","And this is impacting a lot of purchase of goods, which indirectly impact either SBSK or fluff because those are medical hygiene goods which we know they have a direct relation with the purchasing power. So I think there is a trend on developing countries, which are getting not only growth of economy, but growth of purchasing power people, which is creating an incremental demand.","So we think the demand more solid than we expected. So I'm recognizing that in some grade, not specifically fluff, in some grade there's going to be some new capacity coming. But if the demand continues to be as good and if some of the indicators we're seeing are continuing like they are, we're feeling good about it.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful. I guess, due to the weather in the West Coast, Ag was under pressure in the quarter for your Corrugated Packaging business. With things clearing up a bit, should we expect IP potentially outpacing the broader market since I believe you're more exposed to Ag versus some of your competitors and how should we think about mix from that type of the \u2013 from the Ag business?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah, I mean we're expecting a good quarter. Agriculture is an important segment for us. We are a bit disproportionately weighted to it. We did have a drag in the first quarter based on weather in terms of harvest and just timing on planting of row crops and whatnot. So we'll get a crop in the second quarter. I don't know how it'll compare to others, but we have a big exposure and we're expecting a big quarter.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just one last one for me, SBS actually soften a little bit in the fourth quarter, and we've seen a nice bounce back. Any concern that this is kind of inventory restock? And just curious, can you provide some color where you're seeing strength in SBS, any market, in particular? Thanks.","Catherine I. Slater - International Paper Co.","This is Cathy again, so just I guess, what I've said, where we're seeing strength is where we are good, which is in foodservice. And as Glenn already commented, as people are seeing improvement in wages and are on-the-go society where people are wanting to grab something quick and get a coffee, we're seeing some good strength there.","Overall though, I'd like say through this year, the backlogs have increased significantly whereas backlogs now that we haven't seen since 2014, so pretty good confidence about the strength of that price increase.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Good morning, Debbie.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I wanted to ask about how you feel that the overall kind of portfolio of businesses that you have today. I think in the past we've talked about some optionality around consumer in LatAm and potentially some of those might be at a bit of an inflection point here. So, I just was hoping you could comment overall and then specifically on those two units? And for lastly, I'm referring to corrugated.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hi, Debbie, it's Mark. Great question. We're always looking at ways to build the best International Paper we can. We described at a high-level, our strategic framework as building competitive advantage positions in attractive markets. And we believe we're making a lot of progress on them when you look at the businesses we have. The two you mentioned, they're still work in process. Cathy, just mentioned the part of Consumer that we're really, really competitive in, and we like integrated forward through foodservice converting, we're continuing to improve. And we're continuing to evaluate options for whether we can actually build and should build a competitive advantage position in the right markets in Consumer Packaging. And those types of evaluations take some time, but the core focus right now is improving what we have. And that's what we're doing.","On corrugated in Latin America, it's along the same lines. We look at our corrugated packaging business, and you've heard me say this before, somewhat globally as we think about containerboard and its channel to market, we want to understand all markets that we should and could be a value creating player. And so the standalone business we have in Latin America, we acquired it and sailed into the deepest recession Brazil has seen in modern history. And we have improved the business a lot, but with demand being negative, significantly negative tracking GDP, we haven't really seen the business perform in a more normalized market.","So, again, working on internal improvements and we'll assess it. I mean, Industrial Packaging and corrugated is core to the company, and we'd like to see what we can do in the major markets of the world. We've been in Brazil in paper. We know the country and the economy. We believe Brazil will improve. And in the first quarter, our box business in Brazil was up over 6% against the market at about 5%. So a lot of the work we've put into establishing the right relationships with the right customers is starting to pay off.","So we still believe that business has some potential inside of IP, but we are continuously looking at ways to improve the company and the value that we create. And all of our businesses and subparts of the businesses are part of that strategic evaluation and I think that's healthy for a company to do that.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up question, just switching gears a little bit. I won't ask a Trump question, but there have been some changes at the EPA. And I think in the past the industry, it felt like some of the regulation or evaluation was a bit too narrow. And I just wanted to get your sense because I know you follow things going on there, what changes or things that could happen under the new administration that could be beneficial or maybe potentially worse for the industry kind of as we sit here today?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","I think our view, Debbie, on regulatory issues is that's not the primary issue for a company like International Paper, it definitely matters. But the biggest issue that we try to work on and that we see benefit is things that can improve the economy, which then improves demand for our products, but specifically for things like regulatory issues. The number one issue that we've been working on as International Paper is really the way that we construct our business model where we take renewable national resources and we convert them into products that are consumer-oriented products.","In doing that, we generate 75% of our own energy from carbon-neutral biomass, and that is a tremendously powerful business model. And the work we've been doing with the EPA, both legislatively and directly with the agency for a while is to have a clear outcome on the recognition that wood-based biomass energy is carbon-neutral. So whatever we do in the future as a nation on carbon, we're recognized for the role we're playing, which is a powerful business model. It helps the overall balance, fossil fuel and non-fossil fuel. So that's the key issue that every time I'm in Washington and talking about regulatory issues with the EPA and anyone else, that's the issue that we talk about from our company and from our industry standpoint.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. I will turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Chercover of Davidson.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Good morning.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","So I had a quick question on your OCC forecast, which is flat versus Q1. One of your peers suggested that Q2 average would be higher. So I'm wondering if you expect prices to decline or maybe you're just better at procurement?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Or what we had in inventory, right, as you consume it. So, I mean, we're up slightly. We stay flat, it's within a few dollars on average quarter-to-quarter. We see it pretty stable right now. So I don't expect any dramatic changes, no.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","But Steve, we are good at procurement as every...Thank you for that.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Sure. And \u2013 well, Jean-Michel just answered one of my questions on pulp, so the other one is kind of just I suppose easy. The Madrid start up is one of your, I guess, benefits for a very strong second half. And I'm just wondering, are there start-up costs that are incorporated and still going to be accretive?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","I think the best way, Steve, to think about Madrid is it's happening in the fourth quarter in terms of the conversion from newsprint to actually making and integrating in containerboard. It's a catalyst for 2018. The biggest drivers for the second half of 2017 are the ones we've pointed out in our remarks, around the core businesses, and the pricing, and the internal initiatives and the fact that 75% of our outages will be behind us after the second quarter. But we'll see a benefit in the quarter \u2013 in the fourth quarter for that conversion, and then it will really help the European packaging business for the full year of 2018.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Mark.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Good morning. How are you?","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good. Listen, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about kind of supply-demand in the domestic uncoated freesheet business. I mean we're running at about 90% operating rate, demand is easing. How do you see this kind of playing out?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","I think at a strategic level, we see the end-use demand drivers as continuing along the recent track, so that's in that kind of minus 3-ish, minus 3% to 5% depending on what your exposure is to roll-based products versus cut size. We're actually continuing to have for a while doing a little bit better than that. And it has to do just with the customer alignment and the mix of products.","International Paper still believes in the value of branded products in some of those end-use markets, especially cut size and we still see a benefit from that as our customers \u2013 in the way they present their total package to the market, probably the brands help them play a differentiated role. And we obviously tried, as everyone does, to align ourselves up with the winning customers. So all that net-net in a market that's declined I think in the first quarter about 4%, we're down about half of that.","So I don't see any major changes. I think it puts a premium on commercial excellence, supply chain performance, and in our case, we still believe in brands. We've lowered our cost structure enough to be competitive in certain markets for certain products in exports, so we have a few \u2013 a little bit more export than we had before. And again, I think that's something that we like the footprint we have and the assets, we're down to just a few mills, they're excellent at what they do and our commercial teams are top class.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And just to kind of tie that together with the containerboard business where we've got a high operating rate, we've been running kind of 96%, 97%. There's really not much capacity in the pipeline here in North America. I just wondered, is there a point here where you might think about sort of a conversion at some place like Eastover or down in Selma similar to what happened down in Pensacola?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So Mark, that's a great question. And I've said this publicly in the past that when I think about what we have in terms of our assets and our workforce, we have the ability in a number of our facilities to make a different product tomorrow than we make today, primarily because of the workforce quality and the asset configuration and access to fiber.","So yes, there are a couple of our uncoated freesheet operations that in the future could be candidates to make other products and obviously, packaging would be an obvious one. But we'd do only do that if that help to improve our business and create a significant value.","And I talked about our Printing Papers business as being well managed and adding that business, lacking a real better option gives us optionality on a number of fronts. So we think about it all the time, and we think about the value of kraftliner long term and whether the world and our customers need more kraftliner, IP very well positioned uniquely in some ways to be able to act on that if necessary.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then last one I had, is it possible to talk about sort of what two or three kind of main fixes would be down at Orsa?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","I'll talk about one, plus 4% GDP versus minus 4%.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","And then two, we've got a partially integrated system with kraftliner and recycled liner and really figuring out the mill side of that business. We don't have the best-in-class assets on the paper side. So creating a more \u2013 or deciding a different business model, for example. And then I think, third would be to continue, and we're making a lot of progress on this one, continue to restructure the customer portfolio in the segment.","We were, in some ways, playing in places that we weren't competitively advantaged and the reason we're doing better than the market right now is because we decided to try to serve people with better advantage than.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Mark. Good luck in the second quarter and than in that second half.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman of Roe Equity Research.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Hey, good morning.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hi, Gail.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Tim, I guess, the 1.5% to 2% box volume growth is up a little bit than I think what you mentioned in the last few calls. I'm just wondering if you can give \u2013 if there's any specific part of the market that's kind of driving that confidence? Any color there?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. I mean, the way we model it, we don't model it out segment-by-segment. We obviously know which ones have been performing better over time, like e-commerce and distribution, and protein and we expect Ag will come back.","So the way we model the market on an annual basis has a variety of factors. Nondurable goods production is only one of them, we think there's other things that drive demand. And we finished stronger in the fourth quarter last year and when we reran the numbers based on economic projections across different segments of the economy, it's looking like 2017 is going to be stronger by a fair amount than 2016 was.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. Switching gear, the Ilim dividend was obviously a lot larger than what you even expected on the last earnings conference call, a lot larger than what you've received over the last few years. I'm just wondering if you can give some insight. Do you think this level is sustainable? Is there any kind of pending major claim on cash at Ilim in terms of projects that might be coming up?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Gail, the Ilim dividend of more than $100 million, is in the range that we talked about seeing the potential of this being $100 million a year dividend and it's starting to come to fruition. There is a strategic plan for llim and our view of Ilim is, there's tremendous potential with that business. And over some period of time, along with our partners in Russia, is looking at building out the full potential of that business in two kind of the ways. One is for domestic and regional markets, and then the other is as Jean-Michel mentioned earlier, serving the softwood fiber needs of the greater Asian market, namely China. So there is more potential in that business. It's not out of runway. But the dividend generation that you saw in this particular payout is very sustainable, and we expected it to get to this level and we are generating the kind of EBITDA and performance that should allow this dividend to remain strong.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Armstrong of Armstrong Investments.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hi, James.","Unknown Speaker","The first one I have is actually about inventories in the containerboard. You mentioned that they are pretty low. Do you see any risk of inventories becoming too tight during the maintenance season?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","I speak for us, I mean, yeah, we scrambled in the first quarter and we're going to continue to work pretty hard in the second quarter, even with Pensacola back up, the supply chain is pretty long, especially if you think about export. And as I mentioned, we've seen good demand from basically all regions for our export business. So we've got a large flexible system that when we run it well, we run it really well. But we're recovering from, as I said, record low levels of inventory in the first quarter. But we manage a pretty tight system all the time. We saw our inventories go down last year, just because of supply chain effects and logistics being easier to manage. So we stay close to it all the time, and we try to make sure that quarter-by-quarter, month-by-month, we're balancing appropriately to our demand signal and what we see in all three channels that we serve.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","James, if I could add to Tim's point, and the absolute inventory numbers are very visible and very important in our industry. But it's really important the point Tim made about the inventory against the backdrop of transportation network. Sometimes, it takes more inventory because of the supply-demand balance and transportation to perform in the same way that you could perform in a lot lower inventory with huge velocity improvements which, Tim mentioned, we saw at some point last year in the trucking industry. So it really is inventory against the relative environment on transportation. And that whole analysis is what our supply chain tech systems and our IT systems monitor so we can confidently take our inventories to levels that look really, really low in a particular period of time, but may be against a really efficient transportation network.","And I would imagine that that's going to continue to be a challenge. And if the economy improves, which we would love to see happen, it's going to put some early stress on transportation and our supply chain team will respond accordingly with customer service and building the right margin structure as the number one objective.","Unknown Speaker","That's exactly what I was looking for. Switching gears a little. I know this is an impossible question, but what are you seeing in terms of China and OCC? Did do you see any inventory build as prices ran up? And do you think the \u2013 they're going to stay out of the market for an extended period of time?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Well, I have no way of knowing what they'll do because I can't read minds, but it seems like it stabilized. This new program of National Sword that's going to ramp up in June, I think, will likely cause some volatility. We don't think it's targeted toward OCC as pure OCC grade. We do think that it could have an impact on mix paper, even though we think it'll be broader than that and then also pick up plastics and whatnot. But I see OCC pretty stable as we said in the second quarter. And I think it's going to be elevated for the whole year the way it's looking right now.","Unknown Speaker","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from Paul Quinn of International Paper (sic) [RBC].","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Welcome to the company, Paul.","Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","When should I expect my first check. Thanks for taking the call, and sorry, but we'll see whether you've asked this question, or whether you've been asked this question before, but we got three conference calls at the same time, I've only got two ears here. So the question was around pulp and I see \u2013 so what I'm looking for is a comment on realizations, a comment on volume, and a comment on your Ilim forecast. So when I look at Global Cellulose Fibers, that price mix was down $27 a ton quarter-over-quarter, but Ilim's price mix was up $22, just wondering why one is lagging when one is pro?","And then when I look at the Ilim volumes, they were down 24% quarter-over-quarter which was huge and just wondering what you're expecting in Q2? And then just on the Ilim forecast, you did $50 million in Q1, you're forecasting $40 million, but with the price increases, it looks like $40 million would be an easy layup. So I'm just wondering if you've got a lot of maintenance at Ilim in Q2? Thanks.","Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.","So let me take the first one I think on the pricing. The pricing we show is really a mix of region, products. So sometimes, the comparison from one quarter to another is a little bit difficult. So we'll say you have a greater mix of (1:00:12) in the first Q than we normally have due to the outages. So because of all these outages, we could not sell the \u2013 we sold more than last year, but not much as we wanted to. So I think it impacted prices in the midsized.","Then you have contracts which are negotiated kind of in 2016 which took effect beginning of 2017 before the announcement of the price increase, so I think those impacted to the Q1 prices. So that was, I would say, mostly temporary. If the markets have not gone up, it could have stayed like this but with the price announcement we've made and the realization we're seeing, you see our prices gone back to what they were and even above that.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Relative to the volume side of the equation, this is Glenn and I think I said earlier, clearly, the first quarter for Ilim is seasonally slow. And it was impacted by that significantly. We did have a big FX gain that helped buffer that exposure in the first quarter. It will improve seasonally in the second quarter. In the second quarter we had even higher outages, which then offset some of that. So that basically ties out the month-to-month \u2013 the quarter-to-quarter view on volume.","Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks very much. Best of luck guys.","Operator","Your final question comes from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I think you called out earlier a little bit of a less favorable mix in consumer. I just wondered if I could get a little bit more color on what was driving that and what the outlook is for mix there?","Catherine I. Slater - International Paper Co.","Okay. Well, looking at \u2013 this is Cathy Slater, hello. So in the mix, the comparison that we have of what we saw as a bit of a hurt was that we had lower aseptic volume, but we do have a lot stronger slate and cut volume that we're seeing, and that's where we feel good. So that's really what the differences are there.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And just one last one. Just any thoughts on cash contribution to the pension through the year? And just kind of thoughts on the trade-off of whether you want to make any contributions?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah. It's a good question. This is Glenn speaking. Obviously, as we stated earlier, given the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser and the leveraged up condition of our balance sheet, clearly, this year is about debt reduction. And we put the pension in that bucket. So we'll look at our options relative to reducing debt directly or contributing to the pension and make a decision along the way which one is optimal for us this year. So it's definitely in line of sight.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's conference.

My name is Sarah and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2017 International Paper Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Mr. Jay Royalty, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.","Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2017 earnings press release and today's presentation slides.","Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thank you, Jay, and I had my thanks to everyone calling in for our call. We appreciate your interest in International Paper. Starting off on slide 5, the transitional quarter that I spoke about on the last call came in as we expected. International Paper delivered solid results overall, driven by Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers. In our Industrial Packaging business, favorable market conditions and healthy demand underpinned the solid quarter. Results in Global Cellulose Fibers were driven by strong global demand along with record fluff pulp sales, favorable pricing trends and synergies which are being realized in a faster rate than originally conveyed. The recent price increases are coming in as we expected with most of the benefits coming in the second half of the year.","OCC with the greater headwind than we had originally expected, driven by stronger global demand. We successfully executed our heavy maintenance outage schedule in the second quarter and as we sit here today about 75% of our planned maintenance outages were completed in the first half of the year. The Ilim joint venture delivered another strong quarter of operational EBITDA. However, IP's equity earnings were negatively impacted by a non-cash FX charge related to this joint venture's U.S. dollar denominated net debt. All in all, we finished the second quarter as we expected and we're well positioned for a very strong second half.","On slide 6 and continuing with the financials, I would like to point out a couple of key metrics. First, year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter was 9%. This was driven by the pulp acquisition, overall volume growth in our businesses and increased pricing in several of our businesses. You can also see the negative $0.04 impact of ruble that I mentioned earlier in the quarter.","With that, I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss each of our business segment's results and our outlook. Glenn?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yes. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 7, which is the overall enterprise bridge from the first quarter to the second quarter. So starting from the left to right, price improvement in the quarter was significant, driven by North American Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers. Volume was seasonally stronger as expected. Operations and other costs improved quarter-over-quarter and maintenance outage expenses were significantly higher again as we planned. Input costs in aggregate were a modest headwind as higher OCC up $24 million quarter-over-quarter were largely offset by lower wood, chemicals and energy costs. Corporate expenses were lower and the effective tax rate was more favorable due to the benefit of the catch up of a state tax rate change.","And lastly, as Mark already noted, earnings contribution from the Ilim JV were a headwind this past quarter, this was driven by a non-cash FX charge on their U.S. denominated debt although somewhat offset by solid operations.","Now, turning to the businesses and beginning with Industrial Packaging, earnings were higher driven by seasonally stronger as well as higher underlying demand along with improving prices in North American domestic and export containerboard markets, and of course North American box. As these price increases continue to ramp up, we will see the majority of the benefits hit in the second half of 2017. Operations and other cost improved but were negatively impacted by cost associated with Tropical Storm Cindy, a few isolated reliability events in the quarter and higher LIFO inventory reevaluation charges primarily related to increasing prices.","I would also note that IP receives $13 million in insurance proceeds related to the Pensacola incident in the quarter, which is roughly the same as those received in the prior quarters. Input costs in the second quarter were higher, driven by OCC that was up roughly $20 per ton on average quarter-over-quarter. And lastly, closing up the first half, we successfully executed our heaviest planned maintenance quarters with nearly 70% of our maintenance outages behind us for the year.","So moving to slide 9 and taking a look at our history in North America and the portion of our Industrial Packaging business, we are entering a period of significant market expansion in the second half of this year as our price and cost initiatives continue to be realized. The takeaway here is simple, this is a business that's resilient and able to relatively consistently deliver value across a broad range of economic conditions. The key drivers of this large improvement in the second half includes good growth, driven by both domestic and export demand, increasing prices in North America and also on exports, lower maintenance outages especially in this period and ongoing cost reduction initiative. So with that said, we are returning to peak historical margins in the face of higher input costs, which point to a healthy and growing global market environment and ultimately sets us up for an excellent run rate going into 2018.","Turning to slide 10, I'd also want to take a moment to highlight the current state of our kraft linerboard exports from North America. As we talked about often, our export channels for kraft linerboard out of the US network are strategic for IP and provide us with many options to fully capture the value of our total containerboard system.","Drawing your attention to the chart, we predominantly serve the globe's kraft linerboard needs in three regions; Latin America, Southern Europe and Asia. As you can see, global demand growth for kraftliner continues to be robust in 2017, up 3% to 4%. Further pricing trends have been favorable in all the regions and we expect that momentum to continue, which is another key driver enabling us to restore margins into the mid-20% level.","Moving to slide 11, I wanted to briefly highlight an attractive acquisition that we recently closed in Morroco. We purchased Europac's Tangier facility, which was only recently started up in 2016, so quite modern facility. With this acquisition, IP received a very solid set of assets and an attractive portfolio of customers that are a great complement to IP's existing EMEA packaging business and customer base. This acquisition allows for significant optimization and growth opportunities and again, underlines our commitment to the region. I can share that we are off to a great start in the first month of ownership.","Now turning to Global Cellulose Fibers, lots of green on this chart, coming off a transitional quarter in Q1, the business turned in very solid performance across the board. Earnings improved by $63 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased prices, improved mix, solid operational performance, and greater synergy benefits. The business saw a record fluff pulp volume and continue to grow within the Specialty Products segment. All in, with consideration of a light outage month in June, we exited the second quarter with EBITDA margins north of 20%.","Going a bit deeper on synergies on slide 13, we delivered $34 million of synergies to the bottom line in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $48 million and approaching quickly our full-year target for 2017. Further, we exited the second quarter at an annualized rate of $126 million, well ahead of our full-year run rate target of $100 million. This gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to meet and ultimately beat the original $175 million synergy target and get there more quickly than we originally thought. This alone is really another key driver to our year-over-year improvement.","On slide 14, moving to Printing Papers, financial results came in largely as expected as earnings were modestly lower due to heavy planned maintenance outages which were partially offset by higher volume out of Brazil mostly export and Europe.","Slightly lower pricing and less favorable mix in North America was also largely offset by the increased prices in Europe. Turning to slide 15 and the Consumer Packaging business, results were significantly lower in the second quarter, much of which was driven by a significant planned outage expense of about $30 million predominantly at our Augusta Georgia Mill.","As is typical to our initial inspections at the start of any outage, we identified at Augusta incremental opportunities for maintenance and we made the decision to extend the outages to perform additional work on the boiler. Coming out of the outage, we also incurred more costs associated with the start-up. But these events are behind us, and we expect normal operations from this point forward.","Commercially, results in the quarter were solid. Pricing improved as implementation of the recent price increases continued, and we continue to see the underlying drivers of demand improve as we experience increased backlog, although much of this upside was delayed in the quarter by production constraints at Augusta.","So, now on page 16, moving to Ilim, the JV delivered a very solid quarter of results, driven by seasonally higher volume and improved pulp pricing. However, as we've said a couple of times already, the equity earnings were negatively impacted by a non-cash balance sheet charge related to FX, as I discussed earlier.","Looking ahead, the JV expects seasonally lower volume and lower average pulp prices to impact earnings for the third quarter. Equity earnings are projected to be $35 million assuming no change in FX from the second quarter equity raise.","We're now on page 17 which is our third quarter outlook. Turning to it, we expect to see significant benefits associated with the execution of the March $50 per ton North America containerboard and box price increases, along with continued price realization on North America containerboard exports, as well as benefits from ongoing implementation of price increases in Consumer Packaging.","With all combined, should improve earnings by about $80 million quarter-over-quarter. And additionally in the price\/mix section, continued benefits from the pulp price increases, partially offset by seasonality and the recent dip in softwood pulp prices, will drive a net benefit to our Global Cellulose Fiber business of roughly $10 million. And in North American Papers where demand is softer, mix is expected to be a modest headwind due to a higher percentage of export shipments.","Moving to volume, while we expect demand to stay strong for boxes, we will be unfavorably impacted by one less shipping day. In terms of operational performance and costs, we expected Industrial Packaging to improve $40 million quarter-over-quarter. This is due to lower operating costs and lower LIFO charges. Operational costs are expected to be lower in Consumer Packaging as well as we pass the impact from the extended outage in Augusta, and that's now behind us. So, net-net, this represents an improvement in earnings in Consumer of about $10 million.","As we discussed earlier, outage expenses are scheduled to be lower by $165 million across the enterprise while input costs, driven primarily by OCC and energy, are expected to be higher by about $25 million. In the Other Items category, we have provided our assumptions for corporate expense, interest expenses, tax rate and equity earnings from the Ilim JV.","So, now let me turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Glenn. You've all heard and talk about the strong second half that we envisioned in front of us, and as we sit here today, it's now upon us. International Paper is positioned for margin expansion over the balance of the year, which also should set us up very nicely as we move into 2018.","There are several drivers of this step change in results, a healthy demand outlook, particularly for our Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers businesses, the realization of recent price increases across many of our IP businesses, solid operational performance and cost reduction initiatives, coupled with significantly lower maintenance outage expenses, and finally commercial and synergy momentum in our Global Cellulose Fibers business.","As we've been saying since the recent pulp acquisition, we will continue to allocate capital to create value, and in the near term debt reduction is our priority. Putting all this together, I continue to be highly confident in our full-year view of delivering year-over-year EBITDA growth with upside to the 10% target I shared earlier this year.","With that, we'll open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","First question, any sense \u2013 in July, first part of July how business is looking? We just heard from a competitor of yours who seems to have had a very strong start to July. Are you seeing similar trend?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Mark, I would assume \u2013 is there a particular business? I'd assume you're talking about the box market, but I don't want to ...","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Exactly, yes.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So, yeah, I'll let Tim just talk about July but I think that our story is similar. Tim?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Hey, Mark. We are seeing a strong start to July for our box system. As of today, our cut-up's running 5-plus percent year-over-year and we're also seeing strong demand continue in the export markets as well. So, it feels like it's pretty robust at the moment.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And just any thoughts, any color \u2013 I mean, it just really seems to be just such a fast pace, but certainly the price increases should be in now, so you wouldn't think there's any inventory building going on. What do you think is behind what really just seems to be an exceptionally fast pace?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","You know it feels pretty broad-based to us. We're getting some help on the West Coast in terms of our agricultural position in the first quarter. Some crops that normally start coming in in March got pushed out into the second quarter and even some in the second quarter are being pushed into the third. So, we're seeing heavy ag shipments this month and we expect it again in August.","But, that being said, we're seeing pickup in industrial accounts as well. So, it feels pretty broad-based. In terms of price, you were talking about it. I mean, we don't have any sense that our customers are building inventory, probably have no way to know that full stop but it's kind of hard to build inventory and hold inventory for box customers. They typically \u2013 manufacturers just don't have the space. Our price increase you referenced, it's going extremely well. We're right on top of what the expectation was and we've got a lot of flow-through coming in the third quarter.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And then just one last quick one. You'd mentioned you expect to see the full or pretty much all the benefit in the second half of 2017 on that price increase. Should I take that to mean that some of it will be showing up in the fourth quarter or does it really almost all show up by the third quarter?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Almost all of it in the third quarter. We'll be 90-plus percent through the third quarter and there's a little bit of residual that flows through into fourth quarter but not a whole lot.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just with the strong volumes you're reporting in the number you just gave for July, just wondering how the system is operating on an operating rate basis? And are there any debottleneck or expansion opportunities that you might be looking a green light or might be getting a second look, given the accelerated pace of demand we're seeing?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. A great question. We're thankful that 2 years ago we embarked on adding capacity and flexibility in our system where we needed to. We're continuing to execute against that, we've only brought on about half at this point. We've got another increment that will come on in the third quarter, and then the last one will be completed next year. So, we still have the opportunities that we referenced back in 2015 that are coming online, as well as debottlenecking opportunities across our mill system. We've got a pretty broad and flexible system with a lot of capability. And so, we continue to evaluate additional opportunities there.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Brian, this is Mark. Just to add to Tim's comment the other flexibility we have in our system is International Paper serves all the major channels for kraftliner, so the U.S. domestic market, and our own box plant, the open market and the export market and our ability to move our production to where our demand signal is the strongest and our margins at the highest, gives us very flexible system including where capacity is deployed at different point in time.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And Tim, would you characterize those expansions as adding maybe 1% to your capacity every year or something a little bit lower than that?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","A little bit lower but that's in the order of magnitude.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. And just one last one from me, the consumer volume is a little bit light I take it that, that had to do with the extended maintenance outage. But, overall (18:52) seem like they've been pretty healthy for the industry and the backlogs have improved. Just wondering, if you could comment on what you're seeing in the market there. And any thoughts on the strategic importance of that asset to the company?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So, Brian, your take on the market is accurate. The demand has been pretty solid. Our issues of just making the product during that month with such a large asset out for such a long period of time; it's really an issue with our volume. We have seen a pick up, we convert, as you know, a percentage of our boards to make cups and fruit containers that business is doing very well. And our customers in the open market in different segments has shown some strength.","We've said a number of times the Consumer Packaging business, while it's small relative to other parts of our company, it's a business and a market that we like. We think there are some synergies with other things we do. We've been working to figure out what the right role for International Paper is. When we talk about strategy and IT, we talk about building advantaged position it's an attractive market.","And at any point in time, you can take a snapshot and not every part of your company meets that test. And our question that we have to answer is, is there a way to get to the advantaged position standpoint and that's what we're looking at and evaluating.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hi. I think, Glenn you mentioned earlier you're getting back to peak margins in the containerboard, in light of peak OCCs prices. But, it seems like there's a new paradigm in an issue whether it's demand, obviously limited supply and the steepening cost curve. So, bigger picture and longer term, what's the opportunity set for further margin expansion in medium term, like what do you think the next peak could be?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Well, I think we speak to that broadly. While referring to the second half and the second half notably has low outages so there's an annualized impact of outages that we need to apply there. But, we're going to see that margin expansion and we're going flirt with if not beat our last peak. And so we're not considering it a maximum peak by any means.","The three components that are going to drive margin and EBITDA growth in the company are growth, volume and our ability to meet that volume. The reality of a steepening cost curve in a high OCC environment and the fact that we have a lot of cost savings opportunities in this big network that Tim spoke to across our system, and combine those, we see that 3% or 5% EBITDA growth over time","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","The other thing that I would add to Glenn's comments since I agree with it of course is looking at export markets. Over the last period of time as export pricing was under pressure, we lost rough order $200 million of value just through selling price decreases and that's starting to come back. So, this year, we think we'll recapture half of that. And on a run rate basis going out to the year, we should be close to whole.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. And I guess for the synergy ramp for your Weyerhaeuser has been really impressive. Is that driven by this really good execution on your front or you're just finding more opportunities and I guess longer term, could you see upside to your long term synergy target for Weyerhaeuser?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Philip, I'm going to attempt to have Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras answer that question. He's in Asia right now with Cellulose Fiber customers, but we'll give it a shot. And if it doesn't work, I'll come back and answer it. Jean-Michel?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Yes. Good morning. I hope you can hear me fine. I would say the synergies are kind of have been better than we expected everywhere. We had a lot of customers in fact which were not overlapping much more than we originally thought and with our Riegelwood 18 new capacity for example, we had a much faster ramp up than we expected. Then on the supply chain, logistics, scoping it really went well. So, if you look at our numbers today, we are already at $48 million year-to-date. Our target was $60 million for the year which we clearly \u2013 we are going to beat that target. Our current run rate is about, we think end of the year $126 million. So, we feel very comfortable about the $175 million target and actually much faster than we had original planned. So, we're discovering much more opportunities than we already thought.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just one more question on that, Cellulose Fiber segment. I guess even (23:52) for that matter, pricing in softwood appears to have kind of peaked, I understand part of that's seasonality. But, there is some capacity that's coming on in the medium term, as well as the market is absorbing some of that new fluff capacity that's being qualified at this point.","Just, what's your view in the next 12 months to 18 months on softwood and fluff pulp prices and that correlation dynamic? And any color on how you're thinking about rebates going forward? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Thank you. Quite different I would say on softwood or fluff, I would say, there are some new capacities which are ramping up which are going to come up, which will impact for 6 months to 12 months, maybe the global operating rate in softwood. In fluff, with the growth we're having with the market demand which is kind of clearly stronger than we expected. I am less worried. I don't think we're going to be on an extremely tight market for 12 months to 18 months. But, I think that between the good growth of the market and the ramp up, which you know is always longer than many times people think in fluff. It really takes time to get qualified to ramp up. I think fluff is going to continue to be quite well balanced for this coming 12 -months to 18-months and probably after.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","And on the rebate, I'm sorry.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Oh, yeah.","Operator","And your next question...","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","I believe that's your question?","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, rebate.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","I'm sorry. I think we have to be careful this year so there is a big difference between market pulp and fluff. So, I would say the trend on the last year has been an increase in the rebate, there is no doubt. But, in fluff, we really don't sell the same way we market fluff. Almost every customer has a different contract size, some are (26:10). So, it's very difficult to mix both of them. I would not do that. If I need to explain on rebate, I would be happy to.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Merrill Lynch.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Jean-Michel, good evening. I just want to maybe piggyback on the fluff and cellulose fiber questions. Recognizing that you might not want to get into a mark-to-market exercise, given that the synergies are coming quicker than you thought, and congratulations to you on that, when do you think you'll be in a position to maybe update whether the $175 million is the right number or maybe they could wind up being higher given the progress that you're seeing?","And you enumerated a number of places where you've been getting more progress on CF synergies. Is there one or two that in particular was beneficial to you in terms of the progress so far? And then I had a couple of follow-ons.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Glenn, why don't you take the first part?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah. So, just on a macro basis, George \u2013 this is Glenn. I think it's preliminary right now. We're seeing, more than anything else, the rate of improvement cutting on fast. While we have expectations and it looks good relative \u2013 like I said earlier relative to the opportunities to do better; we're not in a position today \u2013 we're not in a position today to really speak to the rate which is again the underlining point of the quarter. But, we should be ready as we get closer to the end of the year.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that, Glenn. A couple of questions on paperboard broadly. I just wanted to confirm, so aside from it sounded like there was maybe $5 million of additional outage expense within Consumer. The performance in the segment was pretty much where you had expected it. Would that be fair?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah. That's definitely fair. Speaking on behalf of the businesses, this is Glenn. We had strong demand. We had operational issues and had a big outage in the quarter that certainly set us back and then also put a tap on our volume, as our backlog expanded, we ultimately have delayed some of that into the next quarter. So net-net, we're comfortable with the market backdrop that was really the assignable cause of this.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And you'd mentioned some \u2013 I forgot how you said it. But, it sounded like there's some operating issues minor, but nonetheless some issues in the containerboard system in the quarter. Can you comment to what those were and if there's been any carry over? And piggybacking, I think on a question that Brian had asked earlier, the capacity expansions and really is more \u2013 mill system optimization flexibility that you're building in. If memory serves, it was about 250,000 tons and if I heard you correctly, you've gotten half of it now, you'll get half of it next year and there are incremental benefits you'd expect to get and if you could put some sort of number on that incremental that would be helpful.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Hi, George, it's Tim.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, Tim.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","We've gotten half of it. We've got more coming on in the third quarter of this year. And then so we'll be at about 70% implemented by the end of the year and the balance will come on next year.","And then the operational issues that you referenced earlier, almost all of them were related to weather. We had Cindy, Tropical Storm Cindy that came through and knocked some of the mills down. But then we just had \u2013 towards the end of the quarter, we had some significant thunderstorm activity and weather comes through taking the utilities down which blacked a number of our mills, and then we had to scramble to get them back up. I think it's behind us. But they were pretty much all situational.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. My last question, can you comment a little bit about how Europe is going, specifically Madrid? And then before turning it over, just want to say thanks again, Jay, for all your great work in IR. We really appreciate it working with you and, Guillermo, welcome aboard. Thanks.","Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.","Thanks, George.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","George, this is Mark. On Europe, we're right on plan for the Madrid conversion. So the equipment is all spec'd, ordered and showing up and we're ready with the team to phase out the newsprint manufacturing and convert to containerboard. We've got some exciting new technology that will go into that conversion, making it really, really high performance board. And as we showed on that slide with the small box plant acquisition in Morocco and looking at Spain and Morocco and the food basket there that uses kraftliner and high-performance recycled, it's a perfect example of building an advantage position in a really attractive market. So we're excited about the conversion and ready to get on with making containerboard and everything is right on target.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","When are you producing first commercial ton, Mark?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So the first commercial ton, we should be in December...","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","...of this year. I hesitated, because I was thinking about when we would have kind of a reasonable ramp. It's going to be through December. Our target was always getting it converted in the fourth quarter and having it fully ramped into our system as we enter 2018.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you so much.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, George.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Good morning. Hey, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I wondered if we could kind of just jumping back to containerboard and containerboard capacity, I'm kind of reminded of that old Dr. John song about it. I don't do it, somebody else will. With the industry running at 97% right now, just it seems like the market is getting a signal that we need more capital in the business or we need more capacity in the business. Can you talk about sort of beyond that 2018 debottlenecking, what else you guys are looking at or might think about to bring on additional capacity?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Hey, Mark. It's Tim. Yeah, I mean, we look at a number of things in terms of how we create value in this business. And certainly, given market conditions and the growth that we see in both boxes and in board, growing with market is a significant component of our value creation strategy.","Mark's talked in the past about the breadth of capability across International Paper. We've got a great organization. We've got great assets with a lot of flexibility. So, we constantly evaluate how to deploy those assets and when to deploy them for the greatest value creation. So there's opportunities there. Not ready to speak about anything specifically, but we do have opportunities.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So just to kind of follow that a little further along though, Tim, can you say just generally right now, does it look like the better opportunity is kind of incremental debottleneck at existing mills or it might involve kind of conversions which you guys have talked about in the past.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","We've got multiple opportunities, Mark. I wouldn't want to single any one out, but I think we've got multiple opportunities.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then, Tim, just one short follow- on, I just wonder if you can talk at all about what you might be doing to kind of help mitigate risk of another Kleen Products settlement?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Great question. One of the things that we do is we have a very robust pricing mechanism and pricing governance protocol within Industrial Packaging. So on a regular basis, every month, we are updating the macro factors, the metrics that we look at and evaluating how we feel about our pricing posture and that is there's a lot of analytics involved, and there's a lot of discussion and we do it religiously every month no matter what.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then, Tim, also just on Brazil, can you give us some sense of what you saw in your box business in Brazil in the second quarter?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Generally, improvement across the board. Not as much as we would like, but we did get pricing improvement, our operations ran better. Volume was better, but not as good as it could have been given some of the segment issues down there around protein and then the just general market conditions. But on balance, I think we're performing better in the market, and certainly from pricing and volume, commercial excellence, the team is doing a better job down there.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then, Glenn, I think you guys mentioned that $13 million insurance recovery on Pensacola in the second quarter. Can you help us understand sort of what other impacts from Pensacola we might have seen in the second quarter?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yes. Yes, I can, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just give us kind of bridging first quarter to second quarter, so we understand sort of how Pensacola kind of played into second quarter results.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Sure. So the net earnings impact was just $3 million in the quarter, Mark. The $13 million was the insurance recovery, but we had continued business interruption, this is more on the supply chain area moving through the quarter. So that was really how it affected the second quarter.","If I put the whole thing in perspective, the impact we looked at for the whole year is around $63 million, $50 million of that is business interruption, the other $13 million is capital investments. We expect to recover on the earnings line $46 million of that $50 million. Insurance recovery to-date is $25 million. So the net earnings impact is miniscule, and the cash impact is at best basically the size of the deductible.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Right. That's fine. And finally, Mark Sutton, can you just update us on kind of thoughts around Ilim both in terms of IP's ownership stake there, but also I think you've got some potential expansion opportunities at Ilim, and I just wondered where those sit right now?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Sure, Mark. As we said before, we think Ilim is a powerful example of building an advantage position in a number of businesses, serving really attractive markets. So the pulp side of Ilim is really all about the Chinese and Asian softwood market. We just came off of a big capacity expansion, and we're ramping that up and getting it into the hands of the right customers in the right segments. There are more opportunities longer term in the future. We would time that when and if the market needed it in the targeted segments we have. But the opportunity is there and the advantage of fiber and logistics are just really, really compelling. The balance of Ilim is really an International Paper microcosm. We make containerboards in the Ilim business and we're working to expand that today as we speak. We also make boxes in Russia with our partners in Ilim and we make some uncoated free sheet and some other forest products.","And so, those businesses are growing, serving the local market and certainly some of the markets in Eastern Europe. It's a 50\/50 joint venture, right now. We really believe it's best to operate in Russia with partners. We have great partners today that are not just generic business people, they are forest industry professional that have been in the industry their whole life. And they're educated in forestry and sustainability. So the common view on how one should run a forest products company from a renewable natural resource all the way through (38:41) carbon-neutral energy generation to recoverable and recyclable products matches the IP value proposition perfectly.","So ownership stakes will be discussed over time when it makes sense, but what we do like is we like the business and we like our partners and we like the potential that that business has. Under normal CapEx, inside of the normal scheme of things, we're de-bottlenecking, we're improving capacity. We're looking at things together in the industrial packaging market and that's all going very, very well and you'll continue to see a really powerful EBITDA generation out of that business.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, fair enough. Thanks and good luck in second half.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. I just wanted to follow up with couple of questions regarding the fluff business. So as we think about the path to \u2013 you guys have talked about longer term getting this to a $600-ish million of EBITDA business. A couple elements that will improve things, I think, 2018 versus 2017, so if you kind of help me with the size or scale or buckets of these. I mean, one is going to be your synergy stuff, which you're telling us you're ahead of and have identified new things.","The second is, it was earlier you talked about some of the rebates or discounts and I guess, my question here is most of your contracts are \u2013 those only get addressed when the contracts get renewed, meaning, if there are 3, 4, 5-year, what's kind of a 10-year component to that is kind of my question. And then the second is what portion kind of just get an automatic bump when base price for fluff as we would see in the market that's up a good chunk here reflects through. So just kind of help me understand the cadence or the pace as to how this change goes?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Jean-Michel would you take a shot at answering Chris' question around contract versus non-contract and the synergy component?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Yeah. I will. Hi, Chris. I hope you can hear me fine.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Let me try to make something which is a little bit complex a bit easier. When we have price increases, those encompass being with a formula, being with an index, ultimately, we'll get about the same net price increase, it's just a question of timing. One might be immediate, another might be a three to four month maximum, I would say, before it gets applied. So the way to look at it in fluff is whatever the mechanism we have in place, ultimately you do get about the same price increase.","The second question, which is more kind of the contract side, we have most of our contracts, I would say, are one to two years. So we have many of our contracts two years. And some of these contracts are not formal. Some are very formal, some are in countries where they're usually more so, hey, this year the target is, let's say, 57 tons. And I can tell you, it's works as well as a very contractual contract because we are partners for long time and we inter depend on one from the other.","So it's a mix of different things, it's not just one way to do it, which is why maybe sometimes it's confusing. But at the end, it's the same result to the long-term commitments with our customer, and the pricing goes through as the market can accept it depending on our demand versus our supplies. So the normal things of market applies with different mechanism but the same result.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So ultimately, we're still \u2013 it maybe \u2013 it's still a couple year process to get towards your big picture target of $600-ish million?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Yes. I mean, this is \u2013 if you take the average, I would say, cycle prices, which we had around 2015, you can see we're not that yet there. We are progressing significantly this year, but we might be on the pricing only side halfway. On the synergy side, we are ahead. So, yeah, I would say, a couple of years, which is as we said on a normalized price market is what we need to get there.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then one question for Glenn, usually this is the time a year or so when you guys take a look ahead at the pension. I know you did a big settlement last year. But how would you view or think to the appetite as you sit here today to doing another kind of pre-fund component of the pension as you have in the last couple years or do you think you're pretty well set for the next few?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Well, as you know, we have no mandatory contributions in the near term. But with that said, we are in a deleveraging mode and we're looking at all our options to most efficiently deleverage to bring our ratios back in line with our target. So I would say that's an option that's still on the table.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. Good luck, guys.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Hey. Good morning.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hi, Gail.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","I guess, Tim, can you maybe offer some perspective on what you're thinking about in terms of OCC? What's been driving it? What you expect maybe over the balance of this quarter and just fundamentally, is this a new normal?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Well, certainly, over the long term, we've always said we expect OCC pricing to move to higher levels. Our crystal ball is probably not any better than anyone else's in the short term. We think we're going to see some modest uptick in the quarter, in the third quarter. You read a lot and you talk to your people on the ground a lot. I think, first of all, demand which has been pretty strong is one component of it. And then generation, supply being tighter is another component. And what I think I understand is that traditional retailers' generation is not growing. It's holding, but it's not growing. And so there's an e-commerce impact. There's probably a distribution or redistribution impact as well. But I think quite frankly, up at this level and sustained, we see that in the future. This time last year, I don't think any others would have predicted it for this year.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","And I mean, any sense of how much of what's been going on, it's been domestic versus pull from China?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","I think, it's both, China pulled back earlier in the year and maybe there's some timing here as they kind of race to catch up. But I think, it's broad based and you look to other markets around the world and OCC is up in those markets as well, so other countries in Asia. And so I think this is \u2013 you can find pockets where there maybe anomalies, but I think it's fairly widespread.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Gail, this is Mark. Just to add to what Tim said. If you just take it up a level and look at, this OCC phenomena is a great example of this whole business model and you can't look at it in isolation. Kraftliner and OCC go together. OCC begins its life as virgin fiber and as the market for packaging \u2013 sustainable packaging grows, where it grows determined what type of fiber is used, but the feedstock for that fiber is virgin fiber largely generated in the southeast U.S., some in Brazil, some in Northern Europe.","And so the dynamic is China, let's take that as an example, China surprised everyone by really ramping up their collection rate beyond what people thought they could do. And it reached very, very world-class levels and they're there now. So any incremental growth has to be fed with strong fiber coming from other regions and then you got the dynamics that Tim described where we might recycle as individual consumers a little less diligently than a large retailer would. So generation suffers for a while. But at these prices, the market will find its place and OCC becomes really, really valuable. And I know where we live in this area of the country.","OCC generation is actually increasing because the municipalities have really stepped up curbside, making it easy for consumers to do it, may not be the same in dense large cities, but that's something that we will see play out. But it all starts with this pretty good business model of renewable natural resources, making products that are using the by-products to make energy in a carbon-neutral way with biomass. And then in the case of the corrugated box in the U.S., 90% captured and recovered and recycled. So the amount of attractiveness that has with customers and segments is just not to be underestimated.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. And just one last one. A European producer has just announced an acquisition of a U.S. player and they're talking about being a multi \u2013 a supplier to multinational customers. And I'm just wondering as someone that has a toehold in the European market, the Latin American market, is that a real trend and opportunity that you see in the market or is it more in local terms?","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","I'll take the first part. And Mark may have something he wants to add, Gail. But this is \u2013 it's not new necessarily, we've been talking about this for a long time. Certain companies are more equipped and capable of taking advantage of it than others, customers, I mean. Where we can and it adds value for us and it adds value for the customer, we certainly do those kind of things. We do it between our footprint in Brazil, our footprint here and in Europe. So there's certainly opportunities. I personally don't see it as a broad brush type of seismic shift, if you will. And having the capability broadly to meet those customers' needs is sometimes a significant hurdle to get over as well.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning and congratulations to Jay and Guillermo on the new roles.","Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.","Thanks.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Pulp and paper we showed a $20 a ton increase in corrugated medium prices this past month, I was just wondering if you could quantify the impact, if any, that you anticipate.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Hey, it's Tim. It'll be minimal to us. We don't sell a lot. We don't buy a lot. We break for a little bit. So it'll have a minimal impact, not all of our customer contracts reference medium. And so where they do, you can pass through, where they don't, you won't get it but it's single-digit millions on an annual basis for us. Yeah.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, you referenced the very strong export pricing that we've been seeing in the slides, but I'm guessing your margins domestically are still better. Is it possible to quantify how much you pulled out of the export market in 2Q, if you anticipate pulling incremental tons out in 3Q, just kind of the mix of export versus the domestic market given the very strong demand we've seen in the U.S.","Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. We export between, say, 12% and 15%, depending on the time of the year, but year by year, it's in that range. We didn't really pull back a lot during the second quarter. Given Pensacola and its exposure to the export markets, we were working hard to meet all of our demand here in North America and also working to catch up with customers that we have commitments to in other parts of the world. So it was a strong push across all the channels in the second quarter.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glenn, just a clarification on the bridge you gave us. If we take all those pieces, would that get us to about $1.1 billion for the third quarter on EBITDA? I didn't catch everything, so I just wanted to confirm that with you.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Well, I think we outlined the areas on our outlook that we have a clear line of sight on. And if you can pick that back up in the transcript, we don't come out and just give a broad-based number. But directionally, I think if you look at and do the math on the pieces that we've built up, you'll get it in that range, and you could speak to Jay and Guillermo afterwards.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Regarding the bridge as well, what exactly is your pulp price forecast for the second half? And secondarily, what is the flow-through or the anticipated flow-through in the third quarter from your previous price increases that had a, call it, two to three-month lag?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Well, again, we're not going to be forecasting, looking forward on pricing. We gave you the macro view of net-net in the pulp business for the third quarter, an incremental $10 million that has all the pass-through that that's going to come through from what's been announced and that's net from some of the situation relative to volume and the seasonality, as well as the dip in softwood prices. So, again, that's a round number of $10 million net-net.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And just two others, one, in terms of what Jean-Michel was saying, because historically, I believe, softwood and fluff pulp have moved basically exactly in line with each other. So is he saying that he thinks that will de-couple to some extent in the future?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Jean-Michel, do you want to take that?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Jean-Michel speaking here. Yeah, I would take it. When we look at softwood and fluff, you do see some conversion long term but not immediate. There can be a broad band of difference between softwood and fluff, and they don't move at the same speed at all. So I would say a plus 30% or 50% or what is going today on softwood and what is going today on fluff is really not related. We have very different situation in fluff. Even if we have like every year a little bit of seasonality in the summer, which is a bit lower, fluff prices run lower, very stable with the end of the pricing season in fluff versus the slight decrease you have in softwood. So we need a big difference between the two before you can see one of them affecting the other. This level of swing you have in softwood today does not affect fluff at all.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for that Jean-Michel. And just, Glenn, one last one for your on cash flow. Do you expect a meaningful step-up second half versus first half in terms of cash flow?","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Yeah. We don't forecast cash flow either, Adam. But at the end of the day, you could see that there's a significant step-up across the board and cash flow should fall in line with that as well.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Good morning.","Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.","Good morning.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. If you could talk a little bit about a couple of markets we haven't talked a lot about in terms of the markets and that is especially the fluff market as you see the growth there. I know you mentioned Riegelwood is ramping up on the production side a little better than you expected. But what's the demand look like out there? Is it something that's still looking 3% to 4% up? Or is it varying from what the recent past has been?","And then also on uncoated, if you could talk about the fact that outside the U.S. we seem to have prices going up, I believe that's true. Certainly, RISI is saying that. And is that having any impact at all in the U.S. market in terms of us not being as attractive for some of the importers?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Jean-Michel, do you want to take the first question on fluff demand globally?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Yeah. So fluff demand globally is actually very stable growth. I would say the recent trends are even...","[Technical Difficulty] (56:40-56:47)","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","I think we might have lost \u2013 I think we might have lost him. So I'll finish this sentence. Fluff growth, we're seeing in our customer portfolio and I think the public numbers are close, but more than 4% growth. We had built our model in the 3% or so range and we're north of 4%. Some regions did 4%. Some regions even more than that and across a broad-base of uses from baby diapers all the way through the adult incontinence and hygiene products.","And so part of that just have to do with, we just track GDP per capita in different parts of the world with tight correlation when people can afford these products. That's where the highest growth rates are. So we feel really good, Chip, about what we're seeing, there's innovation going on in those products that are making them more accessible to more people around the world. And we are right there in the middle of all that innovation. And that's part of what the combination of IP and warehouse of those products is a much, much stronger innovation DNA inside of our company that we had as IP alone.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you.","W. Michael Amick Jr. - International Paper Co.","Chip, this is Mike Amick. Your question around this particular market, if you look at the data imports into the U.S. whether on a quarter-to-quarter or year-over-year they're roughly flat. There's not been a whole of change there.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood. But are you \u2013 do you anticipate or are you feeling \u2013 because I know you sell paper around the world. Are you feeling the strength or stronger pricing outside the U.S. in uncoated?","W. Michael Amick Jr. - International Paper Co.","We are, we've seen some modest increases as we reported. You see in the appendix pages and also in EMEA as well.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","So Mike, you've been a little bit modest you've got strong pricing pressure in Latin America. And Chip, obviously, it's the differential that makes the U.S. less attractive to Mike's point. We probably will see in the quarters probably stay in the range. It's typically how the market incremental trade flows have worked in the past and that we don't see anything that would say or they would work differently.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.

Results in our North American Industrial Packaging business were significantly affected by rising input costs which negatively impacted earnings by $36 million quarter-over-quarter, along with a slightly less favorable mix and modest price erosion which squeezed our margins a bit.","We announced, and are in the process of implementing, a domestic containerboard price increase as well as a corresponding U.S. box price increase. We continue to see improved market demand across both our North American box business and our global pulp business. We experienced strong operational performances across our North American, EMEA and Brazil papers business as well as continuing strong performance in our Ilim joint venture in Russia.","Also during the quarter, our board of directors approved a 5% increase to our annual dividend in our October meeting moving into $1.85 per share. This marks the fifth consecutive year of a dividend increase since we established our dividend policy in 2012 when the dividend was $1.05 per share. This reinforces our confidence in the strength and sustainability of our free cash flow and our commitment to return a meaningful portion of our cash generation to our shareholders.","Relative to the portfolio, we continue to actively work toward being prepared to close the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business in the fourth quarter. We received the European Union's approval last week, and we received Brazil's approval just this week. But we still await a few others that we hope to receive shortly. Also, we've made a decision not to pursue a potential expansion into containerboard in India. And as a consequence, we wrote off a modest investment we had made in land and engineering for a potential site.","Continuing with our financial results on slide six, you can see the various key metrics in the table on the slide, and I'll remind you of just a couple of points. The year-over-year revenue decline is primarily due to the divestitures of our Sun joint venture and our box business in China as well as the sale of our Coated Bristols business in North America. As you can see on the slide, IP continues to deliver strong margins in varying economic conditions at 17.6% for the third quarter.","With that, I'll turn it over to Carol and return at the end to wrap up and move it to question-and-answers. Thank you. Carol?","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the second to third quarter, you can see that our EPS performance was generally flat. As Mark mentioned, we encountered meaningful input cost inflation in the quarter, primarily on OCC and natural gas. Additionally, we experienced a less favorable box mix along with modest price erosion, predominantly in our North American Industrial Packaging business. These items offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense of $0.10 as well as a lower tax rate in the quarter which was driven by our mix of earnings as well as some one-time discrete items.","Moving to the businesses. Results in the Industrial Packaging segment were negatively impacted by rising input costs and less favorable mix, price erosion and some operational and cost issues, all of which were more than offset -- or more than offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense.","Relative to price and mix, IP experienced a less favorable box mix in the third quarter. Additionally, box prices were down $5 per ton due to the flow-through from the January index change along with modest price erosion. And also worth noting, the average price for our containerboard exports was lower on average in the third quarter as prices stabilized around the exit rate from the second quarter. The negative impact of volume in the quarter was attributable to the seasonally lower volume in EMEA associated with our Moroccan box business.","In operations and costs, we had a couple of isolated issues at two mills which have now been resolved. And we also absorbed extra costs in the quarter due to additional overtime that we incurred in our box system to satisfy increased demand.","Turning to slide nine and continuing on the theme of increased demand, our box business saw a favorable demand trend throughout the quarter with volume up 1.2% year-over-year. The increased demand was driven by favorable trends across IP's key segments highlighted on the slide. We continue to see robust year-over-year growth in online retail and distribution which is a meaningful segment for our business.","IP's customers within the processed food segment have leveled out and are showing some growth as consumer trends continue to shift to healthier product offering and our customers enhance their offering by providing new products to satisfy these needs. Increased production and consumption of beef and pork are driving growth in the protein segment and favorable weather and crop conditions have fueled strong demand in the produce segment.","It is our view, at IP, that the improving box market we are seeing is not an anomaly. Even though GDP has been below expectations in 2016, the consumer segments within GDP have been some of the strongest. And at the end of the day, it's consumer activity that drives the majority of box demand.","Turning to Consumer Packaging on slide 10, the segment delivered another solid performance coming off a robust second quarter. Price and mix were modestly impacted by a less favorable mix of folding to cup business along with some slight erosion. Operations performed well overall but were impacted by several minor cost items in the quarter, including FX in EMEA and other miscellaneous one-time items in the U.S.","Moving to the Printing Papers segment, results across the global businesses were strong, partially offset by another transitional quarter for the pulp business. Papers had a strong operational quarter, particularly in North America. Overall results for the segment were negatively impacted by a strike and other downtime we experienced in India which unfavorably impacted results by about $5 million in the quarter.","Relative to price and mix for North America, mix was slightly negative and pricing was flat to slightly positive. We experienced some lower prices in Europe and on our Latin American exports out of Brazil. Overall, pulp business results declined by $15 million quarter-over-quarter, almost half of which was attributable to higher outage costs in the third quarter. And finally, results were favorably impacted by $6 million due to FX benefits, mostly in Brazil.","Turning to Ilim. The JV delivered another strong quarter with operational EBITDA of $168 million which translated to IP equity earnings of $46 million. Relatively stable FX throughout the quarter resulted in a slight favorable gain for the quarter. Looking ahead, the JV expects seasonally higher volume to be more than offset by seasonally higher wood costs for the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide 13 and moving to an update on recent financing and capital allocation actions we've taken. Early in the third quarter, we completed a debt issuance of$2.3 billion to fund our acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business as well as the voluntary pension contributions that we spoke about on our last call.","Additionally, as Mark mentioned in the opening, earlier this month, IP's board of directors authorized an increase to company's annual dividend of 5% to $1.85 per share which marked the fifth consecutive annual increase to the dividend. This is another meaningful move consistent with our policy of keeping the dividend in the range of 40% to 50% of our free cash flow and speaks to our continued confidence in the sustainability of our cash generation as we look forward.","Before I move to the outlook, let me recap how we continue to think about capital allocation. It starts with cash from operations, and we think about how we can best leverage every dollar. Beginning with capital spending, you've seen us be flexible in terms of how we think about capital, balancing the ongoing need to maintain a world-class fleet with the realities of the marketplace and what we choose to or can afford to spend in any given year. We also continue to have a healthy pipeline of high return cost reduction projects that we fund at an appropriate level on this basis.","From there, we think about the need to utilize and maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet with appropriate leverage and credit rating to give us financial strength and flexibility over time. This includes the need to continue to proactively manage our pension plan as you've seen given the various moves we've made over the last several years.","We are absolutely committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareowners as evidenced by the significant and consistent moves we've made to increase our dividend to a very meaningful level. Additionally, we've supplemented this cash to shareholders with opportunistic share repurchases. And we'll continue to thoughtfully utilize this option in the future.","While we're doing all of this, we continue to look for select value-creating investment opportunities which fit our advantaged position and advantaged market strategy. These may come in the form of M&A, like the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition, or could be more modest bolt-on types of opportunities like the Madrid mill, Riegelwood and our projects within North American Industrial Packaging. Bottom line, we continue to feel that a relentless focus on strong cash generation and a balanced approach to capital allocation is the right strategy for IP to create long-term value for our shareholders.","So moving to the fourth quarter outlook. I'll cover the details around the typical seasonal impacts that we see as we move from the third to the fourth quarter. But additionally, we have a couple of one-time non-recurring items that are expected to impact results for the quarter as well.","So starting at the top. We expect daily demand to remain strong. However, volume will be lower due to four less shipping days in our North American corrugated packaging business. This is expected to negatively impact North American packaging business results by about $50 million. We expect seasonally stronger volume in the Brazil papers business, along with seasonal demand improvement in EMEA packaging.","Relative to price and mix, due to the implementation of the North American containerboard and box price increases, we expect favorable impact in the fourth quarter to be about $20 million. Relative to the North American pulp business, we expect unfavorable impact of about $10 million as we continue to supply additional tons of softwood market pulp into less than favorable market conditions as we work towards qualifying and supplying more fluff pulp out of the new capacity at Riegelwood. Additionally, we expect to see benefits of recently announced and implemented price increases in Brazil papers in the quarter.","Moving to operations and other. We experienced disruptions with Hurricane Matthew in October that unfavorably affected our North American businesses, where we have primary mills and significant business on the East Coast. In our North American papers and pulp business, this, along with other normal fourth quarter seasonal cost impacts, are expected to unfavorably impact results by $25 million.","In our North American Industrial Packaging business, we will also see the impact of Hurricane Matthew on results. Additionally, we expect to incur a non-cash charge associated with inventory revaluation due to our LIFO accounting convention related to the North American containerboard price increase. These items are expected to unfavorably impact results by $35 million.","So, as you think about the fourth quarter, the all-in impact of the one-time items I just covered above, including Hurricane Matthew and the non-cash inventory charge in North American Industrial Packaging, is roughly $45 million that will not repeat after the fourth quarter.","Moving to input costs. On top of the impact we saw in the third quarter, we expect to see additional energy costs in North America as well as inflationary pressure on inputs in our EMEA business. We expect the unfavorable impact across our North American businesses to be about $12 million and about $6 million in Europe.","Maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase slightly by $7 million. We expect Ilim results to be slightly less favorable due to lower operational EBITDA, along with the non-repeat of the favorable $0.01 FX impact from Q3. And finally, we do expect some modest impacts from the other items as we've noted at the bottom of the slide.","So now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Carol. In closing, International Paper continues to deliver solid performance in a global environment that presents plenty of challenges. As Carol mentioned, we remain highly focused on cash generation, and we're on track for another very strong year. We also remain focused on return on invested capital and are delivering another year of strong returns, solidly above 10%, which is well above our cost of capital.","As I think about where we are, how we expect to finish the year and what next year looks like, we are seeing some near-term margin squeeze across many of our businesses as some price erosion has occurred while input costs have turned up. The good news is we continue to execute well and our margins remain strong overall.","We also have some upside ahead, particularly in the North American Industrial Packaging business with the price increases which are underway. In addition to that, while market fundamentals for our global pulp business may remain challenged for a while, the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition provides real and significant synergy opportunities that we can begin to bring to bottom line as soon as we close the transaction.","And while it's a bit further off due to the conversion, our newly acquired Madrid mill provides nice upside in earnings for our European box business. With our continued focus on cash generation and thoughtful approach to capital allocation, I remain confident in our ability to continue to generate meaningful value for our shareholders.","And with that, we'll open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Just one real quick clarification. Did you say the impact from the four fewer days, the volume, et cetera, was that $50 million, you said, or $15 million?","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Yes, Mark, this is Carol. It was 5-0, $50 million.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","5-0 then. It sounds like a really big number for a little bit less for -- the impact from fewer days. Is this standard or is there something else going on here, would you say?","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","It is standard. I think the four-day delta is probably what's wider than normal. I think if you look back, four days is a big delta. But if you look at the size of our system and the value of our shipments, that's the correct math, Mark.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe if you could provide a little bit more color, you were talking about another transitional quarter in the pulp business. I assume has a lot to do with Riegelwood. Can you explain to us where you are in that process? And how much in the way of costs you're entailing? And when you get to the other side of it, what type of opportunity exists? And I realize this gets complicated by the Weyerhaeuser acquisition also being in process. But if you can kind of isolate the -- what you were highlighting as the transitional quarter for the pulp business.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hi, Mark, this is Mark. The third quarter was the first full quarter that we had operations on the converted machine. And I would say from our capital project planning and our ramp up plan, we're pretty much online. The transitional comment is really, as you know, when we think about fluff pulp, we have to qualify that with each and every customer. And that's what we're undergoing right now. So, in the interim, in order to run the machine and make the fluff trials, we make regular market softwood. And obviously pricing has been a little bit depressed. Demand is good. It's \u2013 global softwood's up 4%. But we're selling in \u2013 the market pulp into a lower price environment. So, as we get our specialty pulp, fluff and other grades qualified, the mix on the asset will move up dramatically over time. And we are right on schedule with that and expect to be successful in our different customer trials.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So when you get to the other side of where you are, what type of financial impact, if market conditions were similar to what they were in the third quarter, what type of financial upside would there be as you look at that business?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Well, I don't have a quantified number right off the top of my head, but when you think about the delta between fluff and market pulp prices and you look at that kind of margin enhancement, that's where the real benefit would come from. And as you mentioned, Mark, it will be a little bit of a multi-variable situation when we bring on our Weyerhaeuser acquisition, then a big part of the synergy opportunity is maximizing the efficiency of where we make what product. So that'll start as soon as we close the transaction. And that'll put the margin improvement from making the better grades on a little bit of a turbocharger because we'll be moving grades around to the right assets.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was wondering if you could talk about the pricing impact in Industrial Packaging. If I recall from the last call, I think you said it would be about a $10 million sequential impact. I was hoping you can you talk about the puts and takes there.","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Hey, Debby, it's Tim. I think what Carol just called out is we're expecting about $20 million of impact sequential based on the price increase.","Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I was actually referring to the result in the quarter and the guidance that you gave on the Q2 call.","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah, okay. Well, two things. One of it \u2013 about half of it was a continuation of the pulp through (22:15) that we saw. And then just normal competitive box contracts and mix had an impact as some of the segments that carry lower margins came through stronger in the third quarter than we were anticipating at the time.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hello?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details. And to Carol, Glenn and Bill Hoel, congratulations to everyone on the next chapters, really have enjoyed working with you all. I guess my first question maybe piggybacking on Debbie teeing up the box price question. Obviously, for your own business, when we look at your business or when you look at it, and you see on the one hand there was sufficient weakness in demand or however you would categorize it to lead to box price erosion. Can you comment, perhaps provide some anecdotes or some quantification in terms of how things strengthen for you such that you're now in the process of implementing your own containerboard and box price increase?","And the related question I had on that, and I'll have one follow-on is, when we look at the scanner data, obviously it doesn't exactly map to your corrugated business, but the trends from Consumer Packaging land have not been particularly stellar. How do you begin to reconcile that, guys, from your vantage point, and you have the biggest one in the market, with what's been better containerboard and corrugated demand really over the last couple of months? And I have one follow-on after that. Thank you.","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Sure. Let's take the last question first, George. I think box demand \u2013 and it can always change. It's only as good as our forecast. But box demand is playing out more or less the way we have seen it for a while now in the course of 2016. So we always saw it strengthening. Our model was predicting based on economic performance and inputs that we were going to strengthen through the second half of the year. And so we're seeing that. It's a little bit better, quite frankly, than we might have thought. But our experience has been pretty good as evidenced by the numbers that we posted on demand growth.","Back to your first question, I think there's a few things to keep in mind. First of all, we don't see the dynamics around this price increase being any \u2013 materially different than any other price increase we've ever had. If you look at being down $5 in the quarter, I just explained a part of that is mix, but some of it was the publication down which happened earlier in the year and then also just normal activity. That normal activity has a lag to it, right.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","So some of what's showing up in the quarter is stuff that has already happened, and now it's just materializing. So, when we communicated the price increase to our customers, we were looking at the fundamentals that we saw a point in time, and then our view of how they were going to look going forward. And if anything, I'd say they turned out to be a little bit stronger than what we originally viewed.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that, Tim. And my last one, Carol, I just want to make sure I understood this correctly. I think the one-off items you said for the quarter coming up were $45 million, yet I seem to recall a $25 million and $35 million number. Can you help reconcile a correct \u2013 those numbers? Thank you. And good luck in the quarter, guys.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Yes, George. So the delta is \u2013 remember, I mentioned other seasonal increases. So the simple way to think about that is the total of $60 million minus the $45 million. That would imply the balance of the $15 million would be other normal seasonal increases from third to fourth.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Thanks again, Carol, and congratulations. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Congratulations, Carol. It's been a pleasure working with you.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Thank you.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","I guess a question from me, and just back on the box side of things, I mean among investors there's obviously a lot of questions and debate whether or not, how successful you're going to be able to push through the box price increase. But just curious, how much of that pricing there is contractually tied to PPW? And can you give us a sense of how much of your business is up for bid in a given year as the contracts roll off?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Phil, hi, it's Tim. It varies how much is up for bid. Year-to-year, we've seen some pretty dramatic swings. It's just based on length of contract, length of agreements that we have with customers, and then opportunities that we see along the way for either adding to position and renegotiating early or not. So pretty much everything that we have is based on some form of either contract or customer agreement that we have, whether it's completely formal in the way of contract or it's some other type of agreement. So what we do is we go through, similar to every other price increase we've ever had and for the number of customers we have, it comes down to customer by customer across the whole business.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I think, Tim, you mentioned early just in terms of this implementation, from what you're seeing thus far, it seems like pretty consistent with what you've seen in the past few. Is that a fair characterization?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah, I've seen no dynamics or circumstances that would say it's any different than what we've seen in other price increases.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very helpful. And I guess shifting gears to your consumer business which actually performed pretty well. Pricing is holding up pretty good. Can you provide any color on how backlogs are shaping up on SBS? Any noticeable shifts in the market, either from imports or exports on the bleached board side of things? Thanks. And good luck on the quarter.","W. Michael Amick - International Paper Co.","Hey, Phil, it's Mike Amick. I would characterize the market as kind of okay. As you know, we're kind of heading into seasonally slower fourth quarter. But our volume quarter-over-quarter in Consumer Packaging was about flat. The good news is, is that we're also seeing a little bit of an uptick in food service, both in terms of shipments we saw in the fourth quarter as well as bookings. So we're a little bit optimistic or biased a little bit in terms of what we're seeing. The in-store traffic with food service, since kind of single-serve retail has been a little bit of a headwind this year as you can see reported out with some of the retailers. But overall, we've performed pretty well in that segment and continue to do so.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde with BMO.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. And, Carol, I'd just like to extend my best wishes to you as well. It's been a pleasure.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Thank you, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I wondered if you can just give us any thoughts on sort of CapEx as we move towards 2017? And in particular, I recall a year or two ago, we were talking about some incremental CapEx going into the containerboard mills and I'd like to just get an update on that.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Mark, this is Carol. So let me start that by saying, this year, our CapEx target is $1.3 billion. Our plans for next year at this point are influenced, of course, by the acquisition of the Weyerhaeuser cellulose fiber business. So, including that business, our plans at this point are about $1.5 billion of CapEx. And included in that $1.3 billion and that $1.5 billion is the continuation of the implementation of the projects that we spoke about in our North American Industrial Packaging business that Tim and his team are executing against.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Then I just had two quick follow-ons. One, Tim, can you just clarify where you guys stand on containerboard export pricing and whether you've announced anything there, and just what the volume is for you relative to your overall containerboard business? And then, Mike, I noticed that the food service revenues were flat, and I just \u2013 I know you'd picked up a lot of cup contracts over the last few years, and I just wondered, is all that played out at this point?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah. Hey, Mark, it's Tim. On export, it's \u2013 price is fairly stable as Carol mentioned, on the front end. Demand has been pretty good. This year kraft linerboard exports in total for U.S. producers is up about 2.5%. We look at the demand across the regions, and we say \u2013 we kind of expect somewhere between 2% and 3.5% growth. So it seems like it's right in the expectations, maybe on the low side of expectations for growth. For us, it's somewhere between 12% and 15%, it varies. But we look at it as, for our business, what we're doing is responding to what customers are demanding based on their needs. And there's been some changes in trade flows over the course of the past year given the FX volatility. But we see the markets as pretty stable and continuing to grow at what would be an expected rate.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. No price hikes there, right?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","It feels like things have firmed quite a bit. Our supply chain is very tight at the moment. So we're struggling to even keep pace with the demand that we're getting from customers. So, at the moment, things are extending out a little bit in terms of lead times on export orders.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hey, Mark. On your food service question \u2013 try to simplify this. It's a little more complicated. But in terms of cups, and I'll speak in terms of the bodies themselves, our overall growth is still pretty positive. So those contracts haven't played out. Our flat revenue is a combination of a little bit of mix that's in there as well as some \u2013 a little bit of price decline over the quarter. But that's been relatively small. And the lid side of the business is a little bit down versus the body side. But overall, we're still growing the business.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask one \u2013 I mean perhaps this is a silly question, but it's just something I don't understand. I think you referenced $35 million of a non-cash charge related to inventory revaluation as box prices or as the board price flowed through. Can you help explain to me what that is, how that works? I guess intuitively I would have been thinking, kind of would have been the other way around if prices are moving higher.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Yes, Chris, this is Carol. And I'm going to attempt to do this without belaboring this call with an accounting lesson. But it is somewhat of a complicated issue. In simple terms, we run our businesses in a FIFO model, first in, first out. But we keep our corporate books on a LIFO model, last in, first out. And so we keep that, you call it your LIFO reserve, your LIFO balance, which is your contra inventory account, on the corporate books. And basically, you do LIFO because costs go up through time and that's the best way, the best effect to get the best outcome for the company. When you have a dramatic shift, and for us it's around the inventory between our mills and our box plants, we charge our box plants market price. So we're going to move that board into our box business at the higher price. But you do last in, first out relative to your accounting. So you have to balance that LIFO account.","The other thing that comes into play is you've got to get that LIFO account balanced by year end. So the timing of this increase coming right at the end of the year causes us to have to balance that account in the quarter. What's most important is non-cash. And in LIFO, when you make adjustments to those LIFO balances, it's non-cash. But due to the way we run our business and our accounting convention, that charge hits us in this fourth quarter. So that's my best explanation. And we can always follow up with more if you feel like you want some more information.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, I think that's helpful. So it's not just what would have been referenced here. It's a cumulative catch-up for the full year as well?","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","You've got to get that \u2013 what you do is you get that \u2013 LIFO has to balance by year end. So, if this had happened earlier in the year, we would have done it through the period of time. Why? It's just kind of unique that it's of a significant size. And of course, the scale of our business makes it significant in size and scale.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's helpful. Follow-up question I had was for Tim. So you kind of referenced that box demand has been playing out, I think it was in response to George's question earlier, that box demand has been playing out kind of as you'd anticipated and is pretty solid here through the back half of the year. As you look forward \u2013 and again, fully appreciating this is a very fluid and dynamic market and model, probably. How are you feeling regarding the next, let's call it, 12 months to 18 months? I mean do you still feel that box demand can continue at a point, point-and-a-half sort of pace? What do you think the puts and takes are there?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah, 18 months is a little bit beyond my radar screen there. So I'd put it this way. In the moment, looking forward over the next couple of quarters, we feel pretty good. Our model is only as good as what people are saying the next couple of quarters are going to be on any number of economic activity levels. And so it's been kind of in the zone where there hasn't been a whole lot of change to that that would affect the components of the model. So I feel good about the fourth quarter. Seen nothing that should make us feel any way but positive as we go into the first quarter of next year.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I just wanted to talk about North American Industrial Packaging for a minute. Obviously, the volumes are coming in relatively strong. And you mentioned some of the input cost inflation, but I guess if I look at the year-over-year EBITDA bridge, the input costs are relatively flat year-over-year. So just trying to reconcile, I mean when we look at the increase, is this \u2013 and you mentioned a lot of tightness in your export markets. Is this more of a supply demand driven price increase relative to a input cost increase?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","I think all of those factors weigh on price movements. I would just say this in terms of the year-over-year on input costs, some of this is timing and input started moving up during the third quarter. And the other piece of this, inputs, no question have been a tailwind for the past 12 months or 18 months, but that's recently changed. And I think what may not be as obvious to people looking at our results is the tailwind from input costs did a great job helping us cover normal inflation that we encounter year-in and year-out. And all of a sudden, the tailwind has turned to a headwind. And so the inflation is there and now the input cost rises are there and you get kind of a double impact.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just sticking there for a minute, I think, Carol, maybe you mentioned normal competitive box pressure at least in the third quarter. When I go back and look at the last two price increases in 2012 and 2013, I think there was a period of time there where it felt like the competitive dynamic in the box business had slowed down a little bit and you were actually able to hold pricing on the box side. Did something change over the last 12 months where maybe the box business became a little bit more competitive just versus the post price increase environment?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","No, I don't think so. I think what you've got to keep in mind is that in January \u2013 I mean this is always a competitive business, but in January, there was a published down that impacted price and it's been working its way through our financials based on all of the different customer contracts and agreements that we have. And so, if there's a change this year over prior periods, that happened to us early in the year and we've been dealing with it.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Last one from me. In the prepared slides, slide nine, you mentioned retail and traditional distribution growth. I think you said it was a meaningful segment for you now. Were you referring to e-commerce, and if so, how big is e-commerce now for the total company? Thanks.","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Well, on a relative basis, it's still \u2013 it's big. But on a relative basis, it's still small but growing at a rapid rate. And it's not just online retail, it's also traditional distribution. We have exposure across the spectrum and it's been performing very well for us. So that's one positive. The other positive is the protein segment for us, which has been under some pressure over the past couple of years, seems like it is coming back in a more stable way and processed food for us has also been good. So I think it's a mix of different segments.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Yes, and good morning. And, Carol, great working with you, all the best.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Thanks, Chip.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","First question has to do with something that's kind of perplexed us a little bit. And that is if you -- we have done a deep dive into the sort of unaccounted for tonnage which averages somewhere 150,000 tons to 200,000 tons a month when you \u2013 we get the monthly data, and it seems to suggest that there's been a rather sharp, roughly 200,000 ton drop in what we would consider in transit inventories in the last two months. And I guess if that's true that that would show up in your system with, I guess, lengthening delivery times if that's in fact true. Are you seeing anything in your business that would suggest that there is less out in the field? I'm talking about trucks and railcars. And that's affecting your business at all?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah, I think what we've experienced during the course of the year, and it started late last year, was the supply chain working very efficiently and effectively. And so things are flowing through fairly well. And another piece of it that can impact it is just how months end in terms of whether they end on a weekend or not. And technically things have to be unloaded and hit the floor to not be in transit any more. So there's some anomalies month-to-month and just in terms of how the month ends. But our supply chain right now is incredibly tight. So, as I mentioned earlier on exports, we're pushing things out and we're just \u2013 we're trying to catch up to what we think would be more sustainable levels of inventory across our system.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. And just getting back on the numbers to make sure I understood them. It seems like the impact of Matthew on the non-containerboard mills, I guess that would be Consumer and Paper or Printing Papers, would be $25 million. And then the $35 million refer to just the Matthew and the inventory adjustment in Industrial. Is that correct?","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","So, Chip, the $25 million that we referenced was for paper and pulp. And some sub-segment of that was Matthew. So there's some other costs there. And then the $35 million that we referred to \u2013 I mean the $45 million that we referred to out of the total $60 million was between the two businesses. So there's some subset of that $25 million is Matthew in paper and pulp.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","And it's not an insignificant number, yeah.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Because it looks like when I added up all those numbers you gave us that is \u2013 it's coming up to something like $125 million. And then about $45 million of that is, as you said, one-time, and maybe $80 million of that is \u2013 wouldn't be considered one-time, but would be largely seasonal and other things.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","I think that's \u2013 you're definitely \u2013 that's the right direction for sure.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. And then last one real quickly is, I noticed in the data the last two months that while the AF&PA gives us their survey every year, roughly in May, they certainly imply a certain capacity when you divide what they say production is into the operating rate. It looks like that capacity is actually down the last couple of months. And I didn't know if there was anything you're seeing out there that might explain why we just literally don't see any projects financed across the industry to add discrete capacity additions, especially given the fact that demand is growing especially in tons.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Chip, this is Mark. I think the capacity evolution in containerboard, you go back a couple of years with some of the additions that have come on, there's been a mixed track record in the success of bringing that board into an actual box. So I think that weighs on people's investment decisions. I think the market is pretty well balanced. And I think that that's really the reality. You've got more than just containerboard. You've got to figure out a way to get it through the supply chain into a package that's designed for a customer, so downstream converting into value chain. All of those things are important. And so I think right now, we said this two years ago and 18 months ago, that we thought this capacity would play out, be absorbed, some would work, some wouldn't. And I think that's where we are.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, everyone.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Good morning, Brian.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I just wanted to ask about the containerboard economic downtime. It ticked up a little bit from the second quarter. And I presume some of that is just to help support the price increase you have out there in the market. But now that you've gotten the $40 through, just wondering -- presumably margins are going to be better going forward. Just wondering if we can see that tick back down to some of the levels that we saw before 2016, 2015?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah, I think the premise of the question is not on target. We run our system based on how we need to optimize our margins and service our facilities. And so tons are not tons. The mills produce a range of products. We need more of some and less of others. And we balance it out and make sure that we're doing the right thing from a cash standpoint and the right thing from a margin standpoint.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. And then just wanted to better understand the timing of the earnings benefit you'd expect from the higher containerboard pricing. I think you referenced a $20 million benefit into 4Q which is obviously less than the annualized impact of it. But do you think it will be kind of fully in your numbers by the end of the first quarter, and so you'd kind of see it in the 2Q numbers? Or how do you kind of expect it to the flow through the numbers?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","I expect it to flow through pretty much on the same pace and track that prior increases have flowed through. So we've got tens of thousands of customers. We've got contracts and agreements with all of them and it will follow the cadence of those agreements. And it's really no different than what it's been in prior times. It's usually pretty fast. It's usually over a couple of quarters, but...","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That helps. And just one last one if I could. I think, just looking at the maintenance outage schedule, looks like it came down a little bit for Industrial and Printing Papers. Just wondering if there's some stuff is just kind of slipping to 2017, or are you just seeing better productivity or maybe lower costs or just what's kind of driving that?","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Yeah, Brian, this is Carol. One of the things that we do is we put a plan together at the beginning of the year of what we feel like where \u2013 want to execute against and then we work like crazy throughout the year to find better ways to do things and opportunities. And so evidenced by the way Mark talked about the business and the conditions, we've worked hard to find better ways. And yes, some things we've pushed out to \u2013 but we feel very comfortable with those decisions. And we feel like we've got a great plan and a good plan for the fourth quarter.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, appreciate it, and good luck, Carol. It was great working with you.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And, Carol, best of luck to you, and thank you. One on -- just follow-up on box demand. I know George asked earlier about the apparent disconnect between CPG demand and box demand. But there's also been a disconnect between industrial demand and box demand. Industrial and CPG are two pretty big pieces of the box market that seem to be flat to going in the wrong direction. So what are we missing in terms of why box demand is doing apparently much better than the broader economy?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah, well, I don't know that I can answer that fully. But I would say this, we think that non-durable production is, in part, a good proxy for box demand. But it's not always in the moment lined up exactly the same way. There's been periods where box demand has outperformed non-durables and vice versa. And there's other components of economic activity that actually influence box demand.","Some of our demand trends have been things I mentioned earlier, where protein is starting to come back off some depressed levels over the past couple of years. Distribution and online retail continues to grow for us quite well. And processed food has actually been pretty good for us. You have to remember, a year or two ago, shrinking at 3%; doesn't feel like it's doing that any more. So it's not stellar growth, but it's not performing as bad as it has in prior periods. So I think that based on the way we look at how box demand gets driven, it's performing the way we would expect it to in the moment.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Adam, this is Mark.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks \u2013 go ahead, Mark.","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Yeah, just kind of, one of the views we have in addition to the segment discussion Tim had, if you think back to the GDP number for the quarter and you look at the total, it was very modest. But if you look at the components, the consumer section of GDP was up almost 3%. Those are the kinds of activities by the consumer that drive box demand. Even if they're trading out of a consumer good into a fresh good or other segment, with a consumer component of GDP at 2.8%, it's pretty squared with our mind around why box demand's at 1.5%. There was a lot of negatives on the non-consumer side which netted out a 1.4% GDP. So, for us, it looks like it squares up pretty well.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for that clarification, Mark. And Tim or Mark, just one more \u2013 I think, Tim, you talked about your supply chain being quite tight. I think in response to George's question about box price erosion, you were talking about how some of it is a lag from the January cup, but some of it is related to competitive activity. So, if your supply chain is really tight, why would there be sufficient competitive activity on the box side such that you're seeing erosion in your box prices to a fairly meaningful degree?","Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.","Yeah, and mix was a piece of it too, Adam. And I think just timing. Some of these things get settled as a negotiating point at a point in time that take through to work their way towards implementation. So I mean, to me, we're not seeing anything unusual or abnormal from every other time we've had inflections in pricing. So it feels completely normal to me.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much, Tim. Appreciate it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple quickies. First of all, I just wanted to make sure I understood the charges in India. If I understood correctly, you were actually doing some infrastructure development as opposed to just due diligence for a packaging venture?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","No. What that was is we were looking at potential containerboard investments in India. In order to do that, we had to make some investments to secure some potential land for sites. And then we just did some engineering work to model different types of business models, whether it be a recycled machine or whether it included box business or not. So those engineering charges, we didn't build anything. We just did some engineering. And then we had a small security deposit on some land.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, thanks. And then just a wrinkle, please, on the LIFO\/FIFO question. And Carol confirmed what we know, which is you're doing transfer pricing at market value. So I guess I just want to know, is it fair to say that the delta in November will remain a $50 a ton or does the PPW print cut that to $40?","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Steve, I appreciate the question. But I would respectfully decline to answer the exact transfer pricing in our company. But what I would say, and I'm looking at my colleague Tim, and Bill across the table, we announced a $50 increase for October with our customers and that's the increase that we're out pushing and implementing at this point in time.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, and best wishes to Carol and Glenn and everyone on their transitions. Just a question on Printing Papers. In the quarter, I think you referenced lower prices in Europe and some of your Brazilian exports. I'm just wondering, has that continued in 4Q? And with paper prices maybe improving domestically in Brazil, are there opportunities to repatriate some of those export tons into Brazil if demand is a little better there?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","Anthony, this is Mark. On Brazil, the majority of what showed up in pricing for export was actually mix of product and geographic mix. So, in terms of the price in a same store, if you will, or same market, it's pretty stable.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, okay. And then just kind of tacking on a general question on Brazil. The 4Q view, I mean, you get a little bit of help from seasonality, but are you seeing any kind of improvement or inflections in Brazilian demand, either paper or containerboard, just from maybe a bit more stronger demand there or a kind of recovering economy at all?","Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.","We are. We are seeing some improved demand in our box business. And for our box business had one of the best quarters since we've owned it in Brazil. And so, as the government moves to a more stable situation, I think there's many experts saying it could turn positive in the economy next year, which will be helpful. And on the paper side, demand in Brazil is pretty steady. It's not as high as it was pre-recession and pre-crisis, but pretty steady.","And as a follow-up on the question you asked about export, because the Brazil demand is steady, we have announced a price increase for the export business that's effective in the fourth quarter.","So that whole system of Brazilian production for Brazil, and then the Brazilian production for the rest of Latin America and the Middle East and Africa and Europe is all \u2013 seems to be getting a bit stronger. So we are out with a price increase for the fourth quarter in the export business.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. The pension, I assume what you're showing in the balance sheet is the change quarters, just the contribution. And if that's the case, I was wondering if you could give at least a little bit of insight to how you might \u2013 the kind of recent moves in the market since you revalued midyear as well as interest rates might reflect the pension when you reported on your 10-K?","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","Yes, Gail, this is Carol. So just one changed to what we said. We actually had to revalue the pension at the end of the third quarter. Once we triggered the accounting treatment in the second quarter that puts you kind of in a new territory. And if you have any change in the pension, you're required to remeasure.","So we actually remeasured in the third quarter. And in the third quarter remeasurement, the interest rates, discount rates, they dropped another 20 basis points. So what you're seeing for that \u2013 the gap, you're seeing the positive impact of the contribution and the performance, negative impact from the discount rate. And that'll all be very clear to you when we come out with our Q.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. And just a couple of other quick ones. Are you expecting a dividend from Ilim this year? Usually, I would have thought you'd have announced it by now.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","We actually did. We got that dividend, was in the second quarter.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay.","Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.","We announced it in the second quarter. And I think it's \u2013 because we do that annual chart, it's not showing up. But it was there. I think it was \u2013 what was it? $55 million. But we've already gotten that cash in.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. And then just on the storm impact, the numbers that you're giving, I mean is everything in the past at this point? Or are there kind of any potential lingering issues in terms of logistics, customer start-ups or fiber costs down the road?","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","What \u2013 the numbers that I gave you is our attempt to capture it all in the quarter. There's some flow-through that's continuing with us which is some fiber costs. And there's some transportation disruption. But most of it is in the rearview mirror. But there's a little residual that'll hang over because clearly that area was just hit so hard and some devastating damage.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And I would now like to turn it back over to Jay Royalty for any closing remarks.","Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.","Thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this morning.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]","Thank you and I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Royalty, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin.","Jay Royalty","Thanks Brandy and good morning everyone and thank you for joining International Paper's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter of 2016 earnings press release and today's presentation slides.","Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark S. Sutton","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I\u2019m going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered solid first quarter driven by continued strong performance in our North America Industrial Packaging business along with improved results in our global papers business.","Demand across our businesses was at or slightly better than expectations. Our operations performed well and input costs were favorable. The Riegelwood conversion to fluff pulp was completed several days ago and we had have commenced start-up and qualifications.","The Ilim JV had another strong quarter of results and we announced a couple of important strategic moves both of which will benefit IP\u2019s returns and are really all about making our best business, our Industrial Packaging business even better. We reached a definitive agreement to sell our Asia Industrial Packaging, which is expected to close in the second quarter.","We also reached an agreement to acquire state-of-the-art newsprint mill in Spain from Holmen Paper, which we plan to convert to high performance recycled linerboard to strengthen our value proposition to our customers and enhance the results for our European Industrial Packaging business. We plan to use all of that containerboard inside of our converting system.","Turning to Slide 6, just like to give you a little more color on our financial performance. IPs revenue declined year-over-year, its primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China, which took place in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also incurred cost of about $45 million exclusive of outage expenses associated with the Riegelwood conversion and this was a significant drag to earnings in the quarter. Margins would have been about 100 basis points better absent this impact. Our free cash flow of $311 million was on par with last year\u2019s first quarter.","At this point, what I would like to do is turn it over to Carol and she will walk us through the performance of our individual businesses and the second quarter outlook. Then I\u2019ll return to wrap it up and we\u2019ll open it up for your questions. Carol.","Carol L. Roberts","Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a sold first quarter at $0.80 EPS with favorable operations and input cost offset by lower prices, seasonally lower volume and heavy maintenance outages including the Riegelwood conversion. The positive swing at Ilim is FX related primarily due to the strengthening of the Ruble as it relates to the JV\u2019s U.S. dollar denominated net debt.","Turning to the businesses on Slide 8. Industrial Packaging as Mark said, had a strong quarter, we had favorable operations and lower input cost, but they were mostly offset by lower export and box pricing, seasonally lower box volume as expected and high planned maintenance outage expense. Export volume did rebound from a weak fourth quarter. The North American business took 212 tonnes of economic downtime to balance our supply with our demand and adjust our needs to match a more efficient supply chain. Input costs were positively impact by lower cost of OCC diesel fuel.","Turning to Slide 9, IP\u2019s North America box demand came in generally as expected with year-over-year volume up 1.3% for the first quarter, which was in line with the industry. The quarter finished and strong in March and that momentum has continued through April. As you can see in the table, which highlights several of IP\u2019s key customer segments, we see several encouraging trends. We continue to see strong growth in online retail, which has become more meaningful for overall demand, the large process through segment is beginning to show some positive signs as a major companies are making moves to adjust to changing consumer preferences.","The agricultural segment which IP is a major supplier, is enjoying the most favorable weather conditions the regions have seen in a few years and this points solid growth of the 2016. And the outlook for the important protein segment is improving, so net-net a fairly favorable outlook for the business.","Turning to Europe as Mark mentioned, we recently announced a strategic move to require a unique asset that can be converted to very effectively complement our corrugated packing network in the region. This transaction will create significant value from both the customer offering and financial standpoint, as it will enable IP to produce to high performance lightweight recycled containerboard in region. We will acquire the mill along with associated recycling operations and Holmen\u2019s ownership position in an onsite per generation facilities","Upon closing of the deal, we will initiate plans for the conversion of the state-of-the-art news print machine to a first cortile test liner machine, which we expect to complete in late 2017. Once we configured, the machine will produce 420,000 short time of recycled containerboard, which will enable IP to integrate a majority of our test liner needs. The total investment for the acquisition and conversions is expected to be approximately $160 million with an expected IRR of more than 15%.","If you turn to Slide 11, in addition to the attractive age and technology of the machine, as well as mill configuration, the location of the mill in relation to the majority of our box network is very attractive. The grades of high performance test liner that we intend to produce on this machine have the greatest application for our broad base of industrial customers and most of these are served out of box plants in Spain, France and Northern Italy as shown on the highlighted area of the map. So once again, we're excited about the prospect of this move and what it can do for our customers and International Paper.","Turning now to Slide 12, let me talk about consumer packaging where we saw a seasonally slower quarter combined with some pricing pressures, a less favorable mix and heavier outage expense resulted in lower earnings for the business in the first quarter. Most of the pricing pressure was felt in the commodity place segment. The timing of volume and higher value mix in the food service business was slower to materialize than we had expected as well. Additionally, the sale and exit of the Coated Bristols business negatively impacted results in the quarter.","Now moving to Slide 13 and talking about our printing paper segment, the slide shows a sequential bridge for the entire segment, which does include our pulp business. As was mentioned earlier, the cost and tax of the Riegelwood conversion, along with the sub-optimized operation at Riegelwood as conversion of PM18 was underway, significantly impacted segment results to the first quarter by approximately $45 million in total.","we'll continue to see cost impact from the conversion in the second quarter along with startup and qualification cost that will continue to impact results in the second quarter and the second half of 2016. This is consistent with the outlook, we provided last quarter and is fully captured in the outlook that I'll share with you shortly.","Slide 14 shows the result of the global paper segment excluding pulp and the impact of the conversion. Volume was seasonally weaker as we expected larger in Brazil, while demand in North America was solid. Good operations and lower input cost contributed favorably to the result, as is lower planned maintenance average expense.","Prices were lower in North America but higher in Europe, Russia and Brazil, as we began to see the benefit of the implementation as previously announced price increases, some price increases are announced in North America and are being implemented in the second quarter.","Let me give a little more color on Riegelwood, as Mark said, we are pleased that the conversion has been completed on-time and on-budget in the month of April and startup and qualification of the machine has commenced. Production of softwood market pulp is underway and then we'll move to qualification of fluff pulp, we expect to begin fluff trials in the third quarter.","The current pricing environment for softwood market pulp, which is use for paper towel and tissue product is under pressure in the near-term. As we ramp up and produce SBSK on the new machine through the rest of 2016, these current conditions will adversely affect earning. This will improve as we qualify fluff pulp on the new machine and optimize production across our system.","Turning now to our Ilim JV, JV had another very strong quarter with operational EBITDA of $176 million and strong manufacturing performance partially offset lower pulp prices and seasonally lower volume. Over the course of the first quarter the Ruble strengthened slightly against the dollar, which resulted in a favorable non-cash FX gains on the JV, $600 million of U.S. denominated net debt and that impacted or first quarter earnings favorably by $0.03 per share. Lower pulp prices and seasonally higher wood cost along with planned maintenance outages at the Bratsk and Koryazhma mills are expected to negatively impact second quarter results.","So before I turn it back over to Mark, let me give you the second quarter outlook. Earnings will increase due to seasonally higher volume in North American box and Brazil papers. The additional box volume is expected to favorable impact North America Industrial Packaging earnings by roughly $40 million. The impact of seasonally stronger demand in Brazil is expected to positively impact earnings by $10 million.","Moving on to pricing in North America, the expected impact of lower pulp prices in a less favorable mix associated with the ramp up of Riegelwood on softwood pulp in the second quarter ids about a negative $20 million. This is net of the benefits of the previously announced price increases in uncoated free sheet in North America.","Pricing for North America Industrial Packaging will be impacted by lower export pricing along with the flow through of the January PPW index change that will move through the boxes. Combined, this is expected to negatively impact earnings in the range of $25 million to $30 million. Prices are expected to improve in Brazil papers as a previously announced price increases are implemented. This will favorably impact earnings by about $10 million.","Operational costs in North America Industrial Packaging are expected to improve as a result of seasonally stronger demand and utilization along with other cost reduction and improvement initiative. This will be a benefit of roughly $30 million. Operational cost across the other businesses are expected to remain favorable and input costs are expected to remain generally favorable as well, although we do expect some slight pressure in Europe.","Maintenance outage expense will continue to be heavy in the second quarter, but are expected to decrease by a total of $22 million as shown on the slide, mainly due to the lower outage cost at Riegelwood. And relative to the Ilim JV, the items you see on the chart are expected to negatively impact IP equity earnings by approximately $10 million to $15 million and additionally we are assuming stable FX coming out of the quarter as you know we don\u2019t attempt to forecast currency. So the outlook assumes a non-repeat of a $0.03 from the first quarter.","So with that overview, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark S. Sutton","Thank you Carol. So let me wrap things up before we take your questions. I feel really good about our execution in results from the first quarter and I\u2019m encouraged that demand feels more favorable across the primary markets that we serve. Our focus remains on the execution and we saw benefit from our efforts in the first quarter in terms of good operational performance and lower cost. The conversion at Riegelwood went well, it was on-time and on-budget and our team is now ramping up and qualifying the new capability. All of this will enable International Paper to continue to generate strong free cash flow which we will allocate to create additional value.","We\u2019ve also made some key decisions that will improve IP\u2019s portfolio and make it stronger and further improve returns on invested capital, namely our decisions in Asia and Madrid and you will see more of this as we move forward where it makes sense for International Papers and our stakeholders. We have winning strategies in the right markets and our focus is clear as you are seeing in the moves we are making. We are focused on producing products where we have a distinct advantage with good access to fiber and low cost manufacturing. We are concentrating our efforts on the markets and product lines that give IP the greatest potential to generate meaningful earnings and attractive returns.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to the operator and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen [Operator Instructions] in the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mark and Carol, two part question for my first question. Do you still expect D&A expenses of $1.3 billion this year, just given that they fell a bit below what I was expecting this quarter? And relatedly, your EBITDA was down 14% in the first quarter. Do you still think you can be close to flat this year, or if not, what do you think reasonable expectations are along those lines for EBITDA? Thank you.","Carol L. Roberts","Adam this is Carol and I\u2019ll take the first one on the D&A. Yes, we do still expect to be in the range of $1.3 billion, what happens is there is some variability to it when you have milled down from outages, you stop your depreciation for that period of time. So it\u2019s just really just some lumpiness in it but overall $1.3 billion is still a good number for the year.","Mark S. Sutton","Adam on EBITDA, your question about how we feel about the flat year-over-year, it\u2019s obviously got some scratch in it with some of the pricing headwinds that has occurred, but at the same time as I mentioned in my comments, we feel really good about our execution and our ability to make improvements in our businesses, both commercially and operationally.","So I think we\u2019re very much still in the range we\u2019ve been able to accomplish that. We got a lot of the year left and we've got some real positive trends on our commercial front and we\u2019re operating very, very well. so we are all about focused on hitting that EBITDA that we talked about.","Adam Josephson","Thanks Mark. And just one on containerboard exports. Can you just comment - forgive me if I missed this, on what your export volumes were sequentially and year-over-year. Obviously, the trade press has talked about export prices falling to cash costs for some of the higher cost mills in the U.S. I'm just hoping you can address this issue and thanks very much.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Hey Adam this is Tim. Demand actually is holding up reasonably well in the fourth quarter, I think we called out - our volume was down, we called out some reasons around that that were situational and we thought temporary and in the first quarter we saw a rebound, then export volumes up. We were still a little bit lower in total than we were in the first quarter of last year. Part of that - in fact a big part of it is really Turkey and the dumping tariff that has been imposed then just simply how we're thinking about our participation in the market.","It\u2019s still a very key market for us, but not every account there is equal and so we made some decisions in terms of how we were going to position ourselves in the first quarter and going forward. I would say demand is good, our price gets written about a lot, it doesn't feel like our experience is quite as negative as all the things that has written about it, but there is no doubt, there are some competitive situations out there and there is a little bit of price pressure. That will probably continue as we go through the second quarter.","Adam Josephson","Thanks very much Tim, I appreciate it.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is comes from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Good morning. Mark, I wondered if you guys, maybe you and Tim, could just help us a little bit as we think about these PPW adjustments back in February and how they roll through first quarter, second quarter and into the second half.","Mark S. Sutton","Mark, I'll ask Tim to take that","Timothy S. Nicholls","Good morning Mark. Yes I mean Carol kind of spotted a number, it was fairly minimal in the first quarter, we're dealing customer-by-customer and contract-by-contract and they don't all work exactly the same way. And certainly given the timing of the PPW adjustments in the first quarter, not very much of that flow through in the quarter.","it will ramp up in the second quarter and Carol pointed out a combination of PPW and export being between $25 million and $30 million. The bulk of that we think is because of the price adjustment with the index and we'll talk to you about third and fourth quarter as we go through the year, as we continue to work through all of the customer contract. So but you will see a fairly significant step-up first to second.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And Tim, as we think about trying to model out the third and fourth quarter, would it be fair to assume some additional bleed-through carrying into third and fourth quarter?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Possibly it's hard to say Mark. I mean, I would rather do the work and get through it and then talk to you that what we think it will be in the third quarter as we finish the second quarter with the same we did going into this quarter.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right. That's fair. And just staying on the containerboard and Industrial Packaging business, you have taken about 440,000 tonnes of economic downtime over the last six months. I wondered if you could talk about how you're taking that. Are you slowing back? Are you actually idling machines for a week or two here or there? And is there a point where you need to consider a longer term move on the supply side?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Well, we'll see, I think the power of what we're doing is just as the power of the system and the flexibility that we've built and some of the investments that we're making is all around building capability and flexibility in the system. We know that when you're stretching the system in terms of utilization rates, things don\u2019t always work out the way you want them to and we've built a tremendous amount of flexibility and a very strong system.","so I can't say what it will be going forward. What I can say is, we look over a multiple periods, out months at a time, not just within a quarter and we target where we think we need to be, in terms of how we run the system and then we adjust that almost day-to-day and week-to-week based on a variety of factors.","One thing that happened in the fourth quarter really late third and continues to be a factor is just how efficiently the supply chain network is running right now and so what it meant for at moment in time as we need less inventory and so we've adjusted our production accordingly to match that. We'll have to monitor that overtime, things don\u2019t stay the same, they have a tendency to move around, so we'll have to see how supply chain performs through the rest of the year.","Mark S. Sutton","Mark, if I could just add to Tim\u2019s comment. One of the things we've learned as our system has been optimized and its gotten as large as its gotten. We clearly create more value in our containerboard and box system, when there is a bit flexibility in the system and we create less value when we try to run everything to its limits and I mean commercial value and our ability to respond to customers, run an efficient box network and also actual cost value in properly maintaining the equipment before the expensive failures occur.","And so that few percent on maintenance and that few percent on economic flexibility, economic downtime really ends up creating the best opportunity for us to generate the highest margins. So it\u2019s something that we don\u2019t look to solve to zero, because I think if it was zero we would have a very difficult commercial proposition for our customers.","Mark Wilde","Alright. That\u2019s really helpful Mark. Good luck in the second quarter and trough balance of the year. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Chercover from D.A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover","Thank you and good morning, everyone.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Good morning Steve.","Steve Chercover","First question. Hi Tim. I wanted to ask about the announcement of a new fluff pulp mill in Arkansas at a cost of $1.3 billion. Will that seriously upset the supply demand dynamic, and what does it say about the value of fluff pulp assets, perhaps?","Mark S. Sutton","Steve, we saw that we had a little bit of knowledge about the background there. It\u2019s hard to predict what that facility is going to do and when. I think fluff pulp is a highly technical product, you have to have a customer list and a track record. So it will be an open question about whether or not a mill that\u2019s in theory can make the product actually ends up with a large book of business in that. And there are different degrees of absorbent products that are loosely lumped into fluff.","What we concentrate on is the higher end, high performance products that are medical device type of products. So can\u2019t speculate on what that particular company is going to try to do, but obviously there is a lot to being successful in fluff pulp over the long-term, primarily because of the branded nature of the consumer product that it goes into. And we\u2019ve been added for a while and have a premium customer list that wants us to continually provide them new material?","Steve Chercover","Did you want to take the bait on the value of fluff pulp assets in general?","Mark S. Sutton","I must not have, because I didn\u2019t. No I think my comments all fluff is not create equal and there are types of products I think should characterize the value of fluff pulp is a highly valuable product given the technical nature of it and the consumer branded equity that\u2019s behind those products that it goes into.","Steve Chercover","Great. Thank you, Mark. And then a quick one for Carol. We know that the average shares outstanding was 414 million. Was the ending share count significantly different? Did you maybe ramp up the repo as your confidence grew through the quarter?","Carol L. Roberts","I think we\u2019ll show that - the repo in the quarter was a $100 million and I\u2019m looking at my colleagues here on the final share count, but I think we can factor in the 100 million purchase and that\u2019s what we did in the quarter Steve. So its continuing to move down and are intent is to continue to be opportunistic with our buybacks.","Steve Chercover","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng","Hey guys. Post Riegelwood, I would imagine a very large chunk of your business is more on the food service side, which is holding up okay, I would imagine, especially on the cup side. But with the PBW cut on SBS, is it about 40% of your business that gets impacted? And then how should we think about the lag in terms of it flowing through your P&L?","W. Michael Amick","Hey Philip this is Mike Amick, yes the numbers are going to be roughly 30% to 35% of our business could potentially be impacted by that in 2016. We primarily see this being a second half phenomenon.","Philip Ng","Okay. And how would you guys characterize supply\/demand in the bleach board market? Certainly, Riegelwood should help. But I guess one of your competitors did bring back an idled mill, and then you've got some of that potential capacity making its way into the US market from the European. How do you guys think about supply\/demand medium to longer term? Thanks.","W. Michael Amick","So this is Mike again. I would characterize the demand is okay, I don\u2019t know that I have used the term really strong, but through the quarter we\u2019ve seen improving backlogs, order backlogs by almost 50% as we look through the quarter. So I think right now kind of sitting where we are in the first part of April, we\u2019re about where we were this time last year.","Philip Ng","Okay. And just one last one from me. Mark, you talked about how demand in the quarter for containerboard firmed up with Ag picking up and e-commerce certainly seeing a lift, as well. Can you remind us how you're thinking about box shipments for the full year now, in light of some of the strength you've seen in 1Q?","Mark S. Sutton","I\u2019ll let Tim take that.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes, I mean last quarter we said we thought it would be for the full-year total market 1% to 1.5% I don\u2019t think our view has changed that much. I would say that we did see the quarters strengthen as we went through the first quarter and market is very strong for us. April continues to be very strong for us. Right now, Mark today we\u2019re in the up 2% range. So some of these segments that have been weighing against us over the past few quarters are starting to turn hopefully and we\u2019ll see if it holds up and we feel pretty good right now.","Mark S. Sutton","Yes, I think Tim\u2019s point tells us that every organization has a mix, customer mix and we like what we\u2019ve seen in some of the trends and the mix that\u2019s particularly heavy for International Papers. So that should lead us to tracking a lot more consistent with what the overall market is doing versus maybe have past experience. So we feel good about that.","Philip Ng","And the mix dynamic with protein potentially picking up in the back half, with the beef cycle turning, that should be a positive for you guys, as well. Are we thinking about that right?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes, I think so, first thing, hopefully is stabilize and we'll see how it plays out the rest of year. Processed food actually for us this mix of customers that we have trended pretty favorably during the first quarter and looks like its holding up in the second quarter. I mean, I'm not going to specifics, but we saw individual names being two, three, four plus percent in the quarter and it got stronger as we went through the quarter.","So its Ag, California is getting rain that's a good thing, so we're well positioned and in that part of the market and then everybody talks of e-commerce but it's really contribution, we've got a mix of customers across the e-commerce space as well as distribution and have show pretty good strength across the board.","Philip Ng","Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Your next question is comes from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. One quick follow-up on the DD&A question from before. I saw that the Consumer Packaging business was down quite a bit. Was that all Riegelwood? And I noticed that the pulp hadn't gone up. Does that go up once the conversion has taken place?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, Mark. What we did is, we moved that mill of Riegelwood which was a shared mill between the two segments, both coated paperboard segment and paper segment that's now moved all the way over into NAPP, so it's less coated paperboard hence the change there. And just was the mill down most of the quarter for the conversion and no actual annual outage that\u2019s what you saw, so that will not show up in the NAPP segment.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. So the Consumer Packaging runs at this $25 million a quarter now in North America, instead of the $45 million it had been for DD&A??","Carol L. Roberts","Yes.","Mark Weintraub","Analyst : Okay. And then on uncoated free sheet, is it fair to say that you are not reflecting a lot of impact from the price increase which is just currently underway in the second quarter, and so success on that, if it comes through, would largely show up in the third quarter and maybe if you could modify a little bit?","W. Michael Amick","Well Mark, yes you are accurate in your statement, it will be. We started to see a little bit in second quarter, but it will primarily be a second half event and primarily split between the third and later part of third quarter and maybe a little in.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America.","George Staphos","Hi everyone. Good morning. Congratulations on the performance, especially in Industrial. Had a couple questions. First of all, in Industrial, can you update us on your thoughts as to how you might be able to increase your vertical integration? Are you seeing opportunities for investment, either organically or through M&A, to be able to accelerate that, if that's still a goal? And the related point on containerboard, do you have a need for any similar moves like you did with Holmen, and what are the implications of that investment relative to your supply chain in North America? And I had a quick follow-on, if possible.","Timothy S. Nicholls","On your first question, George, its Tim here, on integration, good morning. I would say we like all of the channels that we're in, we're operating in multiple channels, obviously the integrated channel is the largest and it's very important to us, it's going to come down to how we win accounts in the marketplace and align ourselves with customers within segments. So there is no stated specific goals that we have to reach at certain integration levels. Acquisitions, we don't comment on speculation, but we look at lot of things and so, we'll continue to do that and if one make sense then we'll be talking to everyone about what it is and why we think that makes sense.","In terms of Holmen, we don't expect the big impact from one region to another at all, but the related question around are there things like that? I think that's what you see us doing in some of these investments that we're making. We've talked about increasing capacity and adding flexibility, it's not that all capacity is the same. What we're doing is we're adding capability around certain products that we think are growing through our segments and we think we need and we're building that capabilities. So, it's similar to Holmen, it's just different, we've got 16 mills where we can look at the product mix that we need to make investments accordingly.","George Staphos","Okay, Tim. I'll turn it over, since I had my two, and I'll try to come back. Thank you.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Thanks George.","Operator","Your next question is comes from Lars Kjellberg of Credit Suisse.","Lars Kjellberg","Hi. Just a question actually on the Holmen transaction. When I'm looking at your Industrial Packaging business in Europe, the problems seem to be that you have very low margins in your box business. This doesn't necessarily fix that problem. So how do we - are you thinking about addressing that business in itself, because just adding upstream integration doesn't necessarily fix what seems to be a low margin business.","Mark S. Sutton","Lars hi, this is Mark. Building on Tim\u2019s comments about channel, the way we look at our European corrugated business. It\u2019s a very focused business, we look at it as one of our channels to market, we move very high quality high performance craft liners through that system. If you look at the geography, we\u2019re southern focused on fresh foods and so our view of that business is its part of our integrated channel to market and the integration of high performance recycled liner coupled with our U.S. produced high performance craft liner makes that whole value proposition better.","It allows us to improve our customer mix and as you know from the European theatre, the recycled board that\u2019s available is geographically available. So you have to have what you need were you need it in a reliable way to build out your offering for your customers and that\u2019s what this does to improve that business. So what we focus on in our European corrugated business is very good for the company and when you take it back at look at the way we think about industrial packaging globally it\u2019s a really good business for IP.","Lars Kjellberg","Just a follow-up on that. There's a tremendous amount of conversions that hits the market tail end 2017, early 2018. We're talking about almost 2 million tons. Is that a consideration at all for you as a non-integrated system today? Is this the right time to do it?","Mark Sutton","Well that phenomenon Lars has been sort of a fixture in the European market. There has been a couple of million tonnes overhang. The problem with that statement is its on average and again recycled high performance liner is not all created equal, there are three to four grade levels including medium. And so what has to happen is converter like International Paper have to have what we need, where we need it.","So if it\u2019s in the North of Europe, it\u2019s theoretical, even if it\u2019s an overhang, it doesn\u2019t really affect. So what you have to look at is regional capacity and we\u2019ve been a large open market buyer for a long period of time and we will still buy some, but that\u2019s how we look at it. Regional board for the conversion that you need in the market segments that you are focused on not the average container supply and demand for all of Europe, which is a very diverse market especially for the recycled liner.","Lars Kjellberg","Very good. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Mark Connelly","Thanks. Just two quick things. Can you give us an update on the timing of the 250,000 tons of new containerboard capacity that you're adding here? We've talked about it as a gradual ramp. I'm just wondering if you can give us some sign posts and tell us when that would be up and running. And second, it looks like you've cut your containerboard maintenance numbers. Is that a change in scope or just improved efficiency?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Hey Mark its Tim. On the first question of capacity there is really no difference than what we said at the time we announced that we said it is going to be a 16, 17 set of actions. So I don\u2019t know if its half\/half, but you will see some of it come through this year and you will see a little bit more come through in the first half of next year.","And then on maintenance, maintenance varies mill-by-mill and period-to-period and so there is a plan, there is a schedule that goes out years and you look at it piece of equipment-by-piece of equipment and it just happens that you will hit periods when the things that need to be tended to in an annual outage cost more, because of the nature of the work in a given period than in others.","Carol L. Roberts","And I would add to that Mark, this is Carol, while we do see the reduction from the last time we forecasted the second quarter down is we know as a company that we\u2019ve got headwinds and so what we\u2019ve been trying to do of course is you have got to find other levers to pull. And so as Tim said, he is looking at is very hard to make sure he is doing what he needs to do and if there is an opportunity to turn some things up to get more money to the bottom-line that\u2019s what we\u2019re attempting to do. And we\u2019ll continue to disclose that each quarter so that you can follow and track those changes.","Mark Connelly","That\u2019s really helpful.","Mark S. Sutton","Mark this is Mark Sutton. Just the first question you asked, just to tie it back to an earlier question around how we run our system. That incremental capacity capability that\u2019s coming from these investments as Tim mentioned, is really about making some products differently that we\u2019ve made before, making our system more flexible meaning we can make similar products at the same mill or different so we can improve our supply chains.","So the issue of capacity coming online is only when and if need it for the demand environment. It\u2019s really the driver is really making more of this and less of that for the boxes that we need to make going forward and as an outcome as improving those facilities, we have more capacity if we need more capacity.","So that\u2019s kind of a way to think about that as appose to business coming on at this date and this is coming on at that date. It\u2019s coming on as a new product, a new basis weight, a new design. And net capacity comes on if we have the orders for it. it doesn\u2019t come on if we don\u2019t have the orders for it.","Mark Connelly","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays.","John Dunigan","This is actually John Dunigan filling in for Scott Gaffner. Good morning and congrats on a strong quarter.","Mark S. Sutton","Thank you.","John Dunigan","Most of my questions, unfortunately, have been asked, but I did just have a couple. In particular, I wanted to ask about what you guys are seeing in the OCC prices and how the lower inputs have had an impact on your first quarter and then what you're expecting in terms of an outlook going forward for that and how it could affect IP?","W. Michael Amick","Yes I mean, I think our forecast is that we could see some modest pressure in OCC pricing as we go through the second quarter. we don't expect it at this point to be a major factor and yes in the first quarter input is little bit of the tailwind for us which we're operating in a certain environment and trying to take advantage of environment that we have.","John Dunigan","Okay. And some of your peers had discussed some of the freight benefits that they have been enjoying, particularly getting some discounts and even building up on some inventory to meet some just in time demand. Could you just touch upon what IP's seeing in terms of those costs and how you guys are maybe taking advantage, particularly in your Industrial and Packaging sector?","W. Michael Amick","Well, I think part of what you've seen just in - what we've seen in terms of our supply chain network is rail and truck availability has improved dramatically in the last part of last year, early this year compared to where we were say year ago. So that's obviously having an impact on the discussions you have with carriers about rate structures, it\u2019s still a very challenged environment in some cases, in terms of those discussions, but we think we're having some measures of traction as we have those discussions.","The bigger impact in the moment is just what it means to how we think about our stocking position across 200 plus facilities and its meaning at the movement that we need less inventory and we can run much more efficiency supply chain. So there is benefiting. That I think what we have worried about is how it changes overtime and will there be a snap back of utilization rates around carriers later this year","John Dunigan","And you generally think in the near term here that you can still enjoy the benefits, with possibly a snap back late this year or maybe early next year?","W. Michael Amick","I don't know when it's going to happen or if it will happen. I just know the thing don\u2019t say that people take actions and so we don't count on anything lasting. I think it goes back to the power of the system, we have tremendous flexibility and we're trying to create more flexibility through these investments. So that we can pull back when we need to and we can recover quickly when we need to.","John Dunigan","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones","Hi Good morning.","W. Michael Amick","Good morning Debbie.","Debbie Jones","I was wondering if you could talk about the change you made to your management incentive plan in early February. It looks like you switched it up based on 50% operating cash flows to 50% EBITDA, with ROIC being the remainder. Is there anything we should read into that about your cash operating expenses in the coming years?","Mark S. Sutton","Hi Debbie this is Mark. Well I think what we're attempting to do there, cash flow is still front in center. What we've got is that particular annual plan is focused on the majority of our employee, who are running on operation that's a level and type of job and we all talk of EBITDA in the company that's plans are based on, it\u2019s what people are measured on. And we've had little bit of slippage in our EBITDA progress over the last couple of years.","so just an attempt to be focused and the overall scheme of things obviously cash from ops, start with a good strong EBITDA and then you go to the cash flow, free cash flow and your capital allocation strategy is clearly understood, commitment to the dividend. So no message other than focusing the people who are actually on that plan to look at ways we can improved our EBITDA and break through the flat nature of it over the last couple of years. So that's one plan for one year for certain group of employees.","Debbie Jones","Can I just ask, do you still expect no pension contribution in 2016 and 2017?","Carol L. Roberts","Debbie, what I would say is we have no required pension contribution for 2016 and 2017. Now how we go forward you know we will obviously navigate that as we move forward.","Debbie Jones","Okay. And my last question, I just wanted to ask, we talk a lot about the substitution potential from craft liner to recycled liner and whether or not there's room to go, given the sustainably low OCC prices. And you see this from both vantage points, having exposure to both markets. I was wondering if you could comment on this, and then also how this might impact your longer term capacity plans.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes, hey Debbie its Tim. We see in certain regions in certain areas there is either more or less competition from certain type of product range. I think the way we think about it is we're looking with our customers that best fit and best used for the packaging they need and it includes a variety of substrates, some virgin, some recycled fit for use.","But it also includes capability, geography, service levels and so we're selling them more than just it recycled or is it virgin, we're selling them a total product and we've got breadth of product to do it like no others. So there is always going to be a competition, it\u2019s very competitive market, but we feel good about the value propositions we have.","Debbie Jones","And then the question about the capacity plans in the future, just thinking about the tonnage that you're adding in the coming years.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes, I don\u2019t want to speculate on what we will do or won\u2019t do. We\u2019ve got lowest OCC input cost at the moment, it\u2019s a moment in time we think it is probably a different trend overtime and we\u2019ll make decisions. It\u2019s like I talked about these capacity additions, we\u2019re not just adding generic tonnes, we\u2019re adding products and grades and basis weights for where we see growth in our channels and the types of products that we need to support that growth.","So and then we run it accordingly as we\u2019ve said to what our demand is. So we constantly look at what are those products, what do they need to be, where should we add them and it will be an ongoing evaluation?","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thanks very much. Good luck for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Manuel","Good morning and congratulations for a great start to the year.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Thanks Chris.","Christopher Manuel","Two topics I wanted to touch on. First, a little bit more around - you are probably tired of talking about it, but some of the dynamics here with North American containerboard, and the second topic being Ilim. With respect to the first topic, I hear how you have answered Debbie and Mark's and a few others' questions around things. But if I look to downtime you took in 4Q and 1Q, one quarter doesn't make a trend, but it's now been two in a row that it's been solidly north of 200,000 tonnes. If we annualize that, that's larger than a machine, close to a mill, 900-ish thousand tons on an annual basis of downtime, market downtime. You also referenced you had some inventories coming down. So maybe you could help us, give us a sense as to when I look at industry inventories - they haven't really moved much the last few months, but maybe yours has. Could you give us a sense, maybe either in tonnes or in weeks supply or however you think about it, your inventories have changed 3Q to 4Q to 1Q?","W. Michael Amick","I would say we run a very tight supply chain year around and we make adjustments as we go. So no I am not going to breakout tonnes or weeks of supply. I\u2019m just going to say that we\u2019re constantly looking at four-months to five-months in advance targeting where we think we need based on our demand signal and then we make adjustments as we run the system.","So the downtime that we took in the fourth quarter and first quarter a very large component of that, goes back to supply chain efficiencies and just not needing as much inventory to our chain. That could change overtime and may be we\u2019re taking a little bit of risk on the downside in terms of how it might change and what we might do to be able to do to respond to it, but we just like to run a very tight supply chain and we\u2019ll continue to do so.","Christopher Manuel",": So if I read into that a little, it sounds like your inventory levels over the last couple quarters have come down a good chunk then and they're not flat.","W. Michael Amick","No, they are not flat and a lot of things go into targeting inventory levels, we run hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of grades, 200 locations and so we\u2019re looking product-by-product basis grades, locations and stocking levels across all of this and then we are adjusting the system quarterly. And if it just takes less time to get product from mill-to-box plan, because the velocity has increased and we obviously don\u2019t need as much inventory in the system.","Christopher Manuel","Okay. Thank you. And with respect to Ilim, I've read several places it looks like you're going to do a pretty sizable expansion there. Could you maybe give us a little color as to what's happening in timing and things of that nature, and as well as while that's going on, what we would probably expect out of - would dividends stop for a while or how might that work?","Mark S. Sutton","So Chris on the Ilim release that you are referencing they put out a five-year plan and it was a capital plan to improve the business. A big portion of that is inclusive of their normal maintenance and regulatory CapEx that\u2019s about $325 million annually. So the incremental that was in that announcement over that five-year period was about $700 million and its planned only if the project are developed and as they have the right returns to improve the current business that they have and to improve the quality of the product and its necessary to make more product at the second facility.","And the plan for that would be to organize the funding in the same way the prior development of Ilim was done which is on the Ilim balance sheet and we don\u2019t see any effect on the dividend changing or going down or the things like that. So we think there is some good opportunities of improving Ilim. And it goes to that comment I made on my closing statement around making products that are needed in the market, mainly into consumer oriented end-users and making them in the right price in the world for your advantage, fiber, cost structure and work force and this is a perfect example of that.","Carol L. Roberts","And Chris I\u2019ll just add on. We actually are going to get a dividend payment, I\u2019m looking at my colleague who is on the - cards around the board is Ilim joint venture last week approved the dividend payment for 2016. So we will receive a $50 million between $50 million to $55 million this year and another recommitment to the dividend flow out of the business given that its generating significant cash and also if you look at their debt balance, their debt has actually come down as well. So the financial condition of that business is great and we're counting on dividend out of that business as part of the value creation equation for International Paper.","Christopher Manuel","Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Mark S. Sutton","Thank you Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon","Yes and good morning.","W. Michael Amick","Good morning Chip.","Chip Dillon","I just wanted to make sure I understood. You gave a lot of moving parts earlier in the call. And I know you said that the price impact of mainly pulp would be about, on the North American Paper business, would be somewhere around $20 million. But then I think you said that there's a benefit in Brazil of about $10 million. So I guess for that segment, looking at just pricing, the difference would be just $10 million, is that right, negative?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, those are two distinct items that we called out. So that would be the right way to look at Chip.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And just so I understand, on the slides, it looks like the total benefit from less maintenance in the second quarter, I think adds up to $42 million, but then you called out some other $30 million swing from operations. Could you just clarify that, please?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, Chip, I think what I called out was 22 on total outage expense from first to second.","Chip Dillon","Okay.","Carol L. Roberts","So, I'm not sure where the number that you said. What we did called out is Riegelwood was a big driver, but if you added all up, if you go all the way across the line there and add it all up, it's a $22 million improvement first to second.","Chip Dillon","Got you, okay.","Carol L. Roberts","And the second part of your question, I'm not sure, I the second part of your question then still has application.","Chip Dillon","Yes, the operations, I think you said there were some $30 million benefit from just operations that you referred to.","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, the second quarter is always a better operations quarter than the first, it\u2019s not as cold, we just we have lot behind you, generally a good operational quarter for lots of reasons and we anticipate that to happen.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned, I think this is very apropos, given the opportunity in Madrid, and you say you have a lot of exposure in the fruit, vegetable area. My understanding is that most or all of the fruits and vegetables need to be packaged in virgin-based craft liner because of the condensation issue. And has technology changed to allow certain types of recycled board to be introduced there? Is there any kind of a change that has taken place or is taking place? And then is that, in part, behind your move in Madrid?","Mark S. Sutton","No the move in Madrid is really to complement what we do with craft liner and your assessment is accurate. I mean there has been lots of attempts to make products with mixed substrate in that field, it really, really is driven by the supply chain, there are probably some short supply chains that care different products. But the humidity from the harvest, all the way through the supply chain to the market, is what drives the performance characteristics of fresh food packaging for meeting craft liner or craft like performance characteristics.","The industrial business, the high end industrial business that complements your mix in your plant, because obviously agriculture seasonally, and you want to run your plant and run a successful business over the year. That's where the high performance lightweight recycled comes in and it allows us to perform better in some of the best industrial segment versus using board that is not that high performance, it\u2019s got to use more of it and things with that nature. We end up not being competitive in the industrial segment that you really want to be in.","Chip Dillon","That makes lot of sense. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Danny Moran of Macquarie.","Danny Moran","Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to clarify something on your heat map that you provided in your earnings presentation. Do you anticipate continued higher year-over-year export shipments in 2Q and for the year? And then do you also expect further price erosion to the export markets?","W. Michael Amick","Hi, Dan, I'm assuming you are talking about container board. Yes, I mean we feel pretty good about the demand signal that we've gotten from the market, margins take a hit, demands seems to be holding up, which that to us, there is a need for the type of product that we're supplying to the export markets and we've been a strategic supplier to those markets for decade. So we have long-term relationship that we stick with quarter-to-quarter, year-in, year-out.","We feel pretty good about our backlog for the second quarter, the market is very competitive, I don't want to forecast price, but I just leave that it's competitive and the types of erosion that we've seen probably continue into the quarter. So we'll manage it accordingly, but we still make decent money on export and we like it a lot on average through the cycle.","Danny Moran","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then one last one from me. With all the moving parts in your North American Industrial Packaging business, with economic downtime and some capacity creep, on a net basis do you expect to produce more or less boxes this year?","W. Michael Amick","Well, I'm not going to forecast what we will produce, we've said that overtime our goal is that we position ourselves with the right segments and with the right customers and we would expect to perform in line with market as our choices around customer mix grow overtime. And we\u2019ve seen a little bit of both here over the past year, last year we were underperforming because of some of that exposure and in the first quarter of this year we were right on top of it. So to us it\u2019s about customer choices and how we align ourselves in the right spots.","Danny Moran","Got it. Okay. Thanks and good luck for the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over o Jay Royalty for any closing remarks.","Jay Royalty","Sorry Brandy I was jumping on a little. Well that\u2019s all the time we had today folks. Thanks for joining and as always, Mitchell and I are available after the call. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

And we will open up for your questions after today\u2019s prepared remarks.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Jay Royalty to begin. Please go ahead, sir.","Jay Royalty","Thanks, Maria, and good morning everyone. And thank you for joining International Paper\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Incoming Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings press release and today\u2019s presentation slides.","Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint venture\u2019s financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning four our call. Before I get into the slides, I wanted to acknowledge that while, as Jay mentioned, Glenn is joining me to review our results and outlook this morning. Carol is also here with us, in the room along with other members of the senior leadership team at International Paper.","So, I\u2019m on Slide 5, make some opening comments. Before we go through the quarter and full year results, I wanted to make a couple of comments about the incident we had at the Pensacola Mill last week. And first and foremost, we are very thankful that no one was injured in this incident. Our priority is on the health and safety of our colleagues, contractors that work with us and the residence of the community.","We\u2019re doing everything we can to help restore the surrounding community and get things back in normal as quickly as possible. I\u2019d like to thank everyone involved for their extraordinary efforts and commitment over the past couple of weeks. Glenn will provide more details later on the call for his impact and our outlook for Pensacola.","So, as we go back to the content of Slide 5, International Paper delivered another year of strong performance with free cash flow of $1.9 billion and return on invested capital of about 10%, nicely exceeding our cost of capital.","We made substantial progress on many fronts. Further strengthening our North American Industrial Packaging business, we completed the acquisition of the Weyerhaeuser pulp business in December, which we have combined with IP\u2019s legacy pulp business to form our new Global Cellulose Fibers business.","We converted a machine at the Riegelwood mill from Coated Paperboard capability to fluff pulp, which gives us the capacity to grow both plus and high value specialties pulp products within the larger more capable new Cellulose Fibers platform. In Europe, we acquired a top quartile mill asset in Madrid which we will convert later this year to light weight high performance recycled containerboard to support our European box business.","And finally, we finalized the sale of our Asia Industrial Packaging converting business, further focusing on strengthening the IP portfolio. On the capital allocation front, our board of directors authorized 5% increase in IP\u2019s annual dividend, moving it to $1.85 a share, in making at the fifth consecutive year of a dividend increase.","While 2016 didn\u2019t play out exactly how we had envisioned a year ago as we were sitting here talking about the year. I feel good about what we accomplished and how we executed in a pretty tough global environment. As we go through the call today and outlined where we are now and the key catalyst that we have for 2017. We have line of sight to grow our EBITDA this year by 10%.","So on Slide 6, and turning to the full year financial results. Just talk a bit about a few of the metrics. The majority of the revenue decline, if you see on this slide, is attributable to the sales of the Sun JV and the Asia box business, as well as the sale of our Coated Bristols brand and that business.","Lower earnings were primarily due to margin pressure across most of our businesses through most of 2016, along with escalating input costs in the latter portion of the year. We did see signs of strengthening in some of our key markets in the second half of the year, which enabled us to announce and implement a number of price increases across various businesses that will all benefit us in 2017. Debt levels were increased to 2016, primarily to fund the pulp acquisition. And as we\u2019ve commented on previously, our priority in 2017 broking debt reduction.","Moving to Slide 7, I\u2019d be continued to strong and sustainable \u2013 strong trend for sustainable free cash flow in 2016. This gave us the horsepower to execute our strategy creating value for our shareholders.","Moving to Slide 8, we also delivered another strong year of return on invested capital, solidly above our cost of capital. This is our second consecutive year within ROIC spread to our weighted average cost of capital more than 200 basis points, and seventh straight years of ROIC above our cost of capital.","I\u2019m going to now turn it over to Glenn, and ask him to cover the performance across our businesses, as well as provide an update on the balance sheet and our outlook. Glenn?","Glenn Landau","Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone. It\u2019s great to be here. Let me just begin by extending my sincere thanks and enormous congratulations to Carol Roberts, who is sitting here beside me as she used closure of this chapter of her professional life and [indiscernible].","And as I know I can speak to so many of you here in the room and across the company, as well as many on the line today, you have a made a different for International Paper have positively impacted so many of our senior leadership support. So Carol, all the best.","Now, back to business. I\u2019m on Slide 9, which is about full year operating EPS Bridge from 2015 to 2016. As Mark already shared year-over-year earnings were impacted by price erosion and weaker mix across many of our businesses this past year, driving a $0.70 unfavorable swing versus 2015 levels.","Biggest movers were containerboard for export, global pulp and boxes in the North America, which decline modestly for the first three quarters of the year largely precipitated by the January 2015 index increase, all prior to our implementation of our October box price increases late in the fourth quarter.","Volume of the net positive for the year, primarily function of improving North American box demand. Operation quite solid and improving performance across our mill system we\u2019re drag on earning in the year have been impacted by several items including our Riegelwood fluff pulp conversion to ramp up, Hurricane Matthew and a significant non-cash LIFO inventory reevaluation associated with our October containerboard increase implementation.","And while lower input costs were tailwind for much of the year driving a net positive, we saw meaningful shift in that trend over the last few months of 2016 as many inputs began to turn high we\u2019ll get more into that later in the call as we speak to the outlook.","So moving across the bridge, a lower effective tax rate and interest expense combined for a dime of improvement and Ilim contributed to the positive largely driven by FX. And lastly earnings associated with our acquisition of Weyerhaeuser\u2019s pulp business in the month of December at $0.03 to the year.","Now turning to Slide 10, International Paper delivered solid results in the fourth quarter supported by increasing box demand and higher prices of containerboard and boxes in our North American Industrial Packaging business. This all against the backdrop though of fallen pulp prices and rising input costs primarily OCC and energy.","On the operations of cost front c,ontinued solid mill performance was unfavorably impacted by seasonality and where I mean by that is higher consumption of energy in raw materials associated with colder temperatures. As well as a handful of non-repeating items including the impact of Hurricane Matthew, our year-end LIFO inventory reevaluation, as I mentioned in the previous slide, and as well as higher expenses related medical claims in the quarter. All of which if you remember from our third quarter call, we\u2019re expected in part of our outlook.","Further, the Ilim JV delivered another strong quarter of results with operational EBITDA of $180 million. And strategically, we close the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser\u2019s pulp business marking the beginning of our newly combined Global Cellulose Fibers business segment of which the integration is opt to a great start and we\u2019re delighted to welcome 2,000 new colleagues to the IP team creating the preeminent Global Cellulose Fibers business in dynamic and growing space, the long runway of value creation so more to come on now.","The quarter-over-quarter bridge on Slide 11, depicts what I just said, higher prices for containerboard and boxes in North America Industrial Packaging were offset by lower prices \u2013 lower pulp prices and IP\u2019s legacy pulp business. And despite four fewer shipping days for North America box shipments, volume was flat sequentially due to a higher daily demand for boxes of 5% in the quarter, which was really meaningful.","Operations and other costs were down $0.18 quarter-over-quarter, about a half of which was due to seasonality mainly higher energy consumption and the other half due to non-repeating items as I described on the previous slide. If this were a headwind and OCC continue to escalate as we expecting the quarter.","Turning to the businesses, and starting with industrial packaging on Slide 12, initial benefits of the price increase were realized as expected in the quarter. Domestic containerboard increase was fully implemented up to the $40 index moved and North America box prices were up $4 per ton on average quarter-over-quarter.","Volume was strong but higher containerboard exports and the better and expected daily box demand rate only partially offset the impact of four fewer shipping days though. In operations and other costs are largest business that the blunt of the previously mentioned non-repeating items and input costs were higher with OCC accounting for half of the total impact with an increasing trend driving a higher exit rate than average in the quarter.","The next Slide on 13 is intended to provide some additional color on how we are thinking about 2017 full year benefits associated with the October 2016 domestic containerboard and price increase. Starting with the upper left hand portion of slide, you can see that IP has roughly 10 million tons that are within the scope of this announced increase. 9 million tons of U.S. integrated box business and about 1 million tons of domestic containerboard sales.","So the simple math here, given the $40 expectation I referenced earlier, is about $400 million annualized. While we expect to realize $400 million in absolute terms, there are several factors to consider relative to the year-over-year earnings impact.","Moving your attention to the graph on the top right, and factoring initial benefits we saw in the fourth quarter, year-over-year exit rate U.S. box prices remain below fourth quarter 2015 levels. As we report quarterly in the appendix, North American box prices on average are down $18 per ton versus the fourth quarter 2015. Largely due to the impacts related to the $15 per ton index reset in early 2015 and normal erosion we see prior to our October increase.","So, roughly half of the expected increase benefit essentially goes to price restoration and, considering the rising OCC cost escalation trend, another material portion of the increase just covers this headwind. All that said, the increase execution is moving along smoothly and we expect full implementation by the end of the first quarter.","Okay, now on Slide 14, I\u2019d like to turn to our newly combined business, Global Cellulose Fibers, which beginning with this fourth quarter release will be reported on a standalone business segment. As you can see on the map the combined business has a solid fleet of mills strategically positioned across the southeast U.S. along with a couple of specialized processing facilities in Mississippi and Poland.","In addition we have acquired a highly capable and competitive northern softwood craft mill in Alberta, Canada. So in total, IP\u2019s Global Cellulose Fibers business has a combined 3.6 million tons of capacity for softwood and fluff pulp, as well as other specialties applications and is extremely well positioned to serve our global customers in these attractive and growing segments.","Looking forward, given our current fixed utilization depicted in the pie chart in the top right, there are significant product mix upgrade opportunities to fluff and our specialty products, as well as installed incremental fluff capacity post our Riegelwood conversion to grow with our customers\u2019 increasing demand. So, with this exciting combination, IP could not be better positioned to take advantage of this very attractive global markets.","On Slide 15, just as some background, I\u2019m taking a closer look at global fluff pulp markets, we have a nice mix of both established and higher growth emerging markets geographically and a wide range of products with different levels of maturity in the marketplace.","So for example, North America and Western Europe continue to grow in line with expecting population trends while emerging markets like Asia, Latin America and the Middle East will drive most of the growth rate expected to be 4%. Primary applications for fluff pulp are spread between baby diapers, feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products and with our additional capabilities of the Weyerhaeuser system, we have the technical and human resources, as well as the manufacturing capacity, to drive innovation and product development in to other high value specialties in the pulp space that will provide further growth opportunities beyond those reflected here.","Okay, turning to Slide 16, and taking a look at our pro forma results for the combined business, there was a significant reduction in earnings from 2015 to 2016. This was primarily due to two factors. One was the costs associated with the Riegelwood conversion and ramp-up in our Legacy business, which amounted to roughly $80 million in 2016. The other is price and mix erosion which was experienced evenly across both Legacy businesses as both softwood and fluff prices came under pressure in 2016.","Further, IP saw the negative mix impact associated with Riegelwood capacity which ramped up our market softwood pulp in the second half of 2016 as we were working toward fluff qualification with our customers. So a negative mix effect there.","The outlook for 2017 is a mix of both favorable and timing related unfavorable items with a slants to positive. To the upside we have expected demand growth, the synergy opportunities, and our recently announced price increases for softwood and fluff pulp products. But, clearly exit rate prices for 2016 were lower than average prices for the year and the large extended average in capital investment project underway at the Port Wentworth mill had a significant cost impact in the quarter.","With that said, this large project to upgrade the recovery boiler, turbine and power system at the mill has attractive energy savings benefits and we\u2019ll enjoy those, following completion, for years to come.","On 17, back to the integration, you can see the synergy opportunity and associated timeline for realization of the newly combined businesses. There are three major buckets of synergies, overhead, commercial mix improvement, which are both fluff and specialty opportunities, and a large bucket of manufacturing, supply chain and sourcing opportunities that we will leverage.","Looking at the chart on the right, you can see the expected ramp-up and run rate targets for year end 2017 and 2018. We expect a run rate of $100 million in synergies by the end of this year adding approximately $50 million to earnings for 2017. One-time costs will be treated as special items and are expected to be around $85 million of which about half were expense from December and the balance will be spread over this year and next, all will be treated as special items as I just said. Related to synergies, we know how to do this. We\u2019ve done it before. The teams are off an running, have line of sight to the target and we\u2019ll work hard to exceed expectations.","Turning now to the consumer packaging business on Slide 18. We had a light quarter as we saw continued price pressure in elements of the folding carton segment and on plate stock along with seasonally lower volume. Operations were as expected, but costs were higher due to seasonality. Planned maintenance averages were also higher given the plan [indiscernible] average.","Now moving to Printing Papers, Slide 19. As we said earlier, given the new Cellulose Fibers segment, reporting for paper beginning this quarter will no longer include pulp. In terms of results, price mix was impacted primarily by higher export sales out of North America. However we experienced good volume mainly due seasonally stronger volume in Brazil.","Operations and costs were negatively impacted by a challenging operational quarter at a couple of our European mills, Hurricane Matthew in North America, and seasonably higher operating costs and higher medical claims in the quarter that I mentioned earlier. Planned maintenance outage expenses were higher in the quarter and we experienced some unfavorable FX impacts in Brazil due to the strengthening house.","Now moving to Ilim on Slide 20, the JV had another strong quarter capped off what we consider a great year. All three mills set production records for both periods, the quarter and the year, and strong demand primarily in China led to higher sales volume in the fourth quarter with total volume up a little over 5% for the full year.","Looking to the first quarter, JV expects modest pulp price improvement to be more than offset by normal seasonality, resulting in lower sales volume and higher input costs primarily wood. Additionally, the board of directors at the JV has authorized a cash dividend to be distributed in March of which IP will receive $100 million.","Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 21, IP experienced a step up in leverage ratios in 2016 as you can see, primarily due to increased debt taken to facilitate the pulp business acquisition but also impacted lower EBITDA performance. Our pension gap decreased by $200 million as we made voluntary contributions totaling $750 million in the year, some of which was offset by a 30 basis point decline in discount rate by the end of the year.","However, the discount rate did improve significantly in the fourth quarter as we exited the year versus prior quarter trend, so really better than it could have been. The additional debt taken on this year largely to fund the acquisition, was done [indiscernible] tranches at an average interest rate of 0.7%. Our plan as we work to pay down debt to restore leverage ratios in line with our target within the next two years will be to take out new debt.","Okay, matrix and before I speak to the specifics regarding outlook for the first quarter, I\u2019d note that given the evolving situation at Pensacola, our matrix does not reflect any of the impacts associated with the mill interruption but I will speak more to that following this slide.","So back on Slide 22, starting with price and specifically we expect to see significant benefits from implementation of the North America price increase in both domestic containerboard and U.S. box in the range of about $70 million.","For volume, additional shipping days in North America will be largely offset by a lower daily shipping rate and we expect earnings from the additional volume from the first full quarter of the acquisition in Cellulose Fibers to also be offset by normal seasonal decline in Brazil, so net-net, flattish in this volume bucket.","Within operations and costs, the non-repeats of the impact from the one-off items from the fourth quarter, remember the hurricane, LIFO, and medical claims, are expected to be a benefit of $30 million for packaging and $20 million for papers in the coming quarter.","So the red that jumps off the page are our plans \u2013 our underlined plans, maintenance outage expenses in the quarter, which would be $102 million higher sequentially, so really just timing along with the addition of outages associated with our expanded Cellulose Fibers business.","Input costs are expected to increase primarily across North American operations by $40 million versus the fourth quarter driven largely by OCC and natural gas. And finally, relative of a couple of the items in the other categories, we\u2019re expecting a higher tax rate in Q1 around 33%, so back to a more normalized level. And results at the Ilim JV are expected to be lower primarily due to seasonally lower volume and seasonally higher input costs.","So, turning to Slide 23, let me provide a brief update on the Pensacola mills digester incident which occurred on the evening of Sunday, January 22, and for those of you not familiar with the digester, it\u2019s a large pressurized vessel that cooks wood chips, turning wood chips in to un-bleached Cellulose Fiber.","And relative to this incident, the vessel \u2013 the digester vessel failed, causing separation of its top and associated damage to the adjacent powerhouse due to flying debris. At the instant of the failure, the pressurized content within the digester, primarily raw pulp, water, and pulping mister, were released to the surrounding areas. Thankfully not a single person at the mill was injured.","And of course, our immediate response was to ensure the health and safety of our employees, contractors, and neighbors, in and around the site. We accomplished this and shortly after, the following day, a unified command was formed including representatives from the Escambia County Health Department, the Florida Department Environmental Protection, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as well as International Paper. The unified command took full control and led the development and execution of plans to clean the impacted areas and to address community concerns.","At this point, we have already made significant progress on the cleanup and will not stop until the area is restored. In terms of our progress towards bringing the mill back to an a operating state, earlier this week we restarted the powerhouse and resumed partial operations of the pulp line, which is supported by a different set of smaller batch digesters.","Today we continue to ramp up production of fluff pulp and expect to be fully online by the weekend. Relative to containerboard though, repairing the damage continuous digester will take some time. And while we\u2019re working toward a firm estimate, what we do know now is that startup will not take place in the first quarter. So, we\u2019ll continue to use our extensive containerboard mill network to meet customer needs over the next several weeks.","As you can appreciate, just 10 days post the incident, it is difficult to estimate the full financial impact, as well as the timeline associated with this situation. With that said, we know there will be major costs incurred. In this quarter and beyond and at this point we expect the total impact to be in excess of $50 million.","This will not be a special item. But we do have property damage and business interruption insurance that we expect will cover a significant portion of the costs. Relative to our insurance, we will have a deductible up to $20 million which you can say, essentially, that\u2019s a cap on our exposure.","With that said, timing of the insurance recovery will be uneven and there will likely be some lag associated with getting our claims covered. Net-net we see this all trued up by year end.","Finally, the changer digester, which was the primary equipment impacted, is fully depreciated so no write-off will come with at least this primary piece of equipment. So, given the evolving nature of the situation, we commit and plan to provide a more specific estimate of timing and costs publicly before the end of the quarter, so more to come on this.","Lastly on Slide 24, here we have some of the key financial metrics we normally provide to build a picture of our planning assumptions for 2017. CapEx will be higher at around $1.5 billion which includes the expanded Cellulose Fibers business, approximately $100 million of the delta, as well as the mill conversion in Madrid.","We expect 2017 depreciation also to be up to roughly $1.4 billion including $140 million of depreciation carried over from the recently acquired pulp assets. Interest expense is impacted by our hard debt profile and corporate items and our effective tax rate will stay within normalized levels into 2017 based on what we know today. Also given the escalating input cost backdrop, we have included our current view relative to this impact year-over-year in the range of about $180 million to $200 million higher in 2017.","And as this item we see this as directional only as we note that there\u2019s more likely incremental risk as many of these items are already looking to be pushing the upper end of the range.","So with that, I will turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, Glenn. What I\u2019d like to do on the last slide of our prepared remarks is wrap up with our focus for 2017. We expect, as I mentioned earlier, to continue the trend of strong cash generation and returns above our cost of capital. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, given what we know today and the catalyst we have in play, we have line of sight to grow full year EBITDA by 10%.","We have great opportunity to integrate our newly acquired pulp business, drive synergies and improve our overall mix. The acquisition brings us great people, best in class assets, and second to none capabilities. Together with IP\u2019s business, we\u2019ll create significant value for our customers and shareholders over time.","We expect higher earnings in our North American Industrial Packaging business, due to benefits from the previously announced price increase, growing demand from our customers, and our own internal improvement initiatives. We also expect to improve margins with continued strong operations and extensive cost reduction efforts across many of our other businesses.","Everything is on track for our planned conversion of the Madrid mill in the second half of the year, which will enable a better offering for our customers and earnings improvement for our European Industrial Packaging business. The Ilim JV is well positioned for another strong year of performance.","And with the strong free cash flow that comes from all of this, we\u2019ll continue to allocate capital to create value with a near-term focus on debt reduction. I feel good about how International Paper\u2019s positioned and the opportunities we have in front of us that we\u2019re working on.","And with that, like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning and best wishes to Carol and Glenn in your transitions. In terms of box shipments I was wondering if you\u2019d give us color on how those trended in the first weeks of January, and then given the outage in Pensacola, I was wondering if you could talk about how comfortable you are with your inventory levels? And if you could give any additional color on what steps you\u2019re taking in your system to meet customer needs.","Tim Nicholls","Hi, Anthony. It\u2019s Tim. On box shipments, January was pretty strong for us. We don\u2019t have final numbers just yet, but absolute we think will be somewhere between 4% and 5% and roughly flat on the daily. So everything that we saw in the fourth quarter kind of continued over into January. In terms of Pensacola, obviously, first of all, we\u2019re fortunate that we\u2019ve got such a great team and we\u2019ve got such a really good manufacturing system for containerboards.","So we\u2019ve got one mill down. Our inventories, I think, we had told you in the fourth quarter, were tight and we\u2019re already managing a very complicated supply chain. Having said that, we\u2019ve got tremendous flexibility in the system we have. And so we\u2019re looking at all our options as to how we accommodate the capacity that we need and make sure we keep our customers with product. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a problem in the first quarter.","So, we\u2019re lean and we\u2019re running hard but I think we\u2019ve got a lot of options around the other 15 mills in the United States to make sure that we\u2019re meeting all of our commitments.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then regarding the first quarter outlook for Cellulose Fibers, you\u2019ve got a headwind from higher outages and some higher costs but you\u2019ve got also the Weyerhaeuser acquisition and price hikes and synergies. I guess my question is, would you expect that business to be profitable in the first quarter or maybe closer to break even following the loss in 4Q?","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras","Hi, Jean-Michel speaking. We expect it to break even for Q1, that are very heavy outage quarter. So, that, except with the \u2013 that cut out. Despite all of the positive things going on \u2013 to be around I would say break even.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of BMO.","Mark Wilde","Good morning. First question is just, if you look at where you stand at the end of the first quarter, from a price cost standpoint in the containerboard business, the benefit of the autumn hike and then the increase and kind of costs that we\u2019ve seen over the last six to nine months, are you going to be ahead or behind where you were, say, last spring?","Tim Nicholls","Hey Mark, it\u2019s Tim. We\u2019ll be behind from a margin standpoint, I think price increase, as we exit the first quarter, will probably have 85% to 90% of the price increase implemented and we expect a full realization, the offset obviously is the pressure that we\u2019ve seen with input cost.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right and then as a follow up, I just have a trade question. I just noticed that Brazil has raised its import duties on fluff pulp from 4% to 14%. It looks to me like this is an attempt to allow [indiscernible] in the kind of ramp up its new fluff pulp mill and enter the fluff market. And I just wonder from kind of a trade standpoint, is there anything you can do about this?","You\u2019re the biggest pulp producer in the world and it seems like the government down there is just trying to help kind of the Brazilian producers enter this market, by kind of providing them a closed market for a little while with this tariff.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras","We just learned about that tariff. So, we\u2019re just trying to clearly understand why and how it\u2019s affecting us [indiscernible]. I understand your concern in general, we are more for fair trading and free exchange. Don\u2019t know exactly what are their motivation with \u2013 from that one. I understand your comment I think.","Mark Wilde","Yes, I guess, my point is just \u2013 you\u2019ve tied a lot of capital up in the fluff pulp business and this is pretty clearly an attempt kind of prime the pump for some new entrance.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras","For us it\u2019s not a big market in top of that in Latin America. So, just specifically if you asked us to -- we\u2019re not expecting a big impact on the [indiscernible] So I understand on the context. But on the reality of the numbers, it\u2019s [indiscernible] a very, very small impact.","Mark Wilde","Okay, great. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. I just wanted to follow up to make sure I understood, Tim, your comment that margins would be lower at the end of the quarter, going out of this quarter, than they had been last spring. That puzzled me a little bit. Maybe you could just clarify. I assume what you were talking was that the impact of the prices falling at the beginning of last year, combined with the cost inflation would offset or outweigh this single-pipe increase. I just wanted to make sure I understood what you\u2019re saying.","Tim Nicholls","Yes, I think that is right, Mark. Looking at it year-over-year you remember the price was published down in January. But that had a bit of a delay as it rolled in based on contracts. There\u2019s a lot of contracts that get impacted, and then we had more favorable input cost in the first part of last year than certainly we had at the end of last year and that\u2019s continued into the first quarter of this year.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. On Pensacola, just one clarification, too. Does the $50 million number you threw out there and for that matter of the way business insurance coverage would work. On the opportunity cost of tonnage that didn\u2019t get produce that you were making money on. Is that included in that 50 million and how would that get treated by insurance if at all?","Glenn Landau","Again that that $50 million is an estimate and that\u2019s a greater than $50 million, but to your question, Mark, this is Glenn, yes, business interruption, lost sales, mix, freight all those factors would be covered by insurance after the deductible.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng","Hey, guys. First off congrats Carol and Glenn in your new role and Carol it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. My first question was really around your 10% EBITDA growth target mark. Was that off of a pro forma base on an apples to apple bases with Weyerhaeuser acquisition and does that account for the impact from Pensacola?","Mark Sutton","Philip, hi. The 10% comment is including Weyerhaeuser, so that\u2019s one of the catalysts that I mentioned. And then the improvement in the rest of the company, those two put together, we have line of sight. I haven\u2019t factored in a big piece of Pensacola based on Glenn\u2019s comment on what we think it might end up being net, net given the insurance and all of that. But no, it was pre Pensacola and it included Weyerhaeuser.","Philip Ng","But just to be clear, the 10% base, 2017 versus 2016, does the 2016 number include Weyerhaeuser on a pro forma basis, or is that just\u2026","Mark Sutton","No, it\u2019s from an actual \u2013 closed on the deal in December so we didn\u2019t have any Weyerhaeuser number in our 2016 results. So, it includes Weyerhaeuser going forward.","Philip Ng","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess, on your consumer packaging business, I guess, there\u2019s been some continued pricing pressure on the folding carton side of things. Can you talk about that dynamic, how you\u2019re thinking about pricing going forward and are you starting to see that stabilize in light of potentially some concerns from imports on the FPB site? Thanks guys.","Cathy Slater","Hi, this is Catherine Slater. Clearly we\u2019re monitoring but this is the first year we actually have seen any meaningful decline in our ability to export, but overall with the changes we\u2019ve made internally with Riegelwood, we\u2019re very pleased with the mix we have and feel like we\u2019re very well positioned with our current footprint. And our focus will be really on what we can control which is operating wells, managing our costs and also meeting our customers expectation.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question and again best wishes to Glenn and Carol. Again, thankfully that no one was injured at Pensacola, but I wanted to ask some questions around that or a question around that. Can you talk about at this juncture what the lead times would be required to restore the continuous digester back to its pre incident state? And do you expect that on an interim basis you might be able to use some of the batch digesters that you use on the fluff line to produce Containerboard?","And then the related question would be, Tim, I think in answering one of the other questions, I forget who asked it, you said you should be able to fulfill customers\u2019 needs on products through the first quarter. Did that suggest that as the year progresses, if you maintain this level of progress as we get in to seasonally higher periods that you might have more challenges with that? I just want a little bit clarity on those two things. Thank you, guys.","Mark Sutton","Sure, first on the first part, you know, what Glenn covered earlier is really the estimate we have at the moment. We\u2019re pretty well convinced that we will not be starting back up in the first quarter, so the start up will fall outside. We\u2019ve got more work to do only being 10 or so days in to it.","George Staphos","Sure.","Tim Nicholls","Now, we feel comfortable with our exact estimate, but I think as we go through the quarter, we\u2019ll know that and we\u2019ll be able to update everyone accordingly when it happens. And to your question on batch, it\u2019s not our plan. Our focus is getting the continuous digester back up and getting the line back up the way it\u2019s configured to run. In terms of customers, you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t think we have any expectations at this point in customers in the first quarter.","A little hard not knowing exactly the estimate as we go out in to the second quarter, but at the moment I think we\u2019ll be okay. We\u2019ve got any number of options in terms of how we can manage the system and we\u2019re exploring all of those and starting to put plans in place. So I\u2019m pretty confident the team is going to respond very well and I think we will be in good shape. And if anything were to change in a material way of course we would update.","George Staphos","Tim, I appreciate that. If I could just ask a quick follow-on just for clarity, I mean, lead times on some of this equipment can\u2019t be three months, right, I mean, some of this would likely take a couple of quarters. Is that an inaccurate statement? Again, any color you can provide would be helpful. Thank you, guys. Good luck in the quarter.","Tim Nicholls","Yeah, I\u2019d just say for, I think the extent of the damage we have and those pieces of equipment I can\u2019t tell you when it will happen. I know it won\u2019t happen this quarter, but we don\u2019t have any indication that it\u2019s going to be in the second half of the year that we\u2019re still working on this. I think we\u2019ve got the ability to replace the equipment that was damaged in a shorter timeframe.","George Staphos","Understood; thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman of Roe Equity Research.","Gail Glazerman","Hi, good morning. Just going to ask \u2013 can you give some perspective on OCC, what you think has been driving it and are you seeing any signs of leveling off or stabilization?","Tim Nicholls","Hey, Gail, it\u2019s Tim. Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s a little bit difficult to know. I think some of the things you\u2019d look to be the usual suspects. China demand has been stronger. We do know that during the course of the last year, there were some disruptions in Chinese internal OCC recovery because of floods and production issues and other things.","So, here in the U.S., generation, [indiscernible] the issue and I know people have mentioned the impact of e-commerce and supply chain seeming more fragmented in terms of box collection recovery. I think the big question though, not knowing exactly where it will go as we leave the first quarter and go in to the second. The big question in my mind centers around China and how close they might be to practical recovery limits of internal OCC to the country. And if they are starting to bump up against that, then their OCC demand will have to be filled from other parts of the world.","Gail Glazerman","Okay, and just are you seeing it in the short-term? I think there have been some reports that China prices are kind of leveling off. Is that translating in to the U.S.?","Tim Nicholls","Well, we haven\u2019t seen anything as such. And you have to keep in mind, Chinese New Year and the impact. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know. There was fairly heavy buying, ahead of trends, and you\u2019ll have to see what happens when they come out of the holiday and machine starts starting up again.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And can you give us some broader perspective on demand; obviously you\u2019re seeing fourth quarter trends carry in to the first quarter but some broader perspective on what you\u2019re expecting in boxes for 2017? And maybe specifically touch on what you might be thinking about for California Ag in the short-term and medium-term just given all the weather out there?","Glenn Landau","Yeah, this is Glenn Landau. Certainly, the rain has helped. There were some pretty easy comps though. So you have to keep that in mind, but we saw a strong performance in our agricultural segment in the fourth quarter. No reason to believe that it won\u2019t be strong in 2017. Just from a segment standpoint, we also saw process foods recovering. Our fourth quarter was pretty good on that front. Protein, which after coming of a couple years of issued that various segments approaching were working through.","We saw the beginnings of recovery there as well. And so we\u2019re in the midst of updating models for 2017. I think everything we\u2019ve seen so far were still kind of in the 1%, 1.5% range and really haven\u2019t seen anything that would make us think it\u2019s going to be less than that.","Gail Glazerman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover of D.A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover","Thanks, good morning and congratulations everyone. First of all on Pensacola, we understand that Containerboard is offline for the first quarter, but given the margins are better in the Containerboard. Could you run the machine slow motion with the batch digesters in the long run or is it just too much of a mismatch in machine size?","Tim Nicholls","Well, I\u2019m not technical expert, but I think there\u2019d be a lot of plumbing and rerouting of things. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the most efficient thing for us to do. The best thing for us to do is focus on getting the fluff line up and running. We have commitments to customers that Jean-Michel could talk about, so we\u2019re going to work on that as priority and then get the continuous digester up and running as efficiently and quickly as possible.","Steve Chercover","Got it. And just my quick follow-up, we know you\u2019re about a third of the overall domestic Containerboard market. If I recall, you\u2019re about 50% of the Amazon\u2019s supply. So can you just give us a little update on just how quickly e-commerce is growing versus traditional box?","Tim Nicholls","Yeah, I don\u2019t want to comment on any specific customer. We service a broad range of online and distribution customers in the space. It\u2019s growing rapidly. I would say fourth quarter I think we\u2019re up over 10% just e-commerce distribution combined and we expect that term to continue.","Steve Chercover","Great, thank you, Tim.","Tim Nicholls","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark Connelly","Thank you. A while back we heard a lot about the changes of postal ridge to take in to account volume. Can you tell us how that\u2019s playing out now that you\u2019ve been through a holiday season and whether you think it\u2019s going to continue to shift a lot? We\u2019re not seeing it in my house as my boxes are all coming in and they\u2019re mostly air.","Mark Sutton","Mark, hi. This is Mark Sutton. We have not seen big impact. I think part of the calculus on that is the total cost of the delivery and the need \u2013 some of the online shippers to value propositions as we\u2019ll get it you quickly and there is always a trade off on labor cost and supply cost versus a little bit of waste in the box and the volume pricing.","So I think markets tend to find an efficient solution and obviously I think in the future, we will have less air in the boxes, but I believe right now its trade off of postage and all the other cost it takes to pick and pack and ship and get it to customers right away. But I think any time we\u2019ve seen inefficiencies over time in a product or supply chain, you tend to sort them out. And we work on that all the time proactively.","Mark Connelly","That\u2019s super helpful. And just one quick question, you mentioned the pick up in volumes in your Brazilian white paper business. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more of a sense of local demand and the supply demand balance down there.","Glenn Landau","Hey, Mark, this is Glenn. Yes, the fourth quarter is seasonally the strongest quarter for Brazilian paper. What happens there is essentially that\u2019s the build for the new school year that starts in the southern hemisphere and essentially in late January after Carnival. So, it\u2019s a build for that demand pull. Net, net though it was just seasonal demand while we saw some signs of growth in the third quarter, this is going to be a slow recovery in Brazil. We\u2019re not seeing or feeling incremental demand associated with recovery at this point and I think that applies as well to packaging. So at this point in time steady, not going backwards, but no real economic driven demand growth.","Mark Connelly","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, on the comment about a line of sight to 10% EBITDA growth, would you say that\u2019s the bottom end of the range of expectations you have for 2017 and if so you know what things could maybe go right that isn\u2019t in that 10% number that could drive it a little bit higher?","Mark Sutton","Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t think about it as the bottom end of the range. I think it is a reasonably good line of sight to what we know now based on what we have in our economic projections what we see coming out of 2017 which has been discussed a little bit, rising Containerboard and box prices still very strong robust demand, catalyst for the Weyerhaeuser acquisition and our own internal target for improvement that aren\u2019t always commercially related.","So, I would say it\u2019s more of a \u2013 as we sit here on February 2nd with a reasonable set of outlook assumption, it seems like something we have line of sight too. So maybe that\u2019s a long-winded way of saying it\u2019s a mid case but I think we feel pretty good about being able to do that, again given some of the specific catalysts we have.","Brian Maguire","Okay, I appreciate the color there. Just as a follow up, just on Slide 16, you talk about some of the pro forma change in the cellulose fibers, EBITDA. We don\u2019t have the walk like we do with some of the other segments on the EBIT there, but \u2013 so I was hoping you could shed some light into what drove the decline there and kind of related to that when you acquired the Waco Weyerhaeuser pulp business.","You mentioned about $350 million of EBITDA, obviously it\u2019s lower at this point, but could you give maybe an updated forecast on where that stands recognizing, of course, you\u2019ll get the $175 million of synergies on top of that, but maybe just kind of an update on where that business is now. Thanks.","Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras","Hi, this is Jean-Michel looking up on the Global Cellulose Fibers. Let me say that 2016 for books legacy and Weyerhaeuser was a year [indiscernible] especially from the end of 2015 that\u2019s starting to impact the contractor on the year. So that had a big impact on the result of 2016 and probably the starting point of 2017. And then we had an $18 million as you know as Riegelwood starter, so that impacted 2016. How do we see 2017? We see a good demand so far. I would say even stronger than we expected. We are seeing a strong ramp-up of the synergies.","So if you take off the 350, which was the target of roughly what we had combined business, we are a little bit above that on a normal cycle I\u2019d say plus synergies. So if we take an outlook of the combined business before synergies and more on what I call a normal price environment, we are in the 350 to 400 to which I will have the synergies. So I know we have the \u2013 but we feel very comfortable we are going to get there.","Brian Maguire","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities.","Chris Manuel","Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations to Carol and welcome Glenn. Just if I could follow up a second on the last question, just to get up \u2013 not trying to pin you to forecast or things of that nature, but if I kind of think of where the run rate should be for the cellulose fluff pulp business, when we think of coming out of 2018 or in to 2019, starting with your 350- ish base and what you had in your existing business and synergies, something with kind of a 600-plus of EBITDA, is that still a reasonable target to think of?","Glenn Landau","Yes, it is. That\u2019s our target actually.","Chris Manuel","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. With regard to Pensacola, I kind of thinking about the mix and what you have down there that was a place where you were making some board and some fluff as it said. Having the incident, does that potentially make you to rethink what the long-term opportunity or right product to make out of that facility is?","Tim Nicholls","No, this is Tim. I think we like what we have especially on the Containerboard side, the fluff pulp operation figure as well.","Chris Manuel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the allotted time for questions. We do have time for one final question. It will come from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon","Great. Thank you and best of luck to you Carol, and good luck Glenn; good to hear your voice again. Question I had was looking at the consumer packaging business, which is I know have been kind of gradually eroding for a number of years and it\u2019s a very competitive business. Away from you, there\u2019s been more and more consolidation. And I didn\u2019t know what you thought about that, especially the last move might actually affect some of your cons given that I don\u2019t think you do much converting. And so could you just talk a little bit about how you see the strategic importance of that business and should there be any change?","Cathy Slater","Chip, hi. This is Cathy. I\u2019d say that yes there is clearly been actions that we\u2019ve taken ourselves looking at what the future would look like with the change at Riegelwood, but not sure how much you\u2019re aware of that. We do actually supply a lot of our own packaging material into foodservice and we see a good customer support for that business with some really major customers.","And with our other product line that leads Texarkana and Augusta facility; those are some areas that we are continuing to work to find good high volume homes for that. But at this point, like I said earlier, our focus with the change in footprint is on making sure that supply chain is healthy and able to meet the customers\u2019 needs in a safe and a way to add value back to IP.","Chip Dillon","I see. I meant not converting cups. And then this last quick follow up, Glenn, do you expect to need to make, if interest rates stay where they are, would you expect to need to make another pension or would it be desirable to make another pension contribution this year or next?","Glenn Landau","Well, Chip, as you know, we\u2019ll keep all our options open, but we do not have any required pension contributions in either one of the years you\u2019ve referenced, but not this year or next.","Chip Dillon","I see. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I will now turn the floor back over to Jay Royalty for any additional or closing remarks.","Jay Royalty","So, thanks, everyone. That wraps up today\u2019s call. I appreciate you joining us this morning. And as always, Michelle and I will be available after the call to answer additional questions. Our phone numbers are on Slide 26.

Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide two including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of our first quarter 2019 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, slide two also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark Sutton","Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning everyone. We will begin our discussion on Slide 3. International Paper delivered solid earnings and strong free cash flow in the first quarter. We performed well against a more challenging demand backdrop especially in our export markets operational performance was strong. We manage costs well and leverage the strength and flexibility of our system in a high downtime quarter.","Overall, input costs were favorable in the quarter with lower recovered fiber cost largely offsetting higher wood costs that were caused by the heavy rainfalls in the southern United States. Taking a look at demand in North America box shipments slowed in the first quarter as customers drew down inventories and we experienced other near-term demand headwinds. However, we continue to see a favorable macro backdrop supportive of continued corrugated box growth.","Inventory destocking among containerboard and absorbent pulp export customers is playing out as we expected and as we discussed last quarter. We anticipate our shipments to recover as the year progresses. In the first quarter, we generated $440 million of free cash flow and we returned nearly $400 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Continuing with our first quarter results on Slide 4, EBITDA was $896 million, that's a 4% improvement year-over-year which reflects solid operational performance across our three businesses. Our equity earnings were $114 million including $101 million from our Ilim joint venture and $13 million from our investment in graphic packaging.","Free cash flow increased by almost $270 million year-over-year driven by higher cash from operations as well as lower planned capital spending in 2019. Although, it's not part of our first quarter free cash flow, I do want to note that in early April we received a $237 million cash dividend from Ilim.","I'll now turn it over to Tim who will cover the performance across our business sectors and our second quarter outlook. Tim?","Tim Nicholls","Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. I'm on Slide 5 which shows or quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share bridge. Price and mix were stable in the first quarter with higher average prices in our North American box business offset by lower export prices and containerboard and cellulose fibers as well as a weaker mix in Latin American papers.","Volume decrease driven primarily by lower seasonal demand and North American packaging and Brazil papers as well as lower export containerboard and pulp shipments as export destocking continued in the first quarter as we've had expected. Operations and costs were impacted by economic downtime in the quarter. No performance, however, was strong. We managed cost well and optimize our system in a heavy downtime quarter.","Planned maintenance outage expense was $143 million in the quarter reflecting an increase of $100 million versus the fourth quarter. Input costs were favorable with lower recovered fiber largely offsetting higher wood. Energy costs were also lower and distribution costs moderated in the first quarter. Lastly, equity earnings were favorable quarter-over-quarter. Ilim equity earnings benefited from stronger operations as well as a $21 million non-cash foreign currency gain in the quarter.","So now let me turn to the segments starting with industrial packaging on Slide 6. The business delivered $421 million in earnings. Price and mix were favorable due primarily to margin and mix in our North American box business which was partly offset by weaker export pricing. With regard to volume the first quarter is our seasonally slowest quarter in the U.S. and Europe.","In addition, in the U.S. we experienced weaker box shipments which we believe is short term in nature. It is mainly driven by customer inventory drawdown and other regional dynamics such as flooding in the Midwest and a late harvest on the West Coast. Some of these issues continued into April. But as Mark said, we continue to see a favorable economic environment that's supportive of box growth as we move into the second half of this year.","Export containerboard shipments remain weak with quarter with customer destocking in the quarter progressing as expected and we see destocking continuing into April although at reduced levels. Against this demand backdrop, we had economic downtime in our North American mill system as we managed our production to meet our customer's needs.","Production in the first quarter was also influenced by a significant reduction of our in-transit inventory between mills and box plants. Essentially as the speed in our supply chain increased from the mills to box plants, we've been able to manage the system with lower inventories. We think that adjustment was completely made in the first quarter.","That said, operational performance was strong as we delivered -- as we leverage the strength and flexibility of our system. We manage direct variable costs well by optimizing fiber and energy costs across the system to mitigate the impact of downtime in the quarter.","Taking a look at input costs, firewood was largely offset by lower recovered fiber while distribution in energy was favorable versus prior quarter. Our softwood inventories recovered as we exited the first quarter and costs are normalizing. Staying with industrial packaging we continue to execute our strategy to integrate the Madrid mill. In the first quarter, we completed a box plant swap to further increase our box system density in Spain. In effect, we exchange the plant located in Northern France one located in Spain.","Earlier this month, we also announced the acquisition of three converting facilities located in Portugal and France. This acquisition comes as an opportunity related to the EU requirements regarding the clearance of DS Smith's acquisition Europac. When completed this acquisition further expands our capabilities and creates additional integration value with the Madrid Mill.","Coming back to containerboard exports on Slide 7, we wanted to give you a sense of what we're seeing from our customers. Demand in Latin America is good as customer inventories have largely normalized during the first quarter. In Europe, we're seeing the effects of the poor fruit and vegetable winter season which resulted in high customer inventory levels as well as weak durable goods production both of which are important uses of Kraftliner. The spring fruit and vegetable season, however, look strong. Our customers are still managing through high inventory levels which we expect to play out during the second quarter.","I want to take a moment to discuss Turkey one of the larger fruit and vegetable exporting countries and an important Kraftliner market for International Paper historically. We're facing structural challenges due to the impact of tariffs and a strong U.S. dollar in addition to weaker demand due to the recession in Turkey. All of which, we expect will negatively impact our Kraftliner exports to Turkey in the foreseeable future.","Within the Middle East and Africa, inventory destocking is progressing as expected customer demand is reasonably strong and we expect shipments to improve in the second quarter.","In Asia, demand in China has seen a modest improvement since Chinese New Year as inventories remain high. In Southeast Asia, high customer inventory levels continue to play out and may limit shipments in the second quarter. Overall, destocking is progressing largely as we anticipated with different demand and inventory dynamics by region.","Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 8. The effective price and mix lowered earnings $11 million in the first quarter. Conditions were largely as expected with a modest improvement in demand for softwood and absorbent pulp following the Chinese New Year. The impact from tariffs and inventory destocking in China evolved as expected.","Economic downtime impacted operations and cost in the quarter. That said, our mills ran well and we have -- and we had strong operational performance. We optimized marginal cost for fiber and chemicals across the system. Looking at the quarter, we had good execution in a challenging environment that is playing out largely as anticipated.","Longer term, we feel good about absorbent pulp demand and more importantly about our unique capabilities to provide value to customers. We shared with you some of these advantages previously. It's our innovation capabilities and unmatched regional service model that allows us to understand and develop fluff fibers or different consumer and cultural preferences. All of that being backed up by a multi mill system that has flexibility.","Turning now to printing papers on Slide 9. The business performed well with strong results in North America and Europe. Price and mix gains in North America and Europe were largely offset by weaker geographic mix in Latin America. Lower first quarter volume was driven by seasonality in Brazil and lower exports to the rest of Latin America.","Operations and costs were higher attributed mostly to expected seasonal cost in North America. And input costs were favorable with cost mitigation across the system offsetting continued hardwood cost pressure in North America due to heavy rainfall across the southern U.S. Overall, a solid first quarter and an $80 million year-over-year improvement in earnings.","Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 10. The J.V. delivered solid commercial and operational performance in the first quarter with operating EBITDA of $254 million. International Paper's equity earnings were $101 million and benefited from a non-cash foreign exchange gain on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt of which IP's after tax portion was $21 million or $0.05 per share in the quarter.","As Mark shared with you earlier, we received a $237 million cash dividend in early April. This brings IP's total cash dividends received from Ilim to about $900 million since the start of the joint venture.","Turning to Slide 11. I'll cover our second quarter outlook. Overall, we expect stronger seasonal demand across our businesses as we execute our highest planned maintenance outage quarter of the year.","So, now let me take you through business by business. Starting with industrial packaging. We expect the effective price and mix the lower earnings $20 million to mostly to export pricing. Volume is expected to improve by $25 million on seasonally stronger volume in North America with one last shipping day.","Operations and costs are expected to improve by $55 million due to an improved fixed costs absorption in North America as well as better ops and cost in North America and Europe. Staying with Industrial Packaging maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $37 million and input costs are expected to improve by $40 million on lower wood and recovered fiber cost as well as improved energy and distribution costs.","In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect the effective price and mix to lower earnings $15 million and volume to improve by $five million in the second quarter. Operations and costs are expected to remain stable with improved fixed cost absorption offset by higher expected manufacturing spending in the quarter. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $32 million and input costs are expected to improve by $5 million on lower wood cost.","In printing papers, we expect to see a $5 five million benefit on the recent price increase in North America. Volume is expected to improve $20 million on stronger seasonal demand in North America and Brazil. Operations and costs are expected to be unfavorable by $five million on several onetime items and maintenance expense is expected to increase by $44 million.","Let me add a comment on our planned maintenance outages for 2019. The second quarter is our highest maintenance outage quarter at $256 million. So across the system we will have completed 75% of planned maintenance outages during the first half of the year.","And lastly, under equity earnings you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture and graphic packaging. I'd note that Ilim's second quarter outlook includes a $15 million increase in maintenance outage expense and repairs versus the first quarter.","Taking a look at our full year outlook on Slide 12. We continue to see a favorable macro environment in packaging for North America and we expect exports to continue recovering. Our Printing Papers business is performing well with realization of price increases in North America.","For the full year, we're projecting EBITDA of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion and free cash flow of $2 billion. We're using free cash flow for debt reduction and cash to share owners. We're committed to strong and sustainable dividend and have just over $two billion of share repurchase authorization remaining after the first quarter.","In the quarter, we repurchased 180 million shares at an average price of $45.66. All in, we return just over 85% of free cash flow to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share repurchases.","So, with that, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, Tim. You know as I sit here and think about the start to our year what really stands out to me is that we delivered another quarter of solid performance and strong free cash flow. Once again International Paper demonstrated the strength of our businesses and our ability to deliver solid financial results under varying market conditions.","Looking ahead, we see a favorable economic backdrop for our products as we navigate through any near-term conditions. We built a resilient company that allows us to succeed and create value for our shareholders by investing in our people our customers and our operations. And we're doing what we said we would do, growing free cash flow maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.","And with that we're ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question will come from the line of Debbie Jones, Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones","Hi. Good morning.","Mark Sutton","Good morning, Debbie.","Debbie Jones","My first question is on a domestic box and you called out weather and customer destocking with that the majority of the shortfall versus your expectations. And then I was hoping you could comment on the confidence you have that you do start seeing the improvements in April whether it's kind of broader macro or some underlying things around certain segments that encourage?","Mark Sutton","It's a great question and probably the $64,000 question. Look on April we saw some things that were sort of one off like the delayed harvest in California we know they're out of drought we know the crops are there the harvest is coming in and it's going to start later. So we feel good about that and in our supply chain visibility to customers we have seen the destocking rate begin to slow down. So we feel pretty confident about that. ","Longer term, when you look out for the rest of the year, Debbie, we look at a number of macroeconomic indicators that we feed into a model that gives us a sense of a range of box demand and those macroeconomic models that we use and those indicators are still by external agencies being forecast to be relatively firm. So we feel good about solid conditions going forward and really a better second half as we look at the general economic indicators that correlate the most with box demand.","Debbie Jones","Okay, thanks. And my follow up question just on the full year guidance. Can you just talk about what drove the reduction? I think some of it must have been the $10 cut and PPW on containerboard. And then Jim comment also if you actually saw that in the market and then how to kind of correlate that with no change to the free cash flow guidance?","Tim Nicholls","Yeah, we have -- Debbie, it's Tim. We thought we had headroom in free cash flow we call that out on last quarter's call. And so we feel really good about the $2 billion being solid at this point. And in terms of the guidance -- you're right it is acknowledging that there was a $10 published down but also just acknowledging that there was some additional weakness in export markets than what we were thinking about 3 months ago.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Gabe Hajde, Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabe Hajde","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first one might start with Ilim. Seems like operations and shipments and everything there seems pretty strong. Can you comment at all about sort of the trajectory or outlook for the full year in that business? And then what you're thinking about or what the organization is thinking about in terms of expanding capacity there's been some reports out there that suggests they're looking to make an investment over the next couple of years.","Mark Sutton","Gabe, I don't think we heard the first part. Where you talking about Ilim?","Gabe Hajde","Yes. Ilim.","Mark Sutton","Yeah. Thanks Gabe. Ilim -- the thing about Ilim is that we've got the best cost and operational position in the world to serve the largest growing market for softwood fibers that are targeted to our tissue towel and packaging. And that coupled with absorbent business we have in the US gives us a really strong position but specifically for Ilim they're continuing to see growth. They see the same thing that everybody sees in the fibers market in China. China's economy has slowed down a little bit. There has been some pricing pressure but Ilim is continuing to grow.","You can see the EBITDA performance and the performance on the IP side of the shareholder arrangement with the dividends and equity earnings. Ilim also has the ability to adjust their cost structure like we do in North America through a sophisticated approach to how to variable as much of what looks like fixed cost is possible and they're continuing to make progress on that. So I think the future is really bright for Ilim.","As far as future development, there are some projects that have been publicly talked about that's normal in that part of the world to start talking about possible investments to get everybody lined up all the constituents, cities, governments, banks all of that type of thing.","But to this point there's nothing formally approved about the next phase of pulp production. We have been doing some things for the packaging business in Russia and in Eastern Europe around containerboard and some box but there is there is a bright future for Ilim as the primary softwood fiber source for the Asian markets.","Gabe Hajde","Okay. Thank you. And then switching gears I guess the cellulose fibers business, there was discussion on the prior quarter call about a commercial decision sounded like maybe some destocking. Also, can you update us on how that's progressing through I guess the first half here. And then visibility into that and getting a little bit better maybe on the volume front and the back half.","Mark Sutton","I think that's exactly our view. We had two main causes for our volume shortfall if you will on the absorbent side and that is the customer decision, we talked about last quarter that you referenced.","And also, if you recall, we were talking about some uncertainty about Chinese demand. It was in the Chinese New Year period whether there was going to be a snap back in demand post Chinese New Year or a gradual return. We see more of the gradual return outside of China we have really good demand in the other regional markets in parts of Europe and Latin America the rest of Asia.","And so we think that when everybody looks at what's happening in China and you see certain things starting to turn some economic stimulus starting to be injected we feel pretty good about the ability to be on the volume recovery plan we had that we described a quarter ago as we go through the year.","I hate to keep saying in second half but in this case China's such an important market as they start to come out of the relative slowdown they had last fourth quarter and the beginning of this year we'll see the benefits of that in our Cellulose Fibers business.","Gabe Hajde","Thank you, Mark. Good luck.","Mark Sutton","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon","Hi. Good morning everyone. Thank you. First question is, you mentioned the -- Tim did the Ilim dividends total $900 million. I seem to recall your investment in Ilim has been all in less than that. I think when he did the investment about 10-12 years ago. Could you just update us on that please?","Tim Nicholls","Yeah, all in roughly $685 million, Chip. So yeah, we've now recovered more than what we have in the investment.","Chip Dillon","Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then a second question. Could you just update us on the timing of the conversion that you planned at the Riverdale mill? I know the last comment was a little bit. There was a bit of a range of dates. I think first half or first quarter or first half I think were the terms where does that stand now. And you know are you because of the -- you know incremental looseness in the market not to mention the strength in white paper. You know considering maybe pushing that to the second half or to some other period.","Mark Sutton","Chip, that's a very good question and you know we did talk about it I think last quarter. Just a quick reminder on the Riverdale conversion it's bleached white top high-performance liner something that we currently don't make that exact product in our current mill portfolio. So that project is about giving IP capability in the box markets for the high print segments.","And so what we talked about was a little bit of a range right now what we're what we're planning on is first quarter of 2020. And it's because of the product that we're going to make at Riverdale. It's not more of the same type of containerboard we're already making.","We don't know. Obviously, no one knows exactly what supply demand and what our order book is going to look like. But we're quite confident that when we bring that product on if we have to adjust our output in other ways in other ways in our system that we've got the capacity to do that based on our order book and if you remember when we brought value on that was also a different product it was lightweight medium that we had sold basically after the Temple acquisition and we were bringing some of it back in house.","We brought that on in a period where we didn't need 100% of our capacity to meet our box demand. And we just adjusted the output of our system. So I'm quite confident that we can slot this capacity in because it's a different product than we're making and it's a product we need.","Chip Dillon","Understood. And last question. I know when we met with Tim when he became CFO last fall. Tim, you mentioned in New York you wanted to make buyback something that's something that has a certain cadence to it and certainly we've seen that in the last several quarters.","And I guess Mark as we look ahead one sort of interesting track record a point that we could see IP achieve is if they raise the dividend again this year whether it's just a half penny a quarter or something. I think that would be the 10th year in a row. I go I've looked back as far as the 1930s I can't quite get back to 1898 but I don't think there were ever more than two years in a row where the company raised the dividend until this streak began nine years ago.","And when I look around the marketplace and see certain stocks that have a track record you see certainly premium valuations. Is that something that you know is important to you as you think about you know capital allocation going forward having an annual increase of some sort.","Mark Sutton","You know you mentioned the string here of annual increases, so that sort of speaks for itself. But what I would say is we recognized the role increasingly we recognize the role we play in different types of investors portfolio.","So as a materials company we have investors that need and want short and medium term returns and you can do that with share buybacks and dividends. We have other investors that are willing to use us as part of their long-term return strategy and obviously in capital intensive industries. That's an element of our business.","So I'm committed to balanced capital allocation and we're trying to show through our actions that we mean it. And so the dividend and the dividend improving overtime governed by Chip our target and guideline of 40% to 50% of free cash flow. So the reason we talk about free cash flow and the reason I'm excited about our ability to continue to generate $2 billion and continue to grow it is it allows us to meet the expectations of the type of investor that puts international paper in their portfolio.","Chip Dillon","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly, Stephens Incorporated.","Mark Connelly","Thank you. Two things, do you think that the white paper market has fully adjusted now to where it's going to be between roll and cut size. I'm trying to think about your own re-optimization given the opportunities that have come up. And with the higher prices that we're seeing, how are you thinking about imports not just in the stop gap period here but sort of over the next couple of years?","Mark Sutton","Mark on the mix between the role various printing grades and cut size. You know we have a strategy and cut size it's a little bit different than some of the market and still believing that there's value in a branded continuum of products and we think that does play into our results so that's obviously an important part of it. It's difficult to predict the role side and the role printing side. Just general offset paper has had fits and starts with its decline rate.","But I think right now we see some stability in the split between the printing paper roll side and the cut size side. Obviously, if you look at our asset base and what we have in North America in particular left focused on that business. They are great mills but there's only a few of them and they lean more toward the cut size sort of branded market. So I think you can see just by basis of what we have and what's happening in the market that's where we lean more.","As far as imports, we obviously look at data around markets and best destinations and we factor all of that into the strategic part of our pricing kind of decisions. And we'll continue to do that.","Mark Connelly","Okay. And just one quick question. You mentioned pulp export destocking. Do you have a view on where we are in that process and has it had a significant impact on your mix near term? That might be changing as we finish it up.","Mark Sutton","So I think we are past the midpoint of destocking. If you look at inventory days on softwood pulp it is still high. They're higher than balance but they're not rising. And so I think the questions are going to be a combination of demand and other fiber choices how fast we can get back to an industry that's more balanced on inventory.","Temporarily, that usually means for us if we took a hit in absorbent as I described because of some of our commercial decisions sometimes we feel that with non-absorbent softwood pulp. But it's not a material change in our mix.","We're still working toward an 80% plus mix of absorbent to non-absorbent softwood fiber and we're still solidly in the mid to high 70s. So it's a few percentage points it's temporary and we'll be back on the track toward getting into the 80s based on some of the comments Tim made about the products we have some of the patents and the customer base is pretty rich as far as diversity of needs and parts of the world.","Mark Connelly","Very helpful, Mark. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Steve Chercover, Davidson.","Steve Chercover","Thanks, and good morning everyone. First one, hopefully it's easy. You used to provide us with your U.S. industrial packaging EBITDA margins. And I'm wondering if you had that handy for old time sake?","Tim Nicholls ","Yes. Something that Guillermo can follow up. I don't have it right in front of me, Steve.","Steve Chercover","Okay. I'll do that. So getting a bit more needy. Obviously, you're running containerboard systems demand. How do you characterize your own inventory situation at present? And how long do you think it would take for the broader industry to get back into balance?","Tim Nicholls","Yes. I think we're kind of where we would like to be in terms of inventory levels as we look at the demand that we had in the first quarter and what happened with the transportation network and we try to reference that in my comments earlier. But a big portion of the downtime that we took, which is just adjusting to the speed of the transportation network and how it's working now versus how it worked over the past few quarters. So I think we ended in the quarter roughly in line with where we think we need to be and probably we manage it week to week and month-to-month.","Steve Chercover","Okay. And similar question on cellulous fibers. You took your first economic downturn in several years. So was that a function of the commercial decision you made or and also was the downtime anticipated in incorporated into your commentary at the end of January?","Mark Sutton","So I think it's the two things that I talked about. The dislocation related to the commercial decision we made and the lack of timely replacement of that volume through the latter part of the fourth quarter into the first quarter, so the commercial decision. Plus we didn't see exactly the slowdown in China coming for these -- some of these types of products and that created a little bit additional to that. So in order to balance our overall profitability, customer service and costs, we decided to adjust the output of our system.","And again, when you think about our system, that's the cellulose fibers comment but some of these mills were in the same fiber basket as our containerboard mills and even our printing paper mill. So we managed the inputs to those facilities enterprise-wide and we managed the output from those facilities, i.e., transportation enterprise-wide and then we look at the customer commitments we have.","And we believe that the results you see the first quarter and the variable cost management is a combination of all of those decisions we made, which, in this case, resulted in some economic downtime in the cellulose fibers business, partly related to the two issues I talked about, partly to optimize our overall cost position in less than full operating environment.","Steve Chercover","Yes, but I mean, I think you actually exceeded our expectations going from the bridge that Tim gives us for each of the segments. I guess you are managing that downtime in a very efficient fashion.","Mark Sutton","Well, we worked very hard at it. It's a very analytical process with some automated tools. I've described it before. It's been a while since I've had to describe it, thankfully. But we've gotten better at it. And the team's really worked well across businesses to really optimize quickly the variabilization of a lot of our cost that sometimes can be sticky when you don't have a robust sales and operation planning process and the ability for your manufacturing and supply chain teams to have faith that they can make this change in an input based on the output of that mill and not get caught without something. And we're just continuing to get better at that and we challenge ourselves to operate like last year when everything was wide open and also operate top-notch when things aren't wide open.","Steve Chercover","Thank you. Congratulations.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Mark Weintraub, Seaport Global Securities.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. I was hoping to get a bit more color to understand the improved fixed cost absorption you're expecting to see in industrial packaging. And I'm sure part of it -- a lot of it relates to likely less economic downtime. And so I wanted to kind of, if we could parse through some of that.","Tim, I think you talked about the transportation network and can you give us a sense as to how much downtime might have been related to that because presumably that is now done and we don't have to worry about it on a go-forward basis, is that fair?","Tim Nicholls","Yes, Mark, it was roughly one-third of the total economic downtime that we took.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Great. And then would it also be fair to assume that a significant portion was also related to destocking in the export market? And if you maybe could give us color on the pulp business, where do you think we are in the destocking with export, and I realize there are moving factors with underlying demand, maybe changing a little bit but maybe more color on how much your exports were down in the first quarter and if it's reasonable, if you can give us a sense is for the full year, how much you would think your exports might be down?","Tim Nicholls","Yes. I won't go into quantifying that since it varies region by region. What we see right now, and I called out some of this, Europe is still in the process and it's a combination of a weaker winter season, but we think a stronger spring season as we go into the new agricultural season in Europe.","Latin America feels better, but there's still some inventory destocking that has to take place in Southeast Asia. So we see it moderating and flattening out in the second quarter and then recovering in the third and the fourth quarter is a general comment across all of our containerboard exports.","Mark Sutton","The only thing I would add, Mark, is that Tim made a comment about Turkey, and that's an issue because some of the retaliatory tariffs. And I don't know -- no one knows if that's how much of a seasonal issue. It will get solid at some point. But we are a major supplier into that market for their kraftliner needs. We have box plants there, and it's a challenge right now. So that demand dislocation or the ability to ship there is looks like it's going to persist for a while until some of these other global trade issues get worked out on steel and aluminum and other things. So we'll just have to factor that into our output plans.","Tim Nicholls","Yes. For sure. I mean, that is one of our largest export markets as a country.","Mark Weintraub","All very helpful. And lastly, announcement by Clebin, I think it's last week. Any thoughts obviously, it would be the first large-scale eucalyptus base containerboard project. You're down in Brazil, you know the containerboard markets better than anybody. Any thoughts you would share with us?","Mark Sutton","You know the Clebin I think information that came out is not new. It's been talked about for a while as part of this large fiber project they have. We don't make containerboard out of that fiber. We make printing papers out of that fiber, so we don't have any real-life information to share about whether how good is going to be or anything like that. But we'll learn what happens as they tried to bring that into the market it's a really short fiber, but boxes are engineered systems and sometimes you can use different products in different places in the box construction.","We do that all the time with fiber makes, our Madrid mill have a laboratory for that different types of fibers and different layers. So we'll see. But to us it was just confirming what was already out there, just the numbers announcement had to be more specific.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Adam Josephson, KeyBanc.","Adam Josephson","Mark and Tim, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Tim, one on the guidance, your second quarter guidance implies I think first half EBITDA will be flattish and then second half will be up about 100 just based on the full year. Can you just -- and I don't think maintenance will be any different year-on-year, 1H versus 2H.","So can you just help me with some of the moving parts there, why you think they are your comparison will be much better in the second half than the first half? Is it better U.S. box volume? Is it something else? I'm just trying to understand that a bit better.","Tim Nicholls","Yes. I think growth -- well, compared to what we think we're going to see in the first half, I think box volume will be better. I think we also are anticipating some of the destocking that we talked about in export containerboard, moderating in the second quarter and then beginning to grow again in the third and fourth quarter.","On the pulp side, again, volume-related, we'll see a pickup in volume and a better mix of as we go through the third and fourth quarter that we've experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year.","So some of the those things are what we're expecting to play out and with pretty good confidence that unless there's a dramatic shift in terms of the economic forecast we see and crop harvest and things like that, we think those are reasonable expectations.","Adam Josephson","Thanks for that. And just on demand for either of you, just a two-part question. Can you give us your April box demand just in the first couple of weeks of the month if I missed that? And somewhat relatedly, just on the e-commerce. In late 2016 and throughout 2017, there was a surge in box demand and there was a great deal of discussion around the e-commerce benefit.","And as demand has slowed in the last year or so, there's been discussion about a potential adverse impact from e-commerce as Amazon and others are looking to reduce their packaging. Can you just share your thoughts as to what you think the e-commerce impact has been in recent months and what you expect in the months to come along those lines?","Tim Nicholls","So on e-commerce, we see it continuing to grow. There's a lot of things that get bigger over time. Growth rates tend to go down but we're still seeing, not only from our largest e-commerce customer, but we have a lot of others that are growing rapidly, too. So we're still very bullish on the e-commerce and where it goes in 2019.","I mentioned without getting into specific numbers, I mentioned demand in April as seeing continuation for March into April, it's moderated a little bit as we've gotten further into the month, but I think we're expecting a similar type of destocking pattern against again, a very tough comp in March and a tough comp in April.","Adam Josephson","And sorry, what was the March number, Tim?","Tim Nicholls","We didn't publish the March number.","Adam Josephson","Okay. Thank you.","Tim Nicholls","Talking about why we're seeing across the industry in terms of box demand and ours was down. I'm not going to characterize what the number was for a specific month, but we did see weakness as we saw the weather-related events and the destocking that we think the plays across our customer base.","Adam Josephson","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde, BMO.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim.","Mark Sutton","Good morning.","Tim Nicholls","Good morning.","Mark Wilde","I wondered, first of all, just in light of the downtime in containerboard in the first quarter, can you give us just a rule of thumb in terms of how you think about the cost of downtime in your containerboard system right now?","Mark Sutton","A rule of thumb for how we think about. Well, the rule of thumb is a percentage, and it's relatively split of our cost is true fixed cost in the short term. So we try to keep that at all times at an optimal level. And the rest of our cost, we view as variable innovative, even if it's not purely variable cost and we have, as I mentioned, on input -- of all inputs, wood, chemicals and everything else and an output of all transportation and supply chain to the customer, we have a supply chain operating model, SAP-based, lots of data visibility and our goal is to minimize all of that variable cost.","And every time we have to go through a period of this type of operation, we've gotten a little bit better at variabilizing more of the cost. And our people and those systems continue to learn how to manage and it's about coordination, it's about not looking at it by containerboard or cellulose fibers or Printing Papers.","It's about looking the fiber converters we have, making all three of those products, taking in wood, pushing out transportation and logistics cost and warehousing costs and using chemicals and other things and optimizing that for International Paper. And that's how we look at it.","So that's our rule of thumb, not a specific number, but getting back to the smallest level it can be so that we have the best possible outcome when we're not running at sort of nameplate capacity. I would add though, Mark, running like we ran in 2018 with virtually maintenance outages and nothing else, it's not actually the optimal way to run our company or to supply our customers as a service platform they need. We'll do it when the market indicates we need to do it.","But something like I talked about before, 3% to 3.5% of our productive time for maintenance, planned maintenance and about the same amount for flexibility in the supply chain marginal cost optimization, the ability not to buy expensive wood when we don't have to, that's where we make the highest level of profitability and have the highest margins. And that's not the first quarter, that's more than we would like to see, but that's why we work on that variabilization of our cost structure constantly. ","Mark Wilde","Okay. That's really helpful, Mark. For my follow up, I wondered if we could just talk briefly about Ilim. I'm mainly focused on this talk about potential containerboard project over there as well as what's your thinking right now in terms of your ownership position at Ilim. We've talked about this over the last few years about whether you want to take that position up and potentially be able to consolidate Ilim.","Mark Sutton","So on the ownership position, it's 50-50 right now. We think that's the right answer for this point in time. We have good partners. It's working well. We have a strong shareholder agreement. We have our senior executives make up half of the board. So it's a very collaborative effort. And we think the 50-50, all in considering what's going on globally and everything is the right model for us right now. So we don't see a change in that in the near term.","As far as the potential on containerboard, there's a market, 170 million people in Russia, the market is a good corrugated market, we participated in it in a small way. There's a little more we could do. And then there's some pockets of kraftliner demand that is theoretically anyway best served with Russian containerboard if you can get the supply chain figured out.","There's part of China's fiber needs for brown virgin fiber that can feed in, that's also the best place to do that from is there. So we look at those unique markets to that cost structure and that asset base and really that fiber source is really what drives any interest in containerboard that goes outside of Russia.","Mark Wilde","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari, Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. Tim, just following up on Turkey. Is it possible to roughly quantify the size of your business there? And from an earnings perspective, is it accurate to say that this will hit both North American industrial packaging on the export side as well as the European industrial business?","Tim Nicholls","Yes. Probably, to a lesser degree in terms of the business on the ground in Turkey and I would expect most of the detrimental impact to be in our export containerboard business. Turkey, in year's past -- it's ranged, but it's been anywhere from 100,000 tons to 200,000 tons. And it depends on the economic ambitions in Turkey and a number of other factors. So it's a big market for us.","And given, as Mark said, the tariff structures that have been put on for one, but then secondly, just the underperformance of the economy there, it'll -- we'll work to overcome it. But it's a challenge in the near term.","Anthony Pettinari","Got it. And then may be more broadly on Europe, you ramped Madrid, you made these recent box plant acquisitions, but obviously the market has had some issues from a demand perfective. How are you currently think about the timeline for achieving profitability in European packaging, understanding it's not the biggest part of your business, but...","Mark Sutton","Well, our expectations on our European packaging business is we had, in the past, a very profitable business, above cost of capital returns. There's a couple of industry changes and a couple of IP changes that led to our profitability deteriorating and we have addressed most of those. So we fully expect that business to be profitable throughout as we exit this year and from then on. And we expect it to be a cost of capital returns.","A big, big strategic gap for us. And it wasn't true 10 years ago, but it's true now, it's had basically zero in region integration on these cycled liners and we have that now and where we have that now you draw a circle around the middle and the Spanish box plant system, it's a very good business today.","There's just other issues that we've got to finish fixing through our capability of the boxes we can make and the full integration of that mill. And I consider us technically integrated on most of our kraftliner from our U.S. mill systems. There's just a supply chain step called a shipping channel between the production and the usage. But to me, it's an integrated output for 30% to 40% of our fiber needs there.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details and congratulations on the operating performance. A couple of questions. First, in terms of pulp markets, its recognizing that your business is obviously, much more oriented to fluff and different than other business that we would see in the fibers market.","There's been this standoff between buyers and sellers, particularly in Asia going back to the fourth quarter that in turn has led to inventories at the producer level rising, and we've talked about this on this call that you're now working those down. And buyers inventories being worked down.","Where would you say your customer's inventories are, both in terms of the consolidated cellulose fibers business and also Ilim as we stand here today? Are customer's inventories relative normal at this juncture, Mark? And relatedly on pulp, you mentioned there were some downtick in demand that caught your operations a little bit by surprise. From my understanding, tissue has remained relatively stable in China from the day that's grown 5%. So what ticked down that led to the downtime? And then I had a follow-up on containerboard.","Mark Sutton","Along the overall inventory question, I wasn't clear to me whether you were talking about hardwood or softwood inventory. I think hardwood inventories are where the standoff is. I think primarily the bleach eucalyptus pulp coming from Latin America is a big input to China. That's what's been publicized that I've seen that there is a \"standoff\" between the producers and the users.","On the softwood, we don't make that. But on the softwood side, again, as we said, 75% to 80% of our mix in the North American business is absorbent pulp. And that has a number of demand drivers. One of them is obviously, the economic health of the population in the GDP per capita and how many people can move into those types of products like disposable baby diapers.","And if that changes because the economy changes that are with you just have a slower adoption rate and that's what we've seen. In other markets, we've seen the ability of a poor economic environment to actually have people stop the frequency at which they use some of those products, which then shows up in a lower growth rate.","The rest of the softwood goes to the number of different users who would see softwood in, some towel and some packaging and we're not a major player for North America in that. That's really the Ilim story. And I don't have a number for Ilim's customer inventories, we just look at what everybody looks at which is the industry inventory numbers and they're north of I think 40 days and that's a high number for that particular product line.","I think the perfect world balance for customers and suppliers is in the 28 to 30-day range. So I mean kind of new assumption on demand and assumption on production and you can figure out how soon it gets back to a more what if it would be historically normal.","George Staphos","Okay. But I mean, Mark I know you don't make hardwood per se, Mark, but using analogy for cellulose. Your fluff business and from what you can see your customers inventories on that side are relatively still high, but working lower, would that be fair? And Ilim, you wouldn't have a view on that. Would that be a fair recognizing it's tough to get at inventory data in China for the other customer side.","Mark Sutton","I didn't understand analogy you\u2019re making so yes, I think the way you stated, high not as high as that analogy, at the high end working off and high basically, because of the dislocations in demand that I described, primarily in China. And a little bit in the Middle East.","But that they thought they were going to sell more finished product then they did, there's more fluff pulp in the system but not at the levels that your analogy on hardwood craft. And on Ilim I think Ilim looks more like the general softwood market, but I don't have on customer inventory levels handy. ","George Staphos","Totally fair. Appreciate the thought. I want to come back to you're saying earlier about maintaining 3% to 3.5% flexibility in the system. The way perhaps you needed to run in prior years because of all of demand for containerboard led to not necessarily how you like to optimize the system on a going-forward basis.","To maintain that flexibility, I could think of a couple of ways that, that might change how you prosecute your commercial strategy over time. Do you think -- what would you be able to relate us in terms of how that changes how you run the business commercial in containerboard differently than maybe years in the past? Thanks, and good luck on the quarter. ","Mark Sutton","Thanks, George. That's a fairly involved question, But I would just say at a high-level overtime, not in the quarter, not even in a particular year, just if you want optimize a business like this, then we believe somewhere in the range of what I talked about is what's necessary to keep your operation safe and reliable and then to keep your supply chain and your customers happy which leads to better value propositions, better margins, just better position for the customers if you have a great product and you have great service. And so that comes out to roughly about 6% I talked about.","For the second 3%, it's about continuing to invest in our system. Some of these boring projects that we talked about something like head boxes and all, what it does it makes three mills able to make the same basis rate range and the same quality, which allows us to optimize the way we run. Everything doesn't have to be running wide open at the same time.","And the other way to do it is challenging our teams through Six Sigma and best-in-class lean manufacturing techniques to improve productivity. And so that we can do more with what we have that then build a cost structure that is not requiring 100% nameplate output to make at least return.","You have it as a reserve capacity like a public utility does and you don't use it and you don't put input cost, you don't put people against it when you don't need it. And I would say there's a human element to this, too.","When you run like we ran last year, you wear everything out. You wear the equipment out and you wear the people out. And that's not a small issue in our company because we want to run a safe company where people are engaged and they're not completely running a sprint all the time.","There's an element of running a nice race over time and so reliability, best practices in manufacturing and doing those kinds of things, building system flexibility and duplicity so we can make some decisions around the 16 containerboard mills we have, all leads to being able to have that flexibility time in terms of machine hours without it being a big cost.","And I believe when we look at periods where we've had, that's where we produced the best margins, the best -- you don't know it but we know it, the best customer satisfaction and allowed us to grow our position because we can meet every need the customer had.","George Staphos","It gives you a more predictable system and probably an ability to have a more predictable customer base with longer-term contracts. But we'll turn that over at this juncture. Thanks again for taking the time.","Mark Sutton","Thank you, George.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Scott Gaffner, Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","Good morning. Tim. Good morning, Mark.","Mark Sutton","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","Tim, I just wanted to go back to the export market for a minute. You said the inventory destocking was as expected but then when you were talking about the guidance you talk about some additional weakness. So 2 things. One, are you seeing a little bit weaker in market demand in the export market in addition to the destocking?","And then two, when you look at the visibility to the export markets, I mean, how do you get comfort around your visibility? Is most of your sales there direct to customers? Or you're going through distribution? Just any color you can give us will be great.","Tim Nicholls","Question. Most of it is direct. So we do talk to our customers and we get their view. I think the part that we didn't fully anticipate in terms of underlying demand with some of the seasonal crop weaknesses that I mentioned earlier. Europe is more of the issue as I laid out in some of the prepared comments. Europe is going to take a little bit longer.","We see recovery starting in other regions of the world, some are better than others, but almost all of them are better than Europe. So there's a little bit more weakness there in the first quarter. But again, talking to customers, we expect that to moderate as we go through the second quarter.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And as far as the full year forecast on export, it sounded like you were mentioning that just you expected recovery in the second half but you don't expect recovery back to 2018 levels, did I hear that, right?","Tim Nicholls","Right. It's going to be down versus last year, but it will start ramping back from the first half numbers as we get in the third and fourth quarter.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And just one last one here, I know we're late in the call. But Mark, when we look at be monthly data for the industry, whether it's box shipments, supply-demand, et cetera, a lot of other industries like retail and auto have really gotten away from this idea of having monthly sales data.","Obviously, IP is the leader in this industry and that itself caused significant volatility in the shares 1Q and has historically. Is there any thoughts to why or why not you or the industry wouldn't go away from providing data on a monthly basis?","Mark Sutton","It's a good question, Scott. Honestly, I haven't talked about it that much. Some of the data comes from aggregation of industry trade associations and it's a question worth considering. I really haven't given it a whole lot of thought. I know that the -- some of the retail industries have gotten away from that, some of them are still in it with same-store sales and those things that tend to cause overreaction. I think it's something we\u2019ll think about.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Fair enough. Looks forward to talking about in the future.","Operator","And our last question for today will come from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Two-parter on M&A. One public company multiple has come down a lot over the last year and obviously, the macro environment and even some of the business-specific outlook has become a little bit more muddled and uncertain. So just thinking how you kind of balance those two?","And how you view M&A today versus how you view it a year ago in terms of your overall capital allocation strategy? And sort of the related question there is obviously, do the DS Smith investment package.","I wonder if you could comment on what that might bring to the table? What that might give you that you didn't already have? And any expected EBITDA from that in 2019 and whether that would be included in the guidance at this point or not?","Mark Sutton","So on general question about M&A. It is true that sometimes valuations come down in periods where companies might not be prepared to do M&A. The way we think about it is it has to be a strategic fit, first and foremost and obviously, timing does matter. But if you're talking about public companies, a temporary valuation change usually doesn't win the day because Boards of Directors look at the value of the company over the past 12 months and all kinds of other valuation formulas.","Right now, we really like the company we have. We have more run rate in the company we have today as we talked about in terms of our strategy is to improve International Paper. It's very possible and has proven to be true in the past that some M&A has helped out and it probably will in the future, but it's not a burning platform for us because we built a really good company, really since the transformation plan coming out of '05 and '06 and we're trying to bring this company to its full potential.","So it's always a potential tool or a tool in a strategic toolbox to improve a company, but value creation, good returns, above our cost of capital and earnings growth leading to free cash flow growth is what we really want to focus on.","And as I mentioned in my comments about our investor base that we have today and the investor base that we recruit, we recognize the balance capital allocation is a role that a company like International Paper needs to play, short, medium and long-term capital returns, and that's going to be remain a focus. ","Brian Maguire","And just on the DS Smith business in particular?","Mark Sutton","Thank you for reminding me of that. DS Smith business. Well, it does two things. It's relatively small in the big scheme of things. But for the European business, it will have a meaningful impact. The Portugal plant is right in the backyard of the Madrid mill and it's so -- it's about capability and integration.","And the other couple of plants that came with that, a little bit of integration, but also some high print capability that we lack in France and in the general Mediterranean regions and so this was a way for us to accomplish something that was already in our strategic list and doing it as an output from a sort of European antitrust type of sale, you're able to be made fair acquisition, addressed two of our strategic needs at a pretty good value. We haven't had time to factor in that into our forecast this year, but I would view that as upside.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Last one for me, Mark, a lot of discussion about demand and the weakness in 1Q and obviously some of that is tied to macro uncertainty. In your view, sitting here today, do you think that if we get trade deal with China, which has been rumored for a long time, that's going to lead to an acceleration in box shipments, both in the U.S. and the export markets? That could be a meaningful catalyst for getting us back on track to closer to 2018 levels? Or do you think looking at the end markets that you got a lot of food and beverage, it really won't show up that much on the numbers?","Mark Sutton","I actually think it's more likely to show up in the numbers than not. The China, I think we're learning every time there's a disruption with China, how much of a role it plays in the global economy. I think the uncertainty around on the margin, a lot of our U.S. customers for packaging, export a portion of their output whether it's food or other materials to China.","It's not a big part of their business, but it's a meaningful part and it's disrupted to some extent due to tariffs and other things. When you add all that up, it's a U.S. box produced for an export product to China. It shows up as softness in U.S. demand but it really has nothing to do with the U.S.","It has everything to do with them or that they can get to their product, marginal amount of their product to a market that's currently slowing down, number one, and number two, in some cases, has some additional tariffs applied to the products. I think it helps take some of the uncertainty in the economy away.","And that typically, when you look at the drivers of box demand, the consumer components of GDP, nondurable production, those things tend to get better. And I think when we had a less uncertain environment with China, go back into early 2018 and 2017, we had better macroeconomic numbers that drive box demand. So I don't have any information to say that, that wouldn't return if we took the uncertainty off the table.","Brian Maguire","Got it. Appreciate the insight. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Guillermo Gutierrez for closing comments.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Thank you, again for joining our first quarter earnings call. As always, Michelle and I will be available for follow up questions.

Welcome to today's International Paper fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, chairman and chief executive officer; and Tim Nicholls, senior vice president and chief financial officer. There is information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers.","For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-US GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to US GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth-quarter 2019 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments on Slide 2, we also provide context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark Sutton","Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. International Paper delivered solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow in 2019.","Our performance demonstrates the strength of our cash generation and the flexibility of the company to navigate well even in challenging environments. While the US economy remains healthy, we managed through significant inventory headwinds and broader trade tensions that impacted our exports. Against this backdrop, we focused on optimizing our full-value chain.","We grew with customers who are market leaders in their respective segments. We ran our manufacturing system well, and we leveraged the flexibility of our mill and converting system, all of which allowed us to continue to grow value for our shareowners with an ROIC of nearly 11%, which is well above our cost of capital. On capital allocation, we're making choices consistent with our framework. In 2019, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","We also increased our dividend for the tenth consecutive year, reinforcing our policy of a strong and sustainable payout of 40% to 50% of free cash flow. And we repaid $1 billion of debt to maintain a strong balance sheet. We continue to invest strategically to strengthen our Industrial Packaging business. In 2019, we made targeted investments in our U.S.","box business to enhance our capabilities and reinforce our strong position in the fastest-growing segments. We also made selective acquisitions in our European packaging business to expand the converting network around our Madrid mill. I also want to share some context around our decision to start monetizing our investment in Graphic Packaging, which we announced earlier this week. The thinking around the original structure was to maximize the value of our North American Consumer Packaging business by combining it with Graphic Packaging.","The investment provided us time to evaluate the role of Consumer Packaging for IP, while participating in the benefits of the combined business in a tax-efficient structure. Ultimately, we determined that a significant addition to our portfolio in the North America Consumer Packaging space is not a strategic priority. So it makes sense to start monetizing our investment and deploy that capital consistent with our capital allocation framework. Turning to Slide 4 and full-year results.","We delivered EBITDA of $3.9 billion and outstanding free cash flow of $2.3 billion. Revenue did decrease about 4% due to lower average pricing and the impact of lower export containerboard and pulp volumes. Our equity earnings were $250 million, including $207 million from our Ilim joint venture, which was also impacted by challenging pulp markets. Despite a less favorable commercial environment in 2019, we delivered healthy margins of about 17% by taking advantage of our manufacturing and supply chain expertise and managing our costs well in our three businesses.","Now let's turn to the next slide and take a closer look at free cash flow. As you can see on Slide 5, International Paper generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow in 2019, which puts our five-year average at $1.9 billion, reflecting our strong and sustainable cash generation. We proactively managed cash levers across the company to mitigate the impact of lower earnings and to exceed our full-year free cash flow commitment. Cash from operations was $3.6 billion compared to $3.2 billion in 2018 and includes a $300 million improvement in working capital.","Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion or about $300 million lower than in 2018. We've often discussed IP's strong and resilient free cash flow. I think 2019, once again demonstrates our ability to deliver outstanding cash generation, even as we manage through more difficult market conditions. So now turning to Slide 6.","We delivered another solid year of return on invested capital with a five-year average return of 11%. Our performance reflects the strength of our portfolio. We are making the right investment choices and delivering on those commitments. I'll now turn it over to Tim, who will cover the performance across our business segments, as well as our outlook.","Tim?","Tim Nicholls","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7, which shows our year-over-year operating earnings bridge. Operating earnings decreased by $0.89 to $4.43 per share in 2019 in what was clearly a challenging environment, especially outside the U.S.","Our results, as Mark said, reflect our ability to optimize our mill and converting systems and manage marginal costs as we matched our production to our customers' needs. Looking at the bridge, price and mix were a headwind, mostly due to significant price pressure in export pulp and containerboard markets, as well as the price impact of index movements in our North American packaging business. Volume was a drag on earnings largely due to challenging export markets. Export containerboard was impacted by unusually high customer inventories as we enter 2019, and it took about three quarters to normalize.","Operations and costs were impacted by significant economic downtime, especially in the first half of the year as export shipments slowed and we reduced inventories across our North American packaging system on improved supply chain velocity and reliability. Input costs were favorable for the full year, driven mostly by lower recovered fiber and energy costs. And even though wood cost moderated in the second half of the year, they were actually a significant drag on earnings in 2019. All in, corporate items were favorable, with lower corporate and interest expense partly offset by higher tax expense in 2019.","Equity earnings decreased due to lower Ilim earnings. Turning to Slide 8 and our fourth quarter results. EBITDA was $1 billion with margins of 18%. The year-over-year revenue decline is mostly driven by lower pricing and packaging in Global Cellulose Fibers, as well as the impact of the India divestment earlier in the fourth quarter.","Free cash flow in the quarter was again strong as we continue to proactively manage capital spending and working capital. During the fourth quarter, we reduced debt by nearly $600 million. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 9. Operating earnings were unchanged at $1.09.","Price or mix was a headwind due to the prior index movements in Global Cellulose Fibers and North American packaging, as well as the lower prices in export containerboard. Volume improved in the quarter due to stronger containerboard exports as expected, as well as higher seasonal demand in Latin American papers and European packaging. Operations and costs were offset in the quarter by favorable maintenance outage costs and input costs improved due to lower wood and chemical costs. Corporate items were also favorable and equity earnings were essentially flat.","So we'll turn to the segments, and I'll start with Industrial Packaging on Slide 10. Our business performed well. The North America business earned $584 million with margins of nearly 25% and a light maintenance outage quarter. Across the segment, price and mix was unfavorable due to the impact of prior index movement in North America, as well as the mix impact of higher containerboard exports in the fourth quarter as we expected.","Staying with containerboard exports, demand is healthy and customer inventory levels have normalized across most regions. It may even be on the low side in select areas as we enter this year. Volume improved sequentially, driven by containerboard exports, as well as stronger seasonal demand in our European packaging business. In North America, we had strong double-digit growth in e-commerce.","And the protein segment continued to perform well in the fourth quarter, while processed foods and durables continue to lag the broader strength of the U.S. economy. Demand in January is off to a pretty good start for us at a plus 1% to 2%. The growth trend we discussed last quarter is coming through as expected as we ramp up our recent business wins.","Operational performance was favorable. Economic downtime decreased significantly in the fourth quarter as we increase production to meet stronger demand. Operations and costs also benefited by about $40 million of onetime items, including a favorable LIFO inventory adjustment. Input costs were also favorable across the segment, driven by lower cost for wood and chemicals.","Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 11. Fourth-quarter results were impacted by lower prices across all regions and a very challenging supply demand condition. The near-term headwinds we have faced in the business have been material due to the severity of the commodity pulp cycle. It has resulted in more supply of fluff pulp and a higher mix of market pulp in our business.","In light of the current performance and our outlook, we have impaired the full amount of the goodwill in the business of $52 million, which is a special item in the quarter. We expect very challenging earnings in the first half of 2020 due to the flow-through of prices from 2019 and the impact of higher maintenance outage expenses. We do see better fundamentals as we enter 2020. Customer fluff inventories have normalized and underlying demand is improving.","Looking beyond the improving supply demand conditions, our strategy is to grow profitably in fluff pulp to reduce our market pulp mix. We continue to feel good about the 2% to 3% structural demand growth with fluff pulp, which is our focus. We had a successful contract season and are on pace to bring fluff and specialty mix to 75% of total volume in 2020. All of this positions us for an improvement in the second half of the year.","Looking to Printing Papers on Slide 12. The business delivered earnings of $109 million in the quarter. Across the segment, price and mix decreased mostly due to lower pricing for exports from our North America and Latin American paper business, as well as the mix impact of higher export volume from North America. Volume improved sequentially across all regions.","Demand in Brazil was seasonally stronger as expected, but was partially offset by weaker demand in Latin American countries due to the geopolitical environment. In our North American business, we had strong performance in cut size with new customer business. However, the roll business was weak due to challenging conditions in commercial printing. Mill performance was solid across the segment.","Operations and cost was impacted by a noncash LIFO inventory charge of about $15 million, mostly related to the hardwood inventory adjustments at Riverdale as we execute the conversion and some other onetime charges. Input costs improved across the sector on lower purchase pulp prices in Brazil and lower hardwood cost in North America. Staying with Printing Papers, uncoated free sheet shipments in North America were volatile in 2019 due to the influence of trade flows through the year. Fundamentally, though, we continue to see long-term secular decline of about 4%, in line going forward with the two-year industry average over the past few years at 3.7%.","Looking at Ilim results on Slide 13. The joint venture delivered $21 million in equity earnings in the fourth quarter. Volume improved as expected, with no planned maintenance outages in the quarter, and was offset by negative price flow-through. Equity earnings include a foreign exchange gain on Ilim's US dollar-denominated net debt of which IP's after-tax portion was $8 million or $0.02 per share. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $706 million, which represents a 32% margin. Full-year equity earnings were $207 million. And although 2019 was a challenging year across global pulp markets, Ilim's strong operational performance and low-cost system make it a powerful cash generator, and we expect to receive about $120 million in dividends from Ilim in 2020.","On Slide 14, I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in 2019 and provide clarity on what you can expect from International Paper in 2020. Starting with the balance sheet. Our commitment is unchanged. We will maintain a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating with a target debt-to-EBITDA of 2.5 to 2.8 times on a Moody's basis.","In 2019, we repaid $1 billion of debt and our pension gap decreased by $200 million. Our pension plan is sufficiently funded, and we feel really good about the actions we've taken to derisk the plan. All in, we closed 2019 at 2.8 times leverage, which was flat with prior year. Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework.","In 2019, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And over the past five years, we've returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders or about 60% of free cash flow. As Mark said earlier, in 2019, we increased our dividend for a tenth consecutive year, reinforcing our commitment to a competitive and sustainable dividend of 40% to 50% of free cash flow. Looking ahead to 2020, free cash flow after dividends will continue to be directed to debt reduction and share repurchases.","Looking at investments, we continue to proactively manage capital spending as we invest to maintain our world-class systems and strengthen our packaging business. The types of M&A we would be interested in are targeted smaller scale opportunities that would round out our capabilities and create value. And with regard to the Graphic Packaging transaction we announced earlier this week, we received $250 million in cash from Graphic Packaging, which is the maximum amount permitted in each period under the agreement. We do not expect to pay taxes on this initial transaction.","Our ownership interest in Graphic Packaging is now approximately 18.3%. This transaction puts us on a monetization path. Moving to our full-year outlook on Slide 15. We're projecting full year EBITDA for the company of $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion.","This is driven by the full-year impact of price carryover from 2019 as well as the January containerboard index movement. We also plan about $70 million of higher maintenance outage expense in 2020, as we execute a high cold outage cycle. To put this in context, we completed two cold outages across our system in 2019 compared to eight cold outages planned for this year. And lastly, we anticipate about $80 million of cost related to the Riverdale conversion in 2020, including the impact of unabsorbed fixed cost.","Free cash flow is expected to be at $1.7 billion, and we will proactively manage capital spending with a cap of $1 billion. Proceeds from the Graphic Packaging monetization, like all of our cash, will be put through our capital allocation framework. Turning to Slide 16 and our first quarter outlook. I'll start with Industrial Packaging.","We expect price and mix to be down $30 million on the flow-through of prior index movements in North America. Volume is expected to be down $20 million on lower seasonal demand in North America. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $85 million, partly due to the nonrepeat of favorable LIFO adjustments in the fourth quarter. Included in this $85 million is $20 million of unabsorbed fixed costs related to the Riverdale mill conversion.","And staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $93 million, and input costs are expected to be seasonally higher by about $15 million. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to be down $15 million on the impact of prior index movement. Volume is expected to improve by $5 million on improved fluff volume. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $15 million.","Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $20 million and inputs are expected to remain stable. Moving to Printing Papers. Price flow-through was offset by improved geographic mix. Volume is expected to be down $50 million, mostly on lower seasonal demand in Brazil.","Operations and costs are expected to improve by $40 million, mostly due to the nonrepeat of LIFO charges in the fourth quarter and improved fixed cost absorption in North America. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $17 million, and input costs are expected to remain stable. As noted in the segment details I just shared, maintenance outages all-in are expected to increase by $130 million in the first quarter. Details by business and quarter are included in the appendix.","And lastly, under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, Tim. I'm on Slide 17. As I reflect on our performance this past year, it reaffirms my confidence in International Paper. I've often commented on these quarterly calls about our ability to succeed and generate strong cash flow through practically any set of conditions.","And I think that's exactly how 2019 played out. As we enter 2020, we are delivering commercial wins and we'll continue to tightly manage our cost, capital spending and working capital to generate strong free cash flow despite earnings headwinds that we look at as cyclical. And most of these earnings headwinds that are price related are due to flow-through from actions that have already occurred in 2019. The fundamentals of our packaging and fluff pulp business are solid.","Our commercial and operational levers position us for positive momentum as we navigate through the year. International Paper has the best customers, the best people, the best system and a strong financial position, and we'll continue to make the choice as consistent with our capital allocation framework in order to drive long-term value creation. With that, I think we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari","Hi. We saw some signs of improvement in China and the pulp market at the end of last year, kind of beginning of this year. The coronavirus has obviously kind of shaken things up. I was wondering if you could talk about what impact you're maybe seeing to your customers, I guess, on the pulp side in China, understanding the situation is unfolding?","Mark Sutton","It's a great question, Anthony. I think the coronavirus, we see what you just mentioned, improving conditions, both on the demand and on the economics. The virus issue is obviously a fluid situation and it's kind of early to tell. There are inventories in the system.","The kind of products that our pulp goes into from GCF, from our cellulose fibers business, is an absorbent pulp. The type of products that tend to be a little less discretionary. On our Ilim joint venture, it's more market pulp for packaging and other softwood market uses. And they have seen some improvements as well.","I think we're all watching very closely and looking at different contingencies based on the virus, which I think they'll get through. But the question is, how long does it take?","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's helpful. And then your 2020 guidance suggests capex could be below $1 billion. And I don't think IP's capex has been below $1 billion for maybe a decade. I'm just wondering what the split there is between maintenance and discretionary? Maybe what kind of investments maybe you're pulling back on? And then just how you would frame that capex level versus a normalized level versus where we might be in the cycle?","Mark Sutton","That's a great question because it is a number you haven't seen. Well, let me just make a high level comment. I'll ask Tim to talk about the categories. Over these periods of time that you mentioned, we're not the same company, obviously, in terms of asset quality, the amount of strategic investment, which we've done a lot organic strategic investment in the last few years.","And as we said earlier, last year on, I think, would be the third quarter call, we don't have those type of large projects every period. So the combination of all that allows us to have periods where we'll have less. Our guidance has always been about $1.4 billion over time. But it wouldn't be that every year.","And Tim, if you want to add a little clarity to the category?","Tim Nicholls","Yes, I think you covered it well in terms of talking about the ramp down and the strategic projects. It's roughly 60% that we have targeted for maintenance and regulatory and then the balance being discretionary. But you're right, $1 billion is on the high side, it could be lower than that. It could be closer to $900 million for the year.","Operator","Next question is from Steve Chercover of D.A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover","First quick question. If I'm not mistaken, your free cash flow was $300 million above your $2 billion guidance. So was that surplus due to mainly the working capital? Or can you elaborate, Tim?","Tim Nicholls","Yes, that was a big piece of it. There are several factors. One, there was some timing on some items. We had lower capital spending than what we had earlier estimated in the year.","And then working capital. We picked up some things. Part of it is timing. We'll keep it.","Part of it is just from one year to the next and so it will probably come back in 2020.","Steve Chercover","And then to quote you on Graphic Packaging, you're on a monetization path. So is it a bold assumption to say that you get another $250,000 that will be put toward the repo and\/or debt reduction?","Tim Nicholls","Yes. I mean, we'll put it through the capital allocation framework. And that's the primary focus that we have right now. So I don't assume any difference.","And just to clarify, a maximum of $250 million every six months that we have, under the contract, the ability to monetize.","Steve Chercover","Can I just ask one other question? You've got some flexibility. Obviously, it should be share price dependent, right? I guess the valuation of GPK will have some influence on your timing.","Tim Nicholls","It will, I would say, modestly, but we're not -- we don't think of ourselves as investors in equity shares. So we're not trying to time the market in an undue way. We're trying to just make sure we're smart about how we think through our right some of the contracts to monetize the stake that we have.","Operator","Our next question is from George Staphos of Bank of America.","George Staphos","Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I wanted to talk about the maintenance spending that you're doing this year.","And you've said that there are eight cold outages this year versus two last year. Away from those numbers, when you're done with the projects this year, Mark, what will be further enabled either within Industrial Packaging or GCF that you don't have already from the maintenance? Or will it be obviously, much of it is going to be related to normal maintenance, but what will be the different capabilities out of the systems on either side when we're done with this?","Mark Sutton","George, I think one key point on maintenance is we talk about the capital, and that's a portion of maintenance, but a much bigger portion is just on the expense side and how we do precision maintenance, how we make repairs, how well-trained our technical staffs are. And they're just getting better every year. So we have less failures. We expect better reliability, which ends up resulting in needing less capital for major replacements.","And that's just been a continuing story for IP. So we spend the money on the expense side in education, training, techniques, and we save the money on the capital side. That's one point. What we've been trying to do is make sure that in containerboard and in the new cellulose fibers business that we combined with the former Weyerhaeuser business that we have flexibility in the system so that we can make multiple products at multiple facilities, that's a strong value proposition for our customers.","It's great in terms of managing marginal cost for wood or transportation. So what you'll see out of this is less variability between the worst facility we have in terms of reliability and capability and the best. So both systems are going to be more flexible and less variation. There's much more work to do, but we have made a lot of progress.","And so it's kind of normal that we would have a period where we can enjoy some of the kind of fruits of the investments we've made. So capability and consistency across those mill systems. In one case, feeding box plants, largely our own box plants. In the other case, going directly to customers who convert into absorbent products.","George Staphos","So tying a bow on that, so part of what you'll get also is an ability to further make your cost variable as opposed to fixed, depending on the system that you're in or the environment that you're in. Would that be fair?","Mark Sutton","That's fair, George. And you saw that. Again, we don't want to get too good at this because it usually only gets to show up when we're taking economic downtime, and markets are slower, but you saw a kind of a sort of a step change in 2019, containerboard LLO experience and our marginal cost management versus prior periods a few years earlier. And we would expect that to continue.","So variabilizing our cost and getting better at marginal cost management is definitely part of it. There are some structural cost issues in some of our mills, especially on the GCF side that are not related to reliability. Just related to configuration and there's things there that we can address and will address in the future as our resources and priorities allow us to.","George Staphos","Okay. Second question, I'll try to make it quick. You mentioned that 60% of your free cash flow over the last five years has been dedicated to value return to the shareholder and your performance on cash flow and your performance returning value back to the shareholders has been impressive. Given the target of 40% to 50% over time, would it suggest that maybe that ratio necessarily has to come down as you delever? Or we shouldn't draw that conclusion? And what kind of circumstances would we need to see where the dividend, which looks to be amply supported now, might be something that is a little bit more at risk? Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter.","Tim Nicholls","Well, the approach we take to the dividend, George, and thanks for the question, is that it's both competitive and sustainable. And so when we make these decisions, when we put forth recommendations to our Board and they decide dividend policy, we are trough testing and providing ample outlook for how we think the business is going to perform. So I don't see a need for the first part of your question and taking the action there, I think we're in a bit of a trough year. We're still on the high end, but within the range.","And I think we have the flexibility to do what we need to do across our capital allocation choices.","Mark Sutton","I think also just an additional point on Tim's comment, is when you think about the combination of near-term capital return via the dividend and the share repurchase, we have reduced our shares outstanding and the actual outlay for the dividend is -- even though we've raised the dividend, as you can figure out for yourself, not growing in terms of pure cash outlay. So we're committed to the dividend. We think 40% to 50% has got the right balance of getting cash to shareholders, but not doing it in a way that's not sustainable. And I mean, that's what we're focused on in the company is generating the cash that's in trough, testing our recommendations to make sure that we are, in any case, talking about the dividend not being sustainable.","Operator","Next question is from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon","Good morning and thanks for all the help. If you could talk a little bit about the South American business, I think, firstly, in corrugated, I know that's something I think you're looking to exit. And I just wanted to know, a, how that's going? And b, you mentioned some targeted M&A possibilities. I don't know if there is a chance that you might actually want to keep a presence in Brazil and if that would be a possibility?","Tim Nicholls","On packaging?","Chip Dillon","Yes.","Tim Nicholls","No, no. We've talked about strategic options. The process has taken a little bit longer than we thought. But we don't want this to go on forever.","But I think it started slower based on just some timing and holidays and gearing up. We have made progress. I think we'll be in a position in the not-too-distant future to talk to you about the outcome. But in terms of an acquisition on packaging in Brazil, as we're still looking at options for how we exit that business, there's nothing that we're looking at.","Mark Sutton","When Tim was talking in his remarks about capital allocation and we made a comment about investments and targeted small acquisitions, if there are any, those are primarily for our North American Industrial Packaging business and for our European packaging business, like we did a few, we bought a few box plants right near the Madrid mill. That's what he was referring to on targeted M&A for packaging, not anything else.","Tim Nicholls","And just to put some brackets around it in terms of size and the targeted nature of it and how it improves the business that we have, like packaging.","Chip Dillon","Okay. That's super helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. When you look at the capex level going down to like $900 million to $1 billion, which certainly makes a lot of sense given the very immediate environment and certainly keeps your flexibility as high as it's been.","Is that sort of a level -- I mean, that should include, I assume some Riverdale expense -- capex. So what should we kind of guess capex will be or would you expect capex to be in the '21, '22, '23 period? Let's say, things get that better, is there a reason that capex would rise up again, given your current footprint?","Tim Nicholls","Should that be situational, I think from a strategic investment type, the bigger capital there, those get identified over time. We don't act on all of them. The cost reduction side of it is where I think you could see an increase over time. But like I said, it depends on the circumstances, the market conditions and how the business is performing.","So we don't forecast publicly that far out in time. But situationally, I think we're in a spot where we can maintain around the level we have. If conditions warrant, we can take advantage of some high return cost reduction type projects to improve the business.","Mark Sutton","Yes. I think, Chip, the way we're thinking about this, if you go back all the way to 2014, where we started investing in our North American containerboard system for lots of reasons to replace the purchase board we were doing post the Temple acquisition to improve all the things I talked about in the prior answer, there's been a steady demand for large projects in our mill system and containerboard. Then we built the Madrid mill, and now we're doing Riverdale. We've got the capacity we need and the capability we need largely for the foreseeable future, not only in that business but also in cellulose fibers.","And so structural cost reduction in our system probably hasn't gotten the same level of attention, and that will be a focus going forward. But it's not as large as individual projects. It's smaller projects across more facilities. So depending on what the environment looks like, how much product we need based on our order book, we can time those structural cost reduction projects a little bit better than the strategic projects where you're trying to bring something on to market.","So that will be the focus going forward. We don't have an exact number past 2020, but it'll be a different mix of projects because we've made the investments we need to make for the foreseeable future.","Chip Dillon","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Good morning Mark, thank you. I think you owe the Industrial Packaging crew lunch today.","Mark Sutton","That happens often.","Mark Wilde","Well, that's a very good performance. Listen, the question I had, the recovery in pulp performance, it sounds like there are a couple of moving pieces we need to be conscious of as we go through '20. One is kind of a lag in kind of pricing and the other is kind of the shift in mix.","So Tim, I wondered if you could just help us with a little more color on that?","Tim Nicholls","Well, I'll help you with as much as I can give. I mean, you see the price follow-on. We do think that markets have begun stabilizing. And so the question will be recovery and how fast it comes on the pricing front.","But inventory levels after some weak market conditions based on individual country economies, region economies, as well as the tariff situation, we think, had a fairly dramatic impact on price as we went through 2019 that we carry into this year. But we think that we are in a place where fundamentals have shifted and look like they're beginning to improve. On the mix side, because of the lower growth for fluff overall, based on those factors, we had a higher percent of commodity market pulp in our mix, for certain types of grades on -- certainly on Southern soft bleach, we have a higher cost structure. We have a very good cost structure in our mill in Canada for Northern bleach.","But for Southern, we have a higher cost structure and prices were impacted more. So that weighed on the business as well. Going forward, it's about intelligently restoring the fluff and absorbent specialty percent of our mix based on the commercial loss that we talked about last year, but doing it in a way that maximizes profit over time. So we're not just simply focused on volume.","We're focused on how do we improve the earnings performance of the business and working through these macro challenges in the moment.","Mark Wilde","And for a follow-on, I just wondered, Mark, can you update us on sort of where the Ilim capital plans are? I know that they've had some big projects talked about over time, but I don't know whether there's been any commitment to those. So if you could update us.","Mark Sutton","Sure. The Ilim Board approved some projects involving some containerboard production, primarily for China. And so that's under way and additional softwood pulp at one of the existing facilities, debottlenecking one of the facilities. So both of those projects are approved and are beginning to get under way and will come online later in next year.","So right now, the focus for Ilim is, as anybody in the softwood pulp business, is looking at getting the inventory stabilized and getting the market pricing, hopefully, back to a more normalized level. As Tim mentioned in the Ilim results, even at these lower cyclical price levels for commodity pulp, the Ilim cost structure is so far out ahead of everything else in the world that it's still a very, very powerful cash generator. And that's really what we want to do in our GCF business, which is really absorbent pulp focused. We are still 10 percentage points away from the mix.","We really target to have 85% of our capacity, which is essentially all of our North American mills, on absorbent pulp, and only the Canadian northern bleached softwood mill on nonabsorbent pulp. And with a demand step back in the China economy, it just takes longer to get that mix up, as Tim said, intelligently, where we're doing it at a profitable level. So it's a setback in terms of the path we were on, but it's still the right path. And the business and the end-use and the customer book is all very solid.","Operator","Your next question is from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc Capital.","Adam Josephson","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Tim, just one on pulp. On Slide 11, you talk about a successful contract season accelerating your recovery this year.","Can you just help me with what your pricing visibility is on contracts that you successfully renewed or secured? I'm just wondering if you know what pricing on that business will be throughout the year? Or it's similar to market pulp in that regard? And then just you mentioned fluff is growing at a lower rate than market. I was just wondering just intuitively, why that would be the case.","Tim Nicholls","Yes. On the growth, I think we've had some unusual challenges. We've had certain countries in the Middle East, which are big fluff pulp consumers, their economies have underperformed, their currencies have underperformed against the dollar. There has been some, for a moment, demand destruction.","There's been the tariff issue in China, which had to be sorted through and caused a lot of uncertainty. And so I think there's been the combination of some demand destruction in the moment. We don't think it's structural. And there's also the fact that we had inflated inventories around the world last year for a big part of the year that had to be rebalanced on fluff pulp.","On the contracts on pricing, you can appreciate why I can't go into a whole lot of detail here, but it's really across the gamut. There's different customer types that we have. And some of those work on annual contracts with price negotiations that happen as you go through the year. Some of them are annual in the nature of the amount of volume they're going to take.","And then there's openers along the way. And then we have parts of the market that it's month to month or quarter to quarter.","Adam Josephson","And then, Mark, just one on U.S. box demand, at least through November, it was about flat last year after having been up quite a bit from '16 to '18. Over the past decade, it's flat or so. So what do you think, just, I guess, forget about longer term, but what are you expecting this year? Do you have any reason to think this year, Mark, will be much different than the flattish we saw last year for any particular reason?","Mark Sutton","Yes. We look at a lot of economic leading indicators that correlate very nicely with box demand. We built our own internal International Paper model and it was reasonably accurate for last year. We see a little bit of growth this year.","But I think when you look at what came out today on the GDP number and you think about box demand occasionally, it'll track GDP, but largely in the way the U.S. economy is configured, it'll always lag that a little bit. So a 2% year, roughly, is what it looks like 2019 was and you'll end up with a box demand that for the inventory issues we talked about that occurred at the end of '18 in our customers' world, you end up with a little bit of a disconnect from GDP. I think without that inventory issue, I think you probably saw 1.3% to 1.5% box demand in '19 against a 2% GDP.","And I think the reason that didn't happen is some of the '18 kind of stronger demand was really '19. We made boxes in '18 for our customers who didn't ship the product to well into '19.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Weintraub of Seaport Global.","Mark Weintraub","First, on the outlook. You noted that it includes the impact of 2019 price carryover in January containerboard index adjustment. Does that mean that it doesn't include any other potential changes, and so pricing is effectively kept flat from where it is? Or is that not necessarily a conclusion to draw?","Tim Nicholls","Well, the challenge is we don't talk about pricing on a go-forward basis. So we have carried in all of the carryover from last year to where we currently are. We have included the $10 published down for a containerboard that just happened. And within that range is our view on how we think about price over the course of 2020.","Mark Weintraub","I understand. Also, the inventory valuation impact in packaging and paper, could you specify those for us?","Tim Nicholls","Yes, both of them are to do with LIFO. And as you know, we go through the year looking at how a number of factors are going to play out over the course of the year, and we're making estimates about what the LIFO charge is. As you get to the end of the year, you're truing up all of those. In the case of papers, we had overestimated our benefit, where we thought we were going to be earlier in the third quarter, and it actually ended up in a worse position.","So we had to make that true-up and just the opposite on the containerboard side. As you go through the year, it's not a precise science, and we're putting our best estimates based on business conditions. And as forecast factors change, then we have to make sure that we've [indiscernible] it up to the appropriate amount at the end of the year.","Mark Weintraub","Understood. And can you share with us what the adjustments in the fourth quarter were in the segments?","Tim Nicholls","Yes, I think we did. It was $15 million in papers, and it was around $40 million in Industrial Packaging.","Mark Weintraub","Great. And then lastly, on the box shipments. So it sounds -- is the win that we should get from not having, hopefully, any inventory destocking this year, in the 0.5% to 1% range, would you say? And also, could you let us know how January had played out?","Tim Nicholls","Yes. I know there's a lot of calls today, Mark. Right now, January looks like it's somewhere between 1% and 2%. We're late in the month and you say, well, shouldn't you know better? But we don't really have a final number until we go through the close process and see how shipments actually came in.","But we're seeing some of the wins that we talked about in the third quarter actually coming through in our North American container business. So we feel good about that. On the export containerboard side, we referenced inventory levels having returned to normalized levels late last year. But in some places, in some markets, our view is that inventory levels are low.","Demand is very good right now. And so in the export markets, we think it's normal to skew on the lower side for inventory levels.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Connelly of Stephens Inc.","Mark Connelly","Thanks. We've obviously seen you take quite a lot of downtime without the sort of cost drags that would have been evident in the past. So clearly, all the work on the supply chain is working. I'm curious if your experience over the past year is leading to more changes? And if, in effect, you're getting more efficient at taking that downtime?","Mark Sutton","Well, it's a great question, Mark. And I would say the short answer is yes. We took a level of downtime in containerboard last year that we haven't taken before. So we were able to do it a little more efficiently, primarily because of some of the investments we made in the '14, '15, '16 time frame.","We also learned a little bit more about how to better manage the transportation component when we know we're going to take downtime and the wood fiber component. So I think we're actively learning how to manage our output to meet our customer demand across multiple facilities a little bit better each year. '18, we ran everything wide open, and there was none of that work being done because we almost couldn't make enough product for all channels that we serve. And we actually added costs in some cases to make that incremental amount.","So I think last year afforded us an opportunity to really try to use the benefits of all the investments we made, both capital and noncapital in systems and so forth in the supply chain. So I would say, yes, we are continuing to learn how to do that better.","Mark Connelly","That's helpful. And one more question on pulp, and I'm sorry to keep bugging on this question, but fluff markets have been tracking commodity markets a lot more closely in the last couple of years, and that's not normal. So what has to happen, say, in the medium term? Sometimes when markets get soft, contract terms get squishy, and you start to increase that volatility. Is it going to take longer to get back to that normal because we've got a cleanup contract messiness?","Mark Sutton","I think, Mark, that's a great question. I think two main things going on with the connection between fluff pulp and the broader commodity markets. One is the shape of the curves on pricing, for example, are similar, but there's still a pretty healthy differential between the two, as there should be. There's a level of capacity in the market because fluff is still a relatively small market in terms of the other markets.","It's about six million tons. There's about 15% capacity that can move in or out of the lower ends of fluff, based on what's happening in commodity pulp. The same producer has a choice. We don't have any of that capacity, but others do.","And so it's a meaningful flex capacity that just needs to be absorbed as the market grows. Over time, I think that will buffet things a little bit better. And then, of course, any time you have these kind of conditions, you end up with contract terms and agreements that's probably not sustainable long term. So there is some of that, that has to be done.","But this flexible capacity that can make softwood market or softwood absorbent is meaningful enough that in soft demand for market pulp or lower, lower price environments for market pulp, it ends up showing up just in enough at the margins to create some issues on the absorbent side.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Just a couple around capital reallocation. Obviously, with the recent cellulose fiber acquisition, they're writing off the goodwill and the challenges in the pulp market. Just wondering, in aggregate, does that make you less likely or a little bit more gun-shy about doing large M&A? I think some of your comments sort of alluded to really just focusing on smaller bolt-on deals. And then just sort of related to that, it seems like the leverage is set to move higher with the lower EBITDA guidance in 2020.","So should we assume that kind of the focus, the priority for the near-term is more on preserving the balance sheet as opposed to share repurchase and things like that?","Mark Sutton","I think on the first part of your question, Brian, the large M&A is not a focus right now because it's not necessary for International Paper. We've got a great company. We've got the ability to improve the businesses we have. We've done a lot of large M&A in the past, and it's now time for us to optimize this and to profitably grow the target businesses, which don't require large M&A.","So the second part of your question, I think we'll see how the year plays out. But the combination, I think we put it on our chart, of debt repayment and share repurchase is a constant discussion in the company about which channel through our capital allocation framework to flow that cash. We have an outlook. We're sitting here in January, but we really don't know how the year is going to turn out.","And it could be better or it could be not as good, and we'll make the decisions. But obviously, maintaining that balance sheet, investment grade, as Tim said, is an absolute priority, and we'll make the cash flow adjustments we need to make sure that happens.","Tim Nicholls","Yes. And the only thing I would add is we have been very clear about our commitment to the balance sheet and how we would manage that. We've been very clear about our approach to returning cash to shareowners. I think Mark's right.","It's dynamic. So we have to see how markets and results play out. We never viewed that we would be within the 2.5 to 2.8 times 100% of the time. We always thought that there could be reasons.","But we don't want to be extremely wide of those, and we don't want to be there for long. And so we have a very strong commitment to support the credit rating that we have. We also are looking at share repurchase and making sure that we are returning value to shareowners. It'll be dynamic.","Brian Maguire","And then my last question is just more of a longer term, a bit of an open-ended question. Obviously, 2020 EBITDA is a bit cyclically depressed. You're cutting back on capex a bit, some of the growth in productivity projects.","I guess the question is, beyond 2020, where should we think about earnings growth coming from beyond price increases. In other words, if we don't get any movement higher in pricing beyond 2020, where would be the drivers of earnings growth from there?","Mark Sutton","I think the earnings growth will come from beyond any market pricing moves is the commercial investments we've made on new products, better mix and growing our business in the segments that are growing the most. And that's a true statement for our box business as well as our cellulose fibers business. And then there's a healthy dose of constantly looking at our cost structure and improving that over time.","Operator","Our final question for today comes from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank.","Debbie Jones","Just two questions. I'm going to ask them together. Are you happy with your current European footprint? I know you aren't targeting any major M&A as you outlined earlier, but I'm just curious of your overall position there and how you feel about it. And then secondly, could you characterize any major differences that you're seeing with the way that your customers in Europe versus the US have needs as they relate to their sustainability efforts?","Mark Sutton","So I think the first answer is, yes, we are happy with our footprint. There are some issues that we're trying to sort out around whether they're structural or cyclical, like the market in Turkey, for example, which has been good and not so good over time. But we do like the business format we have, which is now that we have a large high-performance mill in the mix. And so we're continuing to look to improve that business from its core.","And then on sustainability, I just think Europe tends to be a year or two ahead of this market in sustainability initiatives, and it's largely partly due to regulation and partly due to just the consumer and the mindfulness of the consumer. But I think Europe is a good leading indicator for a lot of things that we learn there, we are able to prepare for here, but it might be a year or two later. But I think that the role fiber packaging is playing in helping customers in various market segments with their sustainability story -- the fact that we've got renewable natural resources, recyclable products and our energy is generated from carbon neutral biomass is playing very, very heavily and well with our customers. So before we sign off, I just want to wrap up a couple of key points that we talked about.","Our focus for this year and beyond is delivering on the commercial wins. We've made a lot of investments in talent, approaches, equipment, innovation, and that's what we're focused on, on the commercial side. We're looking at the levers we discussed today to generate free cash flow. We'll get to a strong free cash flow year by year by year, slightly different ways but what you can count on from IP is to deliver it.","We believe our core businesses have solid long-term fundamentals. There'll always be some cyclicality. We're seeing some of that now. But the fundamentals of what we make in boxes and what we make in our fluff pulp and the role that our paper business plays are solid and we believe in them for the future.","And I think some of the things we talked about today, commercially, operationally, give us momentum as we navigate through the year of 2020. And I feel good about where we are as a company, strong balance sheet, as I said outstanding customers and outstanding people. And the ability for a year like 2019 to still show us that we can generate strong free cash flow, share it with our investors, make smart investments and the company gets stronger every year. So with that Guillermo, I'll turn it back over to you.","Guillermo Gutierrez","Thank you, again, for joining International Paper's fourth-quarter earnings call.

My name is Phillis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Landau, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Glenn Landau","Thanks, Phillis, and good morning. And thank you for joining International Paper's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are John Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President, Printing Papers, the Americas.","During this call, as always, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information, a reconciliation of which will be found on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter 2012 earnings press release and today's presentation slides.","Lastly, given our expanded disclosure around the Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John Faraci.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everybody. As you all know, this morning, we announced our third quarter results. I characterize them as strong results despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. We increased our EBITDA sequentially by $100 million to over $975 million, while continuing to generate excellent cash flow from operations. And I'd note, this is after the divestment of 3 containerboard mills, which took about $45 million of EBITDA out of the quarter.","In line with our commitments around capital allocation, we've reduced our balance sheet debt by $800 million in the quarter, partially funded by the proceeds from the building product from the 3 mills sales, containerboard mills. As well as increased our dividend by 14% to $1.20 a share, reiterating our confidence in our outlook for free cash flow into 2013. And as Tim will speak about after we wrap up earnings, we strengthened our global portfolio by announcing yesterday our strategic entry into the corrugated packaging market in Brazil.","Within our North America Industrial Packaging business, during the quarter, we successfully implemented a $50 a ton containerboard price increase and importantly achieved our original merger benefit target of $300 million, 15 months ahead of schedule. So the headline there is more and faster.","While maintenance outages were lower in the third quarter across, really, all of our businesses, seasonally softer demand in our corrugated box business because of our heavy concentration of ag business in the second quarter, coupled with overall slow growth in North America and in a lot of the markets we compete in around world, our packaging businesses were a little slower and we took a lot more downtime in Industrial Packaging that you'll see during the quarter.","On the strategic front, Franklin continued its successful production ramp-up and qualification of fluff pulp, and the Sun joint venture started up the fourth coated paperboard machine in September.","Let me just move to the next slide, which is the financial snapshot. Revenues were in line with the last quarter and up more than 6% versus the third quarter of last year. That's principally due to the Temple-Inland acquisition.","EBITDA margin compression was primarily due to lower pulp prices. Pulp prices hit their bottom during the third quarter. And lower export price realizations really in all the places where we make paper and export, which is principally North America and Brazil, and they were offset partially by the Temple merger benefits.","As I said earlier, really the story in the quarter is continued strong cash flow from operations, nearly $900 million.","Let me turn it over to Carol now to kind of go through the details.","Carol L. Roberts","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As John mentioned and as you can see on Slide 7, we continue to make significant progress on our balance sheet, reducing our debt of further $800 million in the quarter. And this brings our total debt paydown since the Temple-Inland acquisition to $1.5 billion, and that puts us on track to meet our debt-reduction target by the year end of 2013.","Taking a closer look at the third quarter financial bridge on Page 8. As you see, we earned $0.75 per share from continuing operations and before special items, and that's versus the $0.46 we earned in the second quarter.","The primary headwind we faced this past quarter besides the expected loss of operating profits associated with the divested mills was volume, which was down sequentially by $0.05. And as John noted, this was largely due to seasonally lower box sales noted by our heavy mix of agriculture in the second quarter, and as John said, also impacted by continued overall slow growth across North American packaging businesses.","The operations and cost line, while positive, does include a couple of items worth noting. There's $0.04 of downside exposure due to an unfavorable but noncash LIFO inventory valuation adjustment and a further $0.02 of Temple-Inland purchase accounting true-ups. We were able to more than offset these items with good operations, incremental Temple-Inland synergies of $15 million and the Franklin start-up.","And lastly, as you can see on the bridge, outages were lower in the quarter and our share of the Ilim JV earnings were favorably impacted by currency versus the negative adjustment we saw in the second quarter.","In terms of downtime, we did have fewer scheduled outages, which meant increased market-related downtime to effectively match our supply to our customers' demand in the quarter. Across our packaging businesses, this did result in increased market-related downtime quarter-over-quarter. Conversely, in our papers and pulp business, we continue to run full, leveraging higher export shipments.","Moving to global input costs on Slide 10. Costs were largely balanced quarter-over-quarter. Industrial Packaging did benefit from lower OCC, but the upside was largely offset across the enterprise by higher natural gas costs, as well as wood prices.","Looking at Industrial Packaging, as we have already shared, the business was impacted by seasonally weaker sales volume and associated incremental market-related downtime. The unfavorable inventory valuation adjustments and purchase accounting true-ups in the quarter cost $30 million, and these are reflected in the operations line. We did offset this by fewer outages, lower inputs and continued positive progress on our Temple-Inland synergies.","The net result was an operating profit before special items of $342 million in the third quarter versus $367 million in the second quarter of '12. And I would like to note that the LIFO inventory valuation change is primarily a result of the containerboard price increase as we value our inventory at our box plant at the new price.","With that said and despite the downtime, the impact of the LIFO and purchase accounting charges on Slide 12, it shows that our North American business compares favorably to the best of the competitive set once again this quarter. And I truly believe this really demonstrates our ability to navigate seasonality and run our business both operationally and commercially extremely effectively.","Moving your attention to the synergy run rate ramp chart depicted on Slide 13, on a run-rate basis, we have met our original target of $300 million in synergies within the first 8 months of closing the transaction. An impressive achievement by Mark and his team with more to come as they capture the identified incremental opportunity of $100 million by the end of '13.","Relative to where the synergies are coming from, with more than 75% of the synergies already achieved in overhead, box and sourcing buckets, the runway in '13 is largely about paper machine optimization and efficiency improvements at the mills, and these realizations will be timed with our planned outages that are primarily in the first half of the year.","Moving on to Consumer Packaging. Operating profit before special items were $67 million in the third quarter compared to $63 million in the second quarter of '12. Continued weak demand and pressure on pricing, primarily in Asia, impacted the quarter. But they were more than offset by lower plant maintenance outages expenses.","Earnings in the third quarter for the Foodservice business continued to be strong and were in line with the prior quarter.  Relative to our competition, the North American business continued to outperform the best of the competitive set in the quarter.","Moving to Slide 17, as John mentioned earlier, the new coated paperboard machine at the Sun JV started up ahead of schedule on September 19. While we will begin qualifying the A grade products in the market over the next several months, we do expect that we will have incremental ramp-up costs in the fourth quarter. And as we start up and we line up the machine, we will be making primarily the commodity of grades, and we know that we're bringing those grades and those -- that volume into a softer market.","But we do expect earnings to gradually improve in '13, as the grade A premium product is qualified with our core customers and the markets begin to improve over the course of the year.","Moving on to Slide 18, Printing Papers and Pulp nearly doubled their earnings before special items in the third quarter, delivering $201 million in operating profit, and that compares very favorably to the $106 million in the second quarter of '12.","Volume improved across all geographic segments, including export, and Franklin added $12 million in the quarter as it began to produce and sell primarily commodity softwood pulp to the market.","We did see higher input costs, primarily from energy and wood of $21 million that did offset the significant reduction in expenses associated with the lower plant outages in the quarter.","Looking at the year-to-date volume change on Slide 19 of our Printing Papers and Pulp business around the world, our global demand is up just over 5% across all of our segments compared to the same period of last year. So while uncoated freesheet demand is down in line with expectations in North America, our emerging market businesses are growing at or above market. And we've been able to take advantage of our global market access to increase our exports out of North America as opportunities arise.","And let me give you a great example of that.  When the export volume from Brazil is repatriated back into Latin America to meet our growing local demand, we've been able to use our North American exports to fill the void for some of our core customers. This synergistic opportunity to leverage our global footprint really does differentiate IP from our regional competitors, and we believe that this will continue to afford us some advantages in the medium and the long term.","On the strategic front, we continue to make progress at the Franklin mill, as manufacturing and the sales teams work together to qualify our premium fluff pulp with our core customers. To date, the team is ahead of plan. And as the chart on Slide 20 shows, the current projection of the ramp-up of fluff pulp sales to our core customers will exceed our original expectations.","Now with that said, we expect our customers demand to match our incremental annual capacity for fluff pulp by 2014. So in the meantime, given our swing production capability across the system, we will continue to make and sell softwood commodity pulp until we reach the sense dates and match our supply to our customers' growing demand.","Moving on to xpedx, the company's North American distribution business, reported operating profits of $24 million in the third quarter compared to $17 million in the second quarter of '12. Seasonal quarter-over-quarter volume improvement, we experienced that across all segments, but that was partially offset by lower commercial print margins while packaging and facility solutions margins improved.","Regarding our Ilim joint venture. Operational results were impacted by the continued depressed pulp pricing and lower volume to the Chinese market in the third quarter. IP's equity earnings were further impacted by an after-tax foreign exchange gain of $21 million in the current quarter, resulting in total after-tax equity earnings of $33 million in the third quarter.","So let me summarize on Slide 23 some of the key points from the quarter. We did deliver solid results in the third quarter despite a challenging global environment. And there's a couple of things that I would like to highlight. John said it, we did generate excellent free cash flow from operations. We continue to make great progress with the Temple-Inland integration, achieving our initial 2-year synergy run rate target in month 8.","The building products sales process moves closer to the finish line, and we're very pleased with how that is proceeding so well.","We signed a settlement agreement related to the Guaranty Bank litigation for $80 million that we are confident can be partially covered with some insurance proceeds.","And most importantly, we successfully implemented containerboard price increase, which will provide significant earnings runway for our Industrial Packaging business in '13.","So let me provide a little bit more detail on our outlook for the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect seasonally stronger volume in our EMEA box business and our Brazilian paper business, which will offset some of the normal seasonal demand declines that we'll see in packaging in North America.","Moving to price. Box price realization associated with the North American containerboard increase and mix improvements from higher domestic sales in Brazil were more than offset the negative North American paper mix due to a higher volume of export shipments in the quarter. Operations will be relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, with the exception of the modest benefit Industrial Packaging we'll realize from the non-repeat of a portion of the Temple-Inland purchase accounting true-up.","As input -- and also, there will be an incremental ramp-up in cost that will hit the Sun JV in the fourth quarter.","Regarding inputs, we do expect to see some higher wood costs in OCC and energy costs amounting to an incremental $15 million to $20 million of expense.","And lastly, we are moving from the third quarter, which was our lightest maintenance outage quarter to a more average quarter, so our expenses for outages will increase by $82 million as we move to a more normalized level.","So with that, let me turn it back over to John Faraci.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Carol. So let me just summarize our fourth quarter outlook, precisely is really a more of the same type of demand environment, but it's going to be impacted by the normal expected seasonal slowdown in North America that we see every year after Thanksgiving, and then it's either more of a slowdown if the weather is bad or the usual slowdown if it's not.","So with that, let me talk to sort of high-level about how we're seeing 2013. And at this point in time, we still expect and are going to be planning our next year for a more of the same global economy. I am quite positive and quite confident that our earnings runway will materialize in 2013, is quite positive. It's going to by led by the trajectory of the North American Industrial Packaging business with year-over-year earnings improvement due to pricing increase, Carol talked about, as well as continued synergy realizations.","And we've also got other strategic and cost savings projects and initiatives in Brazil, Russia, China and North America that we've talked to you about. They're all going to turn from cost this year into contribution next year. We do expect higher fiber and energy costs in that new year, probably $100 million to $200 million, as well as a noncash pension expense, which is going to be sizable of $250 million to $300 million as a result of lower discount rates, start of return on assets and amortization of gains and losses.","So net-net, as we look at 2013 and again, I'd say with the continuation of slow growth around the world, we think IP is very well positioned for significant improvement in EBITDA, free cash flow and return on capital as we get into 2013.","Before I turn it over to Tim to talk about the announcement he made yesterday, he got us in the corrugated packaging business in Brazil, let me just take an opportunity to underline our commitment to the balanced use of cash that we think drives our shareowner value creation and talk about what we've done over the last year.","So over the last 9 months, International Paper has used its free cash flow in line with what we shared to investors on Investor Day in May, and we'll continue to do so. We've returned more cash to shareholders in the form of a 14% increase in the dividend, which we plan to review annually. And we'll continue to adjust in line with our principles of sharing 30% to 40% of mid-cycle free cash flow in the form of dividends. We're going to deliver on our dividend growth commitment as free cash flow permits.","We've aggressively reduced our debt on our balance sheet by $1.5 billion, as we've said we would, and we'll continue to do more of that through 2013. Keep in mind, however, though, with Temple, we've got more debt capacity because we've got more EBITDA.","And finally, we've reinvested in our businesses very selectively in domestic and growing regions -- in domestic markets and growing regions in our core businesses, and those will continue to be a significant portion of our earnings profile going forward.","So with that, let me turn it over to Tim to talk briefly about corrugated packaging acquisition that we announced yesterday.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Okay. Thanks, John. I'm excited that I can talk to everyone about the strategic entry into corrugated packaging in Brazil that we announced yesterday. Yesterday, IP and Grupo Orsa formally agreed to form a corrugated packaging business, expanding IP's leading global platform to Brazil. IP will hold a 75% stake in the newly formed company, which will hold Grupo Orsa's current containerboard and box assets, and that share is valued at approximately $470 million.","But before I discuss the Brazilian corrugated market and specifics around the deal in more detail, let me also update everyone on a change to our paper business, which is good news. We have an option, as you know, to build a second uncoated freesheet machine at the Tres Lagoas mill site. And that supply agreement that we have with Fibria and the option to build that second machine was set to expire in January of 2013. We've now agreed with Fibria to extend the timing on that. So the new agreement gives IP the option to start the second machine between 2016 and 2018, which we think better matches the incremental capacity that we're going to need to supply our customers' demand.  And if you remember, to Investor Day, we were talking about meeting that capacity in the '15, '16 time frame. So this enables us to better time capital investment.","Now let me turn to the packaging investment and talk about why we think this makes sense for International Paper. First of all, it's a market that we know well and it allows us to expand a core IP business into a growing market where we already have a meaningful presence with our paper business. It gives us the opportunity to earn good margins and an attractive return with industry margins in the corrugated packaging business between 20% and 30% in Brazil.","So said another way, we can generate greater than cost of capital returns and increase shareowner value in a business and in a region that we know well.","If you move to Slide 29, the case for growth is made easy. Per capita consumption in Brazil in both our core platforms have significant potential for growth, as this emerging margin market continues to expand its middle class. Note that Brazil today is below China on per capita consumption in both businesses or both products.","Consumption in the packaging side will increase as nondurable production increases. And in both businesses, as the middle class continues to expand, which over the next 3 years is expected to grow by 15 million people -- growth should also be enhanced by 2 events, significant events, the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.","If you move to the next line, looking at the growth rates over the medium-term, RISI is currently forecasting approximately 3.5% compounded growth rates for both grades, which will create 1 million tons and 300,000 tons for new containerboard and uncoated freesheet through 2017.","Now let me turn to Grupo Orsa, just talk about the company itself. We look at the company and say that the company has good people, good assets and a good customer base. It's currently earning 20% EBITDA margins and the customer base is made up of a lot of household name consumer products companies. Customers representing roughly 20% of the volume have been served by Orsa for 15-plus years, so really good relationships on the commercial side.","The box plants are located in what is the largest consumer and industrial center in Latin America. So proximity to the market, also good. And the opportunity here is to grow organically, in line with market growth and optimized manufacturing operations, which when we benchmark against our IP facilities around the world, we think there's a significant opportunity. All of that, we believe, will allow us to take a business from 20% margins to a range of between 25% and 30% margins.","If I turn to the deal specifics, purchase price is roughly $470 million at today's exchange rates and it's going to be financed by cash on hand in Brazil and also some financing which may be local financing that we'll be able to repay quickly. That represents an 8x EBITDA multiple and an 18% IRR for the investment, which well exceeds our local risk adjusted cost of capital. And the returns are going to be driven by 3% market box growth and 2% cash cost savings, which is only about half of what we achieved in our Brazilian operations and about 2\/3 of what we're able to achieve across International Paper.","So summing it up, the opportunity is to create shareowner value by earning attractive returns and increasing cash flow. And the real nature of this investment is all about buying a good business and making it better, and we'll do that by growing organically and optimizing manufacturing operations.","So with that, Glenn, I'll turn it back over to you.","Glenn Landau","Thanks, Tim. And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two questions here. One is the margin targets you laid out there, the 25% to 30% EBITDA margins, is there any kind of capital required to get to those margins? And the second question on the transaction is this is obviously still a pretty fragmented industry down in Brazil. So should we be thinking of this as kind of a step one of a multistep process? Or is this -- are you kind of pleased with the transaction as it stands?","Timothy S. Nicholls","On the capital side, Phil, what I really like about this deal is it's really minimal capital. There's a lot of process improvements we think we can make. And there is some capital that will be required, but I'd say it's in line with just running the business day to day. So it will revolve around de-bottlenecking, usage improvements on chemicals and energy and fiber. So in my view, it's minimal capital. In terms of the market itself, it is fragmented, but it's probably, in terms of the operating model, a market that is closest to the U.S. in terms of how it looks. It's integrated producers producing containerboard and corrugated boxes. You really need board supply to be a player in the corrugated box market. And I think the opportunity here is to make this investment and improve what it is. And if there are other opportunities, they'll have to be financially viable and earn the right to be part of the business.","John V. Faraci","So I'd just add, this is not -- I don't think this is a consolidation strategy for the industry in Brazil. Think of it as we bought, the #2 or #3 player depending how you want to measure it. And we think there's good growth opportunities with this business as the Brazilian market grows.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then the second question is just on containerboard in North America. Obviously, some significant market related downtime there. And if we kind of add it up here, year-to-date, you're tracking ahead of last year on the amount of downtime that you've been taking. So is this a cost savings opportunity? Is there an opportunity to take capacity out here? Or are you still kind of holding out hope in the growth of that we might see in the next couple of years and you'd rather wait?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Good morning, Phil. This is Mark. I think what we -- the way we think about the current, let's say, last 2 or 3 quarters in downtime is really trying to optimize the system that we have post-Temple integration. And we're making some choices on channels, segments and customers. And in the process of doing that, we make the board we need for that particular customer demand. But we do have a pretty good system for taking any downtime, whether it's market-related downtime or how we plan our maintenance to really drive to the lowest marginal cost production that we can have in any given period of time. So I think we're managing it very well. It's a big system. Over 13 million tons. And the level of downtime that's market-related plus planned maintenance is still resulting in a pretty decent operating rate. We do believe the market is going to improve beyond what it's doing in 2012. And I think that will, obviously, follow as the U.S. economy hopefully picks up.","John V. Faraci","The volume that we had to purchase from the containerboard mills, it wasn't available for us to ship from our own mills.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Right. So that's the other sort of added dynamic for a period of time as we go forward is as we executed the divestiture of the 3 mills that we were required to sell, we do purchase a good portion of that board back into our system, especially the 2 mills on the West Coast. They're in proximity to our box business there. So that's another added dynamic of 900,000 tons or so that we effectively had in our system in a diminishing rate over time. So really just trying to manage the whole supply chain. And if you look at -- just look at the past few quarters, I think we've got the ability to manage and flex our capacity with all of those variables playing into it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. First off, on Orsa, can you discuss what the age of the mills is right now? My guess it's relatively a young fleet of machines given that you mentioned, I guess, to Phil's question there's not a lot of incremental investment that needed to be done? And can you mention what the level of vertical integration is? Perhaps you said, I had missed it, and I had a follow-on.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes. The vertical integration is around 80% plus or minus. I characterize the machines as being good assets. They run fairly well, but just as, for instance, they have more than 2x the amount of unplanned downtime across their system [ph] we would typically expect. So we see a huge reliability opportunity just in terms of how you run the -- how you maintain the machines, how you run the machines. And then there's also some opportunities around cost improvements from, as I mentioned, energy and chemical usage. So I think we like not only the mill assets but the box plant asset. It's actually a very -- in terms of housekeeping, it would rival what we look like in our Brazilian mills, which is probably company standard. So we think we've got a good fleet to work with.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Tim, to the extent that you will have less unplanned outages, do that suggest that perhaps the level of vertical integration will drop as you'll be producing paper at a greater rate or greater efficiency than it's currently being done? And if so, where do those tons go? Are they being largely sold domestically? Are they being put into the export market?","Timothy S. Nicholls","No, they're primarily sold domestically. And yes, it could drop a little bit, but I don't think it will be something that will be material for a long period of time.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. My last question, I'll turn it over. Can you comment at all on how early trends are in terms of your key businesses, corrugated and printing papers? For what we've been seeing thus far in earnings season, trends seem like they've been perhaps sequentially getting better if you adjust for seasonality, that's across a broad array of packaging and paper markets, but what are you seeing?","Timothy S. Nicholls","[indiscernible] for North America, George?","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's largely North America because basically the companies that we track probably are more North America than international, but yes.","Timothy S. Nicholls","I'll just -- I'll start it on printing papers, and then hand it off to Mark. I mean, October looks pretty good so far in terms of order intake, backlogs and shipments. So if you look across all of the segments that we supply, we feel pretty good about October, and we'll see how the beginning of November shapes up.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Yes. On the corrugated packaging side, I would echo what Tim said. I mean, October is picking up sequentially over September. A couple of spots we see improvement on -- in our online retailing customers or Internet sales look better. We did see some pickup in our durables and building material-related segments, and that seems to have been kept at a sustained higher level. There are some offsets in some of the food segments we're in. Everybody knows what's going on in the meat and poultry industry relative to corn prices and their ability to bring their products to market. But I would say, October this year has got a couple more days than last year's October and I think we like what we see so far as the quarter starts.","John V. Faraci","Tom Kadien, do you want to comment on coated paperboard?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Sure, John. And George, in coated paperboard, the market I would say is still pretty soft. But sequentially, I think for a couple of quarters now we've seen, I think, 2% improvements in volumes quarter-over-quarter. So we're not where we'd like to be. I think we're off about 4% versus prior year. But sequentially, it's getting better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Looking at containerboard, just I guess starting there, a couple of quick questions. Looking at the downtime that you've taken relative to industry inventories, there's a little bit of a disconnect. Can you give some perspective on kind of where you see your inventories relative to the industry? And also, I think you've kind of referenced this, but maybe a little bit more color, as you transitioned in the Temple business, how is that going in terms of kind of retaining customers relative perhaps to the experience with Weyerhaeuser?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Okay, Gail, good questions. On the inventory side, we do our best with our supply-chain systems to predict what we need to make in the quarter or coming months. I would say in the third quarter, we probably got a little tighter than we wanted to from a service platform standpoint, so we'll try to fix some of that as we go forward. But our inventories, we believe, are in good shape at an absolute level. The challenge, of course, is always having the right stuff in the right places. I think we can continue to improve that. But we do like the ability to run the business with a good, tight supply chain. But we need to make sure our service levels are where they need to be. On business retention, we've done a number of things this year. And I'd say largely, we're satisfied. We've been able to earn some business that both companies had before and retained some of that. In some cases, customers have diversified a little bit, but we've been able to replace some of that business. We have been in the process of closing about 9 plants and changing some shift structure with some of the others. And our goal is to retain about 95% of the revenue during those processes, and that's where we're at right now on that. So I'd say, by and large, given we're making some choices about channels and customers, we feel pretty good about it. And our overall objective is to sustain our EBITDA margins, and we've been able to do that given we've got these commercial dynamics while we integrate Temple.","John V. Faraci","Gail, we lost some business. Or Temple was in the process of losing some business in the fourth quarter last year. So as Mark said, we feel pretty good about how we've operated with customers since we closed. But there's -- but by the time we got Temple, they're in process of losing some business in the third and fourth quarters of last year.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Yes, that's a good point, John. Some of that actually materialized there in the summer, but they were notified at the end of last year that some changes will be made. We worked real hard to try to replace as much of that as we can.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And actually just sticking on that, you referenced expecting to be kind of 100% run rate on the price increase exiting the year. Can you give a little bit of color how you see that playing out in the fourth quarter relative to the first quarter next year?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Well, I think it's just a general statement that we're working real hard with our customers and we're making good progress with the box. And each -- every customer is an individual and you work with each customer. And we just -- we're making good progress. So I think in general, we'll be heading into the year, into 2013 in good shape on the pricing across our box business.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one, actually sticking on pricing. TIm, RISI has been reporting price weakness across a couple of uncoated freesheet grades. It seems maybe a bit more severe than what you're seeing, but can you just confirm that?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Well, I'd characterize pricing as stable, Gail. I mean, yes, there's pockets here and there, and everybody knows we're heading to a seasonally slower period of the year. But right now, if I had to characterize the business as a whole, I'd say it's stable.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And actually let me -- sorry, one last one. There was something referenced, I think, in the charges about European packaging restructuring, is that something that's been ongoing? Or is that something new and incremental?","Carol L. Roberts","Gail, this is Carol. That's something that's been ongoing. We've had our Spain. We built our new box plant in Spain. So we've closed a plant, and we're doing some things to realign that business and take cost out. So it's not a long-term project, but it was something that did hit us in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just couple of quick questions, first on Grupo Orsa. I assume that it's going to be fully consolidated on the balance -- or the income statement.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes, it will be fully consolidated in all of our financials.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And do you have the opportunities or any agreement with respect to the remaining 25%?","Timothy S. Nicholls","There's language in the shareholders agreement, but it's really kind of a standstill for the first 3 years. And then there's an opportunity past the third anniversary to either -- to own more either through a put or a call.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And you indicated that the Brazilian corrugated market or I guess the containerboard is structured somewhat like the U.S. How would you characterize the actual box plant? Did they suffer from overcapacity as well?","Timothy S. Nicholls","It's a typical type of converting business. So there's always latent capacity in converting facilities. But I think that if you look at industry margins, when you look at it over a period of time, industry has been between the low-20s and the high-20s in terms of margins. So there's roughly 500,000 tons of containerboard that gets exported out of Brazil to other parts of the world. And there is less than 1% of containerboard that gets imported in. So I think it's a pretty stable market.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Great. And just switching gears, it's encouraging I guess, not surprising that wood products, we've got a nice window of opportunity. Any sense on the timing?","John V. Faraci","Yes, that depends on how -- whether we sell the business in pieces, which is one option or sell it all in one shot, which is another option. We have -- the good news is we have bidders for both. So it could go faster if it's one sale. It could go a little slower if it's 3 sales. Either way, we expect to have it closed in the first quarter. And I think we're looking at the bidding process. We've got a healthy, very healthy process going on, so we like the hand we've got.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Albert Kabili.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, just a question, I guess, on Grupo Orsa. On the -- why structure it as a JV? Why not buy the whole business along those lines? And then secondly, I know capital needs aren't going to be meaningful. But to the degree they are, do you see that as self-funding at this point?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Yes, I do see it as self-funding, more than self-funding. And why 75-25? Well, you got a person who started the business and he doesn't want to leave it entirely. So we'll be -- we'll have a management team in place that runs the business on a day-to-day basis, but he's a local business man. He's built the business up from the ground and wants to continue to be a part of the business.","John V. Faraci","And I think in our discussions with -- he was a major shareowner, and this discussions have been going on for quite some time. We come to believe that we can be -- he'd make a good partner. So we're not -- his preference was to keep the stake, and we were okay with that.","Timothy S. Nicholls","I mean, he really -- he knows the local market. He knows the customers. They have a very good commercial organization. I think he'd take the power of their commercial organization and our manufacturing and process know-how, and it will be a pretty powerful combination.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. That's helpful. And just along M&A and capital allocation. At this point, with this acquisition, with still integrating Temple-Inland, how do you see future M&A playing out versus the capital allocation priorities that you've laid out?","John V. Faraci","Yes, this is not an M&A agenda. This Orsa has been on the radar screen for quite some time in terms of discussions. So we like the hand we have. We've got a lot going on, as you said, around the world. And as I said, we're poised to deliver significant improvement in EBITDA, free cash flow and ROI next year with everything we've got. So the balance allocation of cash is going to continue, and I don't think there's a big M&A pipeline ahead.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Okay, got it. And then final question for Caroline. I may have missed it, but on the initial read on pension expense next year, is that -- did you indicate that was $200 million higher? Or $200 million to $250 million is going to be the total expense for pension next year?","Carol L. Roberts","Al, you've heard it correctly that it's $250 million incremental pension expense, and you know where that's coming from. That is really just really driven by the discount rate. When you look at the interest cost calculation and then you look at the amortization of gains and losses, it's impacted by the discount rate. So unfortunately, it's an expense but fortunately, it's not cash. And if you go back and you look at the cash requirements, we -- looks like for '13, we've got a very small $40 million required cash contribution to the pension.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. And that's with the help of the highway bill as well, I take it?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","With just a couple of uncoated freesheet producers, it's striking how different people's view of the market is. I wonder if you could give us your perspective on some of the submarkets and how IP is performing relative to your view of the overall market? And also, if you could tell us how you're thinking about the substitution risk from some of the new stuff that we're seeing out there, whether that's going to affect you in specific places or whether it's just going to affect the fringe players?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Mark, it's Tim. A couple of things. One, it's not uniform across all uncoated freesheet segments of the market. You're absolutely right. Printing Papers is and has been a little bit weaker than some of the other segments. But we look at our footprint here in North America and the customers that we're supplying. And then the second major point is we're able, given our footprint globally, to look out to other regions and take advantage of our presence in Latin America, our presence in Europe. And so where there has been soft places in the U.S. market, we've been -- we've had an export opportunity, not at the same margin structure but on export opportunity to either backfill Brazil and Europe or supplement Brazil's capabilities in Latin America.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Can you give us a sense of whether the roll market looks very different from you versus cut size at this point? Again, I'm just trying to get a sense because it seems like every producer we talk to has got a different view, and that seems awfully strange in this market.","Timothy S. Nicholls","Maybe strange a little bit, but I don't think so. You got to look at weighting of position in terms of where people are -- what part of the market different companies are supplying. I can only speak to ours. We don't have a huge roll offset exposure to the market. So we're big on cut size and we're big on converting papers. And then we have a big specialty business that's embedded within printing and communications papers. So I think it depends on business mix across companies.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Is it fair to say that you're probably not very concerned about the substitution risk from some of these lower-end grades?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Well I think you're always -- you look at the market, you want to make sure you're competitive. But we look at the fact that we consider ourselves a long-term strategic supplier with good quality and a great service platform, and that's how we're going to compete. We're not going to look at every competitor as an equal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The first question is really just around capital allocation and more specifically, around the debt reduction. You have that Slide 7 where you show currently at 3.5x net debt to EBITDA on an adjusted basis for the Moody's target. And John, I think you might have even alluded to this a little bit on the call, it's just the growth in EBITDA as we move into 2013 should -- as you have Temple-Inland for the full year, should move that number down slightly? How are you thinking about debt paydown versus actual just reduction in the leverage ratios going forward and maybe more cash for other capital allocation priorities?","John V. Faraci","Carol, why don't you talk about how we financed Temple, and then I'll come back and kind of share some thoughts on capital allocation going forward.","Carol L. Roberts","Sure. When we financed Temple, we did a bond offering in the fourth quarter of '11 and we did short-term debt this year, which we are paying back pretty aggressively. Our plan for next year is to continue to actually pay down debt. We've got targeted another $1 billion of debt repayment in '13, and we'll take the opportunity to pay down what debt is the most effective for us because we don't have a lot of maturities coming right at us. And with the cash flow generation that we have for next year, which will be strong, that will be a good plan, and we'll have opportunities to look at other options for cash.","John V. Faraci","We will pay down most of the bank debt by the end of next year.","Carol L. Roberts","Well, we'll actually pay down most of the bank debt by, yes, by the beginning of next year. And we also have the proceeds then of the building products coming in, along with strong cash flow from the business. So we should be in good shape.","John V. Faraci","So we remain committed to an EBITDA-to-debt target of 3 or less and we're making progress moving in that direction. We're going to be able to carry more balance sheet debt because of the increase EBITDA. And if you think about -- go back to Investor Day, we think our mid-cycle EBITDA target is just north of $5 billion. The -- we're not there yet, but we're moving in that direction. So I think we've -- it's playing out the way we financed it, and we like where we're at.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on that, the pension gap you have listed here, $2.7 billion. You did note that the pension expense goes higher, $250 million to $300 million. How does that pension gap change as we move into 2013, if you're current assumptions around pension expense hold?","Carol L. Roberts","Well, of course, what we'll do at the end of the year, we will calculate the pension gap based upon asset returns through the end of the year and whatever the discount rate is at the end. So I wouldn't speculate on what that will be, but will do that calculation and we'll do that at year end.","John V. Faraci","At some point in our lifetime, interest rates will turn up. That 200 basis point increase in interest rates wipes out that pension gap. So we've been incorrectly thinking that interest rate at some point will move up. Last year, this year, next year, the answer is probably they're not going to, but we don't want an overfunded plan. So we'll put cash when it's needed. That's all part of our cash allocation plan. And our free cash flow is strong enough that we can be increasing the dividend while we're paying down debt, funding the pension plan while we're paying down debt and spending the appropriate amount of CapEx to keep the business competitive.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. Hopefully, the highway bill allows you to not overfund the pension a little bit and maybe have those interest rates come back in the next year, give you some time for that to correct itself. Just lastly, on the Temple-Inland synergies, you noted $15 million of Temple-Inland synergies in Industrial Packaging in the quarter. You noted that you're at a $300 million run rate. Are there synergies outside of the actual Industrial Packaging segment? I just would have thought you would have been higher than $15 million in the quarter based off of attaining the $300 million run rate at the end of -- end of 3Q?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Scott, this is Mark. I think there are synergies and obviously accrue, some of it is in the sourcing areas. And I don't have that number for the third quarter handy. But there are some synergies relative to the Temple acquisition that's not captured just in Industrial Packaging business, but it's -- the lion's share is in the packaging.","John V. Faraci","But think of it this way, the second quarter run rate was about $240 million, another $15 million in the quarter means -- at the third quarter run rate is about $300 million. So that the kind of annualized impact of what happened in the quarter is $60 million. We're not done.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just one, just following up on the Temple's building materials business and for sale. And lots of earnings reports this morning, so I may have missed it in your stuff. But if you could tell us the contribution from this business in Q3 and year-to-date?","John V. Faraci","Well, it's not reported as part of our business because it's a business held for sale. And its EBITDA numbers are quite -- are pretty good, and their quarter-over-quarter, they keep on improving.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","You had kind of alluded to increasing the dividend. Obviously, you just did that. But is it fair for us to think if you can deliver on the ramp in earnings you're expecting that what we saw is going to be the first -- hopefully is going to be a series of significant dividend increases?","John V. Faraci","As I said, Mark, earlier, we're -- we told investors that we think 30% to 40% of free cash flow with the cycle is the appropriate dividend. We're going to be reviewing the dividend with the board on an annual basis. And absolutely, I think as we make progress and I think I've said it, we're quite confident in the earnings runway for next year, even in a kind of a confusing and sideways global environment that we can improve our EBITDA, our free cash flow and our return on capital. As that happens, we'll be looking to dividend in due course next year.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And obviously, getting the box price increases is an important part of that ramp in 2013 earnings-wise. If you look back historically, have there been times when you've been able to get better than full pass-through of a containerboard price increase? And I realize you're still in process, so I'm sure you can't answer this question yet. But what tend to be the characteristics in place that have enabled that to happen? And what -- how would that compare to the types of situation we see today?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Well, I think I don't have every past price increase on the top of my mind, but they probably have been some examples where the box price increase, depending on the segment it goes into and how the value chain is constructed, box versus sheets, that there have been higher pass-throughs. But I would say, if you think about this particular price environment as a normal price environment from a board through box standpoint, not anything out of the ordinary.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, great. And then real quick, Carol, you had mentioned that true-up is going away. Did that also -- did that include the LIFO inventory adjustments going away in the fourth quarter?","Carol L. Roberts","No, Mark. The LIFO will be into the fourth quarter. What we had is we did have a catch-up of some purchase accounting, and I think that was around a couple of cents, so about $10 million that was catch-up for previous quarters. That does go away. But the LIFO will be -- we split that over the 2 remaining quarters of the year. So we'll see that again in the fourth quarter.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, so I don't want to get too much in the weeds, but so in the first quarter, it goes away?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, will just start over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Forgive me if someone's asked this. But Pulp and Paper Week, as you know, is changing the way that they're going to report the board prices with their acquisition of Official Board Markets. And I just wanted to just check and see how that might affect your contracts given -- at least the ones that are indexed, given that they might go to a different way of looking at where prices are, and if your contracts anticipate something like this.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Chip, RISI did -- has been working on this for a while. I guess, since they've bought OBM and they're doing a process to get input from all the stakeholders. And we all participate and listen to that process. But we've done some changes over time or have been involved in changes with indexes. And I'm sure we'll figure something out that works for our customers and for us. It's hard to speculate on exactly what they're going to do because they haven't done it yet. But I think we believe we'll be fine with whatever we do to merge those, and it'll work for us and it'll work for our customers.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And then I guess as -- maybe as a related question, do you all have a thought about, just a high-level thought, obviously, about how closely you believe your prices should be tied to what RISI says or puts out there? Or do you -- And I guess that would take time to even implement if you even felt that was something you wanted to move away from?","Mark Stephan Sutton","We're comfortable with the structure that we have right now. A lot of our customers like to have index, and it's more for change than -- indexes at an absolute level in almost any industry are hard to tie down. But adding something that starts a discussion around change, I think works for a lot of our customers. And so we have a lot of contracts that have that. We have a lot of business that doesn't have it, and we are able to do fine with either kind of structure.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mark, just a couple of clean-up things in the Containerboard business. One, if you look at the industry numbers for the third quarter in terms of operating rates and production, it looks like there was about 335,000 tons of total industry downtime in the third quarter. Again, just working off of the AF&PA data, and you guys you've taken out 319,000. So it would look like you've taken 95% of all the downtime in the industry in the third quarter, which seems kind of surprising to me. Am I missing something?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Well we took 319,000 tons of downtime, that part you got right. And we have a production plan that made what we needed to make to fill our orders. We do have a segment mix that's not the same as every other company, obviously. And seasonally, since our ag business is so big in the second quarter, we were down probably more than the industry itself in the third quarter, and we're just kind of learning the new seasonality and optimizing the segments we have. But as I said earlier, the plan that we operated under in the third quarter, when you look at the total mix of market and maintenance was, I think, incrementally 70,000 tons or so or 75,000 more than what we've been tracking the last few quarters in basically kind of flat market.","John V. Faraci","And Mark, I'd also suggest to take up 2 things. First of all, it's now a 13 million ton system, so what's a big downtime number is a smaller piece of the total capacity. And we've also got 900,000 tons that we're contractually obligated to buy back. Actually that ramps down over time.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. And just -- I guess, John, what I'm trying to figure out is it would only mean like 15,000 tons of total downtime in the third quarter for the rest of the industry, which is about 65% or 70% of capacity. I know at least one of your competitors has kind of an ongoing issue in the middle town in Louisiana. I don't know what everybody else is doing. So it's just I'm trying to figure out if there's something that's not right in the industry data because it just seems so unlikely to me that you would be 95% of the industry downtime in the quarter?","John V. Faraci","All we can tell you is what we did. But I think -- importantly, look at our margins. Despite that downtime, our margins were better or slightly better than the competition.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I know. Listen, I got no problem with margin. I mean, I'm just trying to understand what you're telling us and then what the industry data is reporting. I'm trying to figure out if there's something screwy in the industry data? Do you have more -- is there more capacity out there than the industry is showing right now?","John V. Faraci","When you get the answer, let us know.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Well another question from Mark. And I just -- on that -- on this box price increase, just so we're all clear, you said you'd have it substantially in place at the end of the fourth quarter. We know that there's a number of customers out there that kind of reprice on the start of the quarter, start of the year. Is that a significant portion of your mix so that we would kind of think about your prices moving up through the fourth quarter and then at end of the meaningful stair step, does this repricing occurs for Jan 1?","Mark Stephan Sutton","We've got a number of different realization schedules as you can imagine. And I think as you just mentioned, depending on the segment, the customer, the individual agreement, I would say, based on normal realization schedule, we're working through and very satisfied with what we're -- the progress we're making with our customers. And we should be at a run rate as we leave the year with announced price increase largely in place. That's about all I can say in terms of detail.","John V. Faraci","Yes. Looking at our business, Mark, we see the full impact of -- for International Paper in 2013.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, okay. I'm just making -- I'm just trying to think about sort of how much we might be pricing in for the fourth quarter as we kind of think about the trajectory through the quarter and try to figure out if there's this stair-step at the end. The one other question I have is just on Orsa, is there an opportunity, Tim, to perhaps move some equipment from other IP locations around the world down to Brazil to put into the JV?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Mark, it's Tim. There might be, but that's not the primary focus. I mean, we've got good assets in this business and it's just a matter of optimizing what we have at the moment.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And could you just -- I think both Klabin and Rogesa -- Rogesa just added capacity. Klabin is, I think, actually talking about a new mill down there. Can you just talk about a little bit about what you see on the supply side down in Brazil over the next few years?","Timothy S. Nicholls","I don't know anymore than what's been publicly stated by the other players down there. So it's -- what I read is that people are bringing on new capacity and shutting down old capacity.","Operator","This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Glenn Landau.","Glenn Landau","Thanks, Phillis. And thanks to everybody for joining our third quarter conference call. As always, we will be available post the call at the numbers listed on the first page of the Appendix. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

My name is Rachel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Third Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. Mr. Jay Royalty, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Jay Royalty","Thanks, Rachel. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning will be Mark Sutton, Chief Executive Officer; along with Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide two of our presentation.","We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter press release and today's presentation slides.","Lastly, slide four provides context around the Ilim joint ventures, financial information and statistical measures.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.","Mark Sutton","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining our call today. Regarding the format for today\u2019s call, it will be similar to what we've done recently. Carol and I will review our third quarter 2014 results and the performances of our individual businesses. We will then take a look at the fourth quarter outlook and open it up for your questions.","I am on slide five now, International Paper delivered a record quarter both EBITDA and free cash flow in the third quarter. We had strong performance from many of our businesses, as our team continues to execute very well. We announced the dividend increase of 14% from a $1.40 to $1.60 per share, which is our third consecutive fourth quarter double-digit increase.","We continue to opportunistically buyback shares and have purchased more than 1.4 billion worth of shares since last September and through yesterday as of this call. Additionally, we received the dividend of $56 million from Ilim during the quarter and the JV continues to ramp up post the major capital projects and had another good quarter of solid performance. Due to the devaluation of the Russian ruble, the JV took large non-cash charge against its U.S. denominated debt.","Moving to the financials on slide six, I\u2019d note that beginning this quarter, xpedx is reflected as a discontinued operation in all periods presented. And as you can see, International Paper delivered strong financial results across the Board. As mentioned earlier, both EBITDA and free cash flow are at record levels as was EBIT. Our EBITDA margins approached 20% for the entire company for the quarter.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Carol Roberts and ask her to discuss the details on the quarter, as well as results of respected businesses. Carol?","Carol Roberts","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide seven, the sequential EPS bridge, IP earned $0.95 per share in the third quarter versus $0.93 per share in the second quarter. This was a strong performance for the company, particularly given the significant EPS impact of $0.25 per share sequentially from the FX on the Ilim debt that you see on the right hand side of the slide.","So talking about the business fundamentals, pricing was relatively stable across the businesses, as was volume. Operational performance remained strong and contributed favorably to the results. Maintenance outages were substantially lower as we expected. Input costs moderated very slightly, but in our view remained at relatively high levels and if you\u2019ll take a look at slide 42 in the appendix, you will see that input costs are actually $26 million higher than the same period last year and this is mostly driven by wood costs.","Tax and interest expenses came in slightly lower than the second quarter, so a sequential pickup. And as Mark mentioned earlier, all results have been revised to account for xpedx moving to discontinued operations.","Now turning to the individual businesses, Industrial Packaging delivered a really outstanding quarter, record earnings driven by stable prices, solid operations and lower outage expenses. The modest softness we experienced in pricing was attributable to lower export pricing, contributed also due to the strengthening U.S. dollar.","Our lower volume quarter-over-quarter was driven by reduced U.S. exports. They were down 44,000 ton and lower shipments in our European Packaging business, which is really due to seasonal factors.","Operations were strong as our teams continued to run well and as expected we had fewer outages. Relative input costs the benefit of lower OCC was offset by higher wood costs in the quarter.","Turning to the North American Industrial Packaging margin comparison, we turned in another really strong quarter and continued to outperform our primary competitors both for the quarter and the trailing 12-month period.","Slide 10 is a slide that we used on last quarter that we introduced to take a deeper dive relative to demand and volume for the U.S. Corrugated business. And if I draw your attention to the map, you can see that for about 80% of our business, which is east of the Rockies, we actually outperformed the industry with a little over 2% year-over-year growth. This performance relates to the strong positions and superior value propositions we have with customers who are winning in their respective segments.","West of the Rockies, which represents about 19% of our business we trail industry for the quarter and this is primarily due to weakness associated with the agricultural business affected by drought and other weather-related circumstances and for International Paper this is a segment where we have a significant position.","Turning now to Consumer Packaging, we talked about a strong second half story and I would say that we clearly executed in that regard in the third quarter. On pricing we saw an increase in North America that was more than offset by what's going on in Asia and Europe, and let me speak to both of those for a moment.","In Europe due to weaker demand in our home markets, we are exporting more and this business comes at more competitive prices and margins, which negatively impacts our mix. In Asia, due to the excess capacity of the industry, our margins have also declined. So that\u2019s the pricing and mix story.","On the volume side, we saw a nice increase in volume in North America coming out of the heavy outage quarter and our Foodservice business had another record quarter with revenue up 15% year-over-year.","Europe also saw improvement as we had a full production quarter at our Kwidzyn, Poland mill following the extended outage we took to do some very nice work on our paperboard machine there. And finally, as you can operations were much stronger throughout a steady third quarter and also in the absence of the heavy outages.","So turning to slide 12, looking at our relative EBITDA margins in North America. You can see the significant improvement coming out of the second quarter and the first half of the year, and we do expect to carry this momentum through the fourth quarter and as we exit 2014.","Slide 13, turning to our Global Printing Papers business, we experienced solid improvement in earning this business as well. Prices were stable in North America and up in pulp, particularly fluff. In Europe we did experience some declines in our paper pricing.","Volume was stronger particularly in North America, as we took advantage of all our channels to market, including export. And in Brazil we saw some improvement in volume. Although, we would say, that the fundamentals in Brazil do remain challenging.","On the operational front, overall performance was solid. The Courtland closure and transition is complete. Although, there will be some minimal costs that will continue for facility maintenance and security. And we also saw an FX benefit due to our export positions in Brazil and Europe.","Looking at the North American margin comparison for the Papers business, the Portland shutdown has been concluded and we had a solid quarter. And if you consider the impact of the shutdown and transition costs, this negatively impacted on margins over the last 12 months by roughly 200 basis points.","Slide 15, I think this is a great slide that tell us a really good story relative to the state of the global paper business. This chart reflects the year-over-year earnings change by region for the third quarter and in North America, you can see even with Courtland out this year versus last year, earnings actually increased by $13 million.","In our pulp business, due to the continued performance in ramp-up of the Franklin operation along with improved pricing, earnings increased by $17 million. And in Brazil, despite weakening -- weakened economic conditions, earnings are up $13 million year-over-year.","In Europe, where I mentioned our demand is down in our home market, we have had to expand our export reach to compensate. And there you can see earnings are flat to slightly down. In India, due to improvement on a number of fronts where we\u2019ve executed well, earnings have also increased by $7 million. So all-in-all the business continues to move forward and produce improved results despite what we all would consider a challenging global environment.","Turning to Ilim on slide 16. The joint venture had another solid quarter of performance, turning in $100 million of operational EBITDA on slightly lower quarterly sales of $520 million due to the significant outage at Bratsk mill that was successfully executed and taken early in the quarter. The board of the JV elected to pay dividend during the quarter of which our share was up 56 million, which that was a good thing.","But due to the 17% evaluation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar during the quarter, Ilim took a non-cash charge of $210 million on it U.S. denominated debt. Now, just a reminder, on the flip side of the unfavorable non-cash FX impact on the JV\u2019s debt, earnings are favorably impacted by a ruble devaluation as -- I can give you a couple of numbers here, as 95% of our cost are on ruble but the vast majority of our exported products, which account for over half of the JV sales are sold in U.S. dollars.","So net-net all-in, the situation in Russia for us remains favorable. Speaking of the favorable conditions, I wanted to take a minute to highlight a significant progress that we're making at the Ilim JV particularly with regard to the productivity ramp up at the Bratsk mill.","As you can see on the chart on the right hand side of the page, Bratsk came into the year at a run rate of a little over 60% of full production for the mill. The team has been making steady progress throughout the year with an achievement of nearly 90% in the third quarter, following the major outage that I said was very successfully taken early in the quarter.","And the team expects to exit the year at full production, averaging mid 90% levels for the fourth quarter. So this is on track with the JVs target for the new pulp line to be fully ramped up by year end.","So let me turn now to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Volume will be lower predominantly due to seasonality, which is simply three less shipping days in the North American box business, which for us translates to roughly 120,000 fewer ton. This will be slightly offset by seasonally stronger conditions in Brazil.","Moving to pricing and mix. We do expect pricing and mix to be lower in our North American paper business, really due to some seasonal weakness. And we also expect lower average export pricing for our containerboard for industrial packaging business. And I will also attribute this due to the normal seasonal weakness that we see this time of the year combined with the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar. And finally we do expect to see lower pricing and less favorable regional mix in Europe and Russia.","We expect operations to continue to perform well in the fourth quarter. We don't expect overall input cost to moderate to any degree in aggregate with anticipated higher wood cost likely offsetting any benefits from lower OCC and energy costs.","Maintenance outages are forecasted to increase by about $60 million sequentially. We expect to see a positive swing from a significant FX charge at the Ilim JV. However, as you all know looking at the ruble today, some of that could be offset by further devaluation that we\u2019ve seen to date. But as our practice has been, we don\u2019t attempt to forecast where the ruble will be at the end of the quarter.","And finally, we assume the tax rate to normalize in -- in line with our full-year outlook and for corporate expenses to come in around $15 million for the fourth quarter given the year-end true up.","So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Sutton","Thanks Carol. So let me just summarize our remarks and wrap it up. IP had a very strong quarter setting records on a number of fronts as we continue to run our businesses very well. While we expect this strong execution to continue, our outlook for the fourth quarter is impacted by fewer shipping days in North American box and $60 million in higher planned maintenance outage expenses.","We are leveraging our well-positioned businesses particularly in the absence of any tailwinds in most markets. Our teams around the globe are executing very well and are continuing to find ways to drive improved results and create value.","Our free cash flow generation continues to be strong and sustainable which is enabling IP to deliver on its capital allocation strategy. We have delivered three consecutive annual double-digit increases in the dividends and today we are within $100 million of completing the original $1.5 billion share buyback program, that was authorized back in September 2013.","We continue to look for value creating opportunities for reinvestment, for example, the recently announced restart project of our number three paper machine at Valliant for our containerboard business, the expansion of our Canton, Ohio foodservice facility and the coated paperboard enhancement project, we completed and are in current ramp up at our Kwidzyn mill in Poland. IP\u2019s financial state is very solid. We remain focused on the execution of the plans we\u2019ve outlined and going forward, we expect to make continued progress toward our key goals.","Before we open it up for questions, I'd like to give you a brief update on where we are with the master limited partnership opportunity. As we said at the UBS conference in September, we moved to a more intensive evaluation phase. We\u2019ve retained a team of external advisors and are actively working with them at this time.","As part of the process of our discovery, we\u2019re also talking to several companies in other industries. We have formed and are operating an MLP in an effort to better understand the process and their experiences. There is a lot of work going on to better understand what an MLP structure might look like specifically for International Paper and whether we would benefit from such a structure and whether we can create value for our shareholders.","I can tell you we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re learning through this process. And as part of our continuing evaluation, it is our intention to file a request with the IRS for the private letter ruling and we\u2019re working with our advisors to get ready to do so.","And with that, we'll be happy to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub.","Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group","Thank you. I hope this is a fair question for quarterly earnings call but Mark, since you've taken over, as IP's CEO and I just wanted to throw this question at you. What do you think are the key levers you can pull to take IP to the next level or put it different way? What are the biggest opportunities that you're looking to act on in the next couple of years?","Mark Sutton","I guess, it\u2019s a fair question, Mark. It\u2019s an obvious one as well. I think we've got a strategy that we\u2019ve embarked upon and we shared with the investment community, we shared with our employees. And we still got more runway on our current strategy and so executing very well against our current plans, which is essentially advantaged positions in paper and packaging globally, creating value for our shareholders. That\u2019s still the important near-term task.","And obviously without being able to predict the future as we go out beyond two years, we\u2019ll have to continue to evaluate where we can create value. And I\u2019m sure, can\u2019t tell you what it will be, but I\u2019m sure International Paper will evolve and will be different in five years than it is today. But the bottom line is we're committed to a strategy of balance used for the cash. We think we can continue to generate healthy cash flow and we\u2019re going to look for ways in a balanced fashion to create value for the long-term.","Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group","And just as quick follow-up and how important is M&A to the strategy and how -- and do you feel that you're somewhat constrained given the various market positions that you already have?","Mark Sutton","I think in general, M&A is obviously a tool in your strategy toolbox. I wouldn\u2019t comment on where we might be constrained or not. But I think IP is not a mergers and acquisition story to create value going forward. As you mentioned, we have strong positions in certain markets but there are opportunities for us to improve what we have. And I think M&A will come out where it comes out based on the opportunities we see in front of us. But all against the backdrop of creating value for the long-term.","Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group","Okay. Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of George Staphos.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. Again, congratulations everyone in their new endeavors. I guess the first question I had on MLPs, Mark, could you comment at all, or Carol, if you could comment on you're more encouraged by what you have found recognizing you still have more work to do. Relative to when you first examined the structure or thought about it to the current time, what has been the biggest source or biggest couple of sources of incremental encouragement or view on how it could create value?","Mark Sutton","George, I will just a make general comment and I will ask Carol to elaborate. I think what we talked about at the UBS Conference, I\u2019ll refer to as learning how this specifically would work in, for example our containerboard business and whether or not, our core principles have been able to run the business effectively, can be maintained is what we're learning and most encouraged about. And as you remember, IP had a master limited partnership in our timberlands business years ago. We weren\u2019t worried about the complexity. We were worried about whether or not the specific applications of this structure in this type of business and the way we need to run the business could work. I think we're learning more about that that a lot of those issues are manageable and Carol, if you would\u2026?","Carol Roberts","Yeah. And I will do it from the other side. The other part we\u2019ve learned is why would IP specifically be attractive to investors in an MLP, and what would they be looking for and what is it that we offer that would be attractive to that investor base and what would that be worth to them, because that\u2019s what ultimately translates back to the value of International Paper. So just learning about the value drivers of MLPs. That\u2019s been -- that we\u2019ve learned a lot and we see some encouraging things from there.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If I could tag on, and again maybe this is preliminary and thus you can't really get to it. Would it be feasible in your view, given your work to date, for other portions of IP to be suitably dropped into the MLP, or have you not gotten to that point yet in terms of your valuation?","Mark Sutton","George, that\u2019s the type detail that we aren\u2019t really prepared to go into. But I can tell you that we\u2019ve got a holistic approach to this and that\u2019s how we are going to continue with it. But specifics about the structure and all that, it\u2019s not the right time right now.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. My last question. I'll turn it over to the rest of the analysts. A couple years ago, you talked about the $5 billion EBITDA goal, the Drive for Five, so to speak. Is it possible to comment in terms of how you gauge your prospects for reaching that given the current structure of IP and the current trends that you have both going for you and against you? Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Mark Sutton","Okay. George. That\u2019s a great question. I mean, we are committed, we laid it out there back in 2012 that we were shooting for a milepost of $5 billion in EBITDA and we are not ready to give up on that. It\u2019s harder to get to and we are getting there in a different way and I think the biggest gap we have is what we describe as mid-cycle conditions or mid-cycle cost and demand environment. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen that yet.","But obviously, as I step into my role, we are rejuvenating our efforts to find additional ways with what we have today to try to get as close to that and look at reaching that target. So that\u2019s our approach. We made a commitment and we are focused on trying to find the way to get there. We knew it would be different than we laid out. We just didn\u2019t know what the actual path would look like. So, aspirational, a little bit but we think we have the company today that with the right conditions, we can achieve that level of performance.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly.","Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities","Thank you. So we're starting to see more capacity announcements in India from local players mostly and you said you're looking more. Have you come to the conclusion that India's a big opportunity? I think in the past, IP has described it as sort of its investment as a learning experience","Mark Sutton","Mark, I will make a general comment about how I kind of personally view India, then I will ask maybe, Tom Kadien to elaborate given his been running and will continue to be responsible. I think you are right. We said India has maybe the potential for the future and we want to start to learn how to do business there. I think we\u2019ve learned some things in the last three years. I wouldn\u2019t say our view has changed dramatically like -- that we see something that we didn\u2019t see two or three years ago. But we do see the potential. We see the potential in the packaging area. And so we\u2019ll be very measured and very careful with what we do in India. But it is still a market that is intriguing and again it\u2019s for the future, not for tomorrow. And Tom and if you would maybe add a few comments.","Tom Kadien","Yeah. Mark, not a lot more to add to that. But it\u2019s three years for us in the paper business over there. We made a lot of strides that have been covered up by wood cost and slowing economy. But I would say we are as optimistic about the fundamental opportunity in India as we were -- when we bought our way into APPM. And I think the capacity announcements that you're talking about are really on the containerboard side. We think that\u2019s also an opportunity for the future, but we\u2019ve got to earn our strides in the paper business first.","Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities","Okay. That's helpful. And second, in the second quarter, John Faraci said that his target was to buy back your stock below intrinsic value. I'm wondering whether you apply that same basic metric to acquisitions with maybe intrinsic value plus expected synergies. I was wondering if Carol could remind us how you do think about acquisition value.","Carol Roberts","Yeah. Mark, clearly our goal on acquisition is to create value which comes quite simply to we use our methodology\u2019s discounted cash flow model, trying to look at all of the cash in for what we can get out of the base business plus synergies. And we want a nice spread between our -- what we view our cost of capital against what the return on that project could be and that\u2019s all around the assumptions you make. And you can make those numbers tell you lots of things. So what we tried to do really hard is we look at cost of capital by region. We don't use one number for the company and we pressure test the assumptions real hard. And quite honestly to make our IP more valuable, we need a nice spread between our cost of capital and the potential return out of those projects. And we have a very robust review process here where we debate it, when we talk about it. And John always encourages us to have multiple of view and I think we\u2019ll continue on path. So, I think you would find us to do the work much like you would expect.","Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Good morning. Could we just start, maybe a little bit on the demand environment, kind of puts and takes, gas prices are down. Are you seeing that flow through to some of your business that might be tied closer to the consumer? Just generally speaking, maybe touch on what you're seeing in Brazil and China as well in paper versus board?","Mark Sutton","So, I think maybe the best way to do that is to have maybe Tim Nicholls talk a little bit as he enters into the Industrial Packaging role, which is obviously the best bellwether we have for general demand environment in economy then we will kind of touch on the other parts?","Tim Nicholls","Sure. Thanks Mark. Good morning, everyone. I think demand\u2019s been pretty stable. We saw our box demand in the quarter just slightly behind where the overall market was, and Carol pointed out the factors between east and west.","If you look at the east, we performed fairly well both in absolute and on a relative basis. So I think demand fills okay here in the U.S. It\u2019s actually been pretty good. Export markets; we did see some seasonal weakness, but I think beyond a seasonal, I think it\u2019s just more of new capacity pushing out some suppliers from North America and other parts of the world. And we bump up in a lot of parts of the world because of the size of the system we are. So we probably got hit by that just a little bit more than maybe others.","If you look at Brazil, Brazil on the paper and on the box side has struggled give them the economic environment. They are technically in recession first two quarters of this year. And it\u2019s been exacerbated on the packaging side of Brazil just because of how some of our biggest customers have been impacted in their markets. They have lost share to local suppliers, which is filtered through the supply chain to us. We will see what happens now. I kind of felt like Brazil had taken a bit of a pause. It was hurt by the World Cup and then it went into a pause waiting on the outcome of the election. The election is behind now. We will see what impact that has on the balance of the year. Fourth quarter tends to be a seasonally stronger quarter both for paper and packaging.","In the paper markets there, the domestic markets have been weak. The export markets around Latin America have been a little more robust, but not the kind of strength that we\u2019ve seen in prior years. But still from how we performed, we are better than market on domestic paper in Brazil and we are kind of flattish on export volume to Latin America.","Mark Sutton","Yeah. I will wrap up the demand comments with China and our demand probably reflects the Chinese economy. It\u2019s slowed down. We still have pockets of positive demand growth, but it doesn\u2019t mirror a 7% plus GDP number that gets published mainly because our demand is really dependent on one component of that GDP and that\u2019s the consumer and\/or exports and both of those or it\u2019s sluggish in China right now. So we don\u2019t see it getting a lot worse right now, it\u2019s just not the level of demand growth that we\u2019re accustomed to.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Okay. And then just on the MLP, I guess you said one of the considerations that you learnt about is the value drivers and what investors would be looking for. Can you give a little bit of insights, certainly one thing investors look for typically is yields driven? And just how you are thinking about the more normalized interest environment might impact the success of an MLP?","Carol Roberts","Sure, Gail. Yes, so it\u2019s MLP 101, so I will be brief, but it\u2019s about the yield, but it\u2019s about the growth rate and it\u2019s about the longevity. And when you think about International Paper with the size and scale of the system we have, we\u2019ve got a lot of EBITDA, lot of cash flow, and so you\u2019ve got growth and you\u2019ve got longevity. And then if you look at the value to the International Paper shareholder, the value comes from your general partner stake and your incentive distribution right stake.","So you\u2019ve got some drivers that could be valuable to International Paper. So then it comes back to what Mark said, okay given those things, if you believe those are real and you\u2019ve got enough experience to see actual examples of that, what would it take to run it in the business we\u2019re in and with the company we have and the structure we have to not violate our true north goals of how we know we want to run the business. So that\u2019s kind of where our learnings have taken. I hope that helps.","Gail Glazerman - UBS","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Philip NG.","Philip Ng - Jefferies","One of your competitors just reported and he sounded a little more upbeat on demand for October based on Tim\u2019s tone it sounds like more the same. So I just want to get some color on that front.","Mark Sutton","Yeah. We are looking at our October. We came out about where we thought we\u2019re going to and kind of in line with what we saw in September. So I would say that it\u2019s fairly consistent, not a big direction one way or the other.","Philip Ng - Jefferies","That\u2019s helpful. And then on the MLP front, as you guys elect to move forward. Carol, can you provide some color how are you thinking about using the cash proceeds? And you commented on why you would move forward be creating value for shareholders. So can you help us understand strategically what\u2019s the game plan on an MLP if you guys do move forward?","Carol Roberts","Yeah, Philip, that\u2019s a great question. And I am not sure this is the right forum to answer it, but clearly one of the things that happens if you went down that path is you would be getting a big influx of cash to International Paper. Now what we do with that cash and where we take that, I mean that\u2019s the question that we continue to think about herein with Mark and the team. So I am not prepared to answer that question, but the multiple arbitrage is really the key thing that enables the flow of that cash in.","Philip Ng - Jefferies","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just switching gear to Ilim, you saw some price slippage in the quarter. Is that starting to stabilize and how should we be thinking about the cadence of the EBIT progression of that business, especially considering the ramp up for production is going to be pretty close to full production year end?","Carol Roberts","Phil, this is Carol. And I think on the appendix slide where we had Ilim in there and I am going to go to it pretty quickly if I can. I think what you see there is you see some whole price down quarter-over-quarter. There is a lot of mix in that for Ilim.","Philip Ng - Jefferies","Okay.","Carol Roberts","It\u2019s got hardwood in it. It\u2019s got different grades of the softwood, different quality grades. So I would not react to that too strongly. I think the markets are pretty strong and pretty stable. And we feel pretty good about the outlook for softwood pulp.","Philip Ng - Jefferies","Okay. All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chip Dillon.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you very much. First question is on your view toward what maybe CapEx looks like in 2015. I know you probably haven\u2019t finished your budgeting, but at least maybe directionally as you look at some of the projects or the pipeline how could that look versus this year?","Carol Roberts","Well, Chip, I would say that it is a little early to predict that. When we do the fourth quarter results and we talk about those in late January, we will give some color on that. But I would say that generally speaking, we have a pipeline of really good ideas that we need to think about how do we want to fund those ideas that are some really some good value creating opportunities. And when the time comes, we will speak to those.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. And at least versus expectations and modeling, we need to give the white paper business a little bit of credit this quarter. It looked very good. And I had a question on that segment. One concern a lot of investors have had has been the impact of imports that seem to have stopped some of the pricing momentum this year. And some of the import increases of course have come from Brazil and we were just kind of wondering, it would make a lot of sense that you guys might have sent a lot of paper up from you operations down there with the Courtland closure. And maybe with the benefit of hindsight not all of those tons were necessarily needed or customers have made other arrangements. Do you see the import situation changing at all, especially given the freight costs and the distances involved from other countries?","Tim Nicholls","Hey, Chip, it\u2019s Tim. Let me just tackle imports in general first and I will come back to Brazil. Imports in general, if you go back and you look at 2013 data kind of quarter by quarter or month by month, imports had started coming in the first half of last year. And as we were making decisions about our system and our footprint here, we were taking to account what imports we are doing and what customers were telling us their intentions were about additional imports.","Now having said that, you referenced freight costs and they are definitely up and that has a big impact on the viability of imports, especially if they go up and they stay there for a long period of time as does currency.","But the other piece of it is just supply chain, its not uncommon to be managing the supply chain that might be four or five months long, given imports and where they have to come from and the planning that goes into it versus 30 days or 40 days from domestic supplier like ourselves.","With regards to Brazil, we do not import paper into the U.S. -- for distribution in the U.S. from Brazil. We do send paper here to traders that take it back out and distribute it for us in the Latin American region. And reason we do that is because of customer mix in some cases and because of quantities that are ordered. So it\u2019s just more efficient for us to ship into Miami and have it redistribute it back out into the regions, because our partner manages a very efficient supply chain and it is for us to try to do all of that ourselves. We have some direct shipments into South American region but we also go through distribution as well.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And one last quick one, I think, Mark, you mentioned that you had done all the first original authorization in terms of the buyback, except for $100 million and just a clarification, was that as of September 30th or as of for example today?","Mark Sutton","Chip, if I could before that question is answered. Just on the imports into Miami, you should keep in mind that there are other imports that come into that part of the U.S. for redistribution as well. So everything that comes into, say the Port of Miami or on the West Coast into some of the southern ports, it doesn\u2019t all stay here necessarily.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","And I guess, those would both be shown in the AF and PA data as imports and exports?","Mark Sutton","Not always. No. That\u2019s the problem.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay.","Mark Sutton","\u2026 because of the way reporting is done.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","I see.","Tom Kadien","On your question about the share buyback, the $1.4 billion actual against the $1.5 billion authorizations through today.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steve Chercover.","Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson","Thank you. Good morning. First question, the margins in North Americans container board are really terrific and you\u2019ve said, you intend to maintain that? As one, A, how much run rate do you have on that optimization plan, and B, is it possible that it get too good because folks lower margins can still earn their cost of capital?","Tim Nicholls","Hi. Steve, it is Tim. Too good, I think, it depends on how, where the improvement comes from, so we said, earlier this year that optimization was going to take us a couple of maybe two to three years. If it\u2019s internal improvement than I think, it\u2019s probably more sustainable than if it comes from other places.","Having said that, you look at -- just take a broader chunk of time because third quarter was wide on outages. You can still see margin and expansion, and I think, that\u2019s coming from how we run the box system, how we\u2019re managing supply chain. What\u2019s not coming through, just yet, but I think, its coming over the near-term is the mill system. We were better in the mills and we did perform well in the quarter, but some of the mills were acquired.","We know have reliability issues and those reliability issues cost us and we\u2019re underway correcting those. But it also has an impact on supply chain too, because when you can\u2019t produce product in he mill of choice based on geography, it causes you to sub-optimize the system. So I say it playing out just as we characterized it in the past over the next couple of years.","Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson","Okay. And switching gears, I imagine you got to be rather frustrated with what\u2019s going on in Asia or China specifically, I mean, year in year out there is really no contributions. So I\u2019m wondering how long you tolerate that or is there a means by which you could maybe extract your capital?","Mark Sutton","","So, Steve, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s frustrating to, especially for our team on the ground there to deal with difficult market conditions, but we\u2019re in these businesses for the long-term, and if and when we would make a decision that we don\u2019t think, we can get to a position that we like, then we\u2019d be prepare to talk about strategic changes.","But I think this is a time where as leaders of the company, you have to have perseverance, you have to take the long view and we have a company that\u2019s not everything is going to be hitting on all cylinders that the exact same time.","So, I think, we will continue to evaluate our businesses around the globe and in North America, and that\u2019s just part of our role to make sure that we continue to stay flexible and nimble and position the company for the future.","And the Asian markets are in a little bit of a downturn right now, but there\u2019s a lot of future potential in those market for paper and forest products companies and a lot of other industries. So we have a modest position there by all measures and we will continue to evaluate.","Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson","Okay. And just forgive me. It\u2019s terrific that you\u2019ve executed as you have on the repo? Did you reop that, I think you did.","Carol Roberts","Yeah. Steve, we did. We -- the Board authorized an additional $1.5 billion in July.","Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson","I thought so. Thanks for assisting my senior moment. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to come back to MLP point, obviously, the IRS and the moratorium but once that\u2019s lifted, if hypothetically you were to get a favorable ruling on the PLR? I mean, do you think you\u2019ve done enough work around what the structure would look like operationally, where you can say that you're comfortable that if you could get a favorable PLR from the IRS, you would move towards MLP structure for the containerboard business?","Mark Sutton","Alex, I think it\u2019s probably premature to get into that. I mean, as I said in the beginning and Carol elaborated on. We\u2019re still working through it. So, I think at the appropriate time in the process, we would be able to talk more about that.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s fair, Mark. And then would you be able to tell us, what\u2019s your box shipments were in October. And just a follow-on to that question, if I look at last year, there was a meaningful step-up in the downtime for the North American industrial business in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Can you give us a sense of how we should be thinking about that number this year?","Tim Nicholls","Hey, Alex, this is Tim. Our October shipments, we are still wrapping up the months. So if we just look at daily cut-off and how we performed in our box plans, I think it feels a lot like September and we finished on a little bit stronger in September than the rest of the quarter. In terms of outage, we don't forecast going forward. We have to look and see what our demand signal looks like and then we plan accordingly.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs","Appreciate the color, Tim. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup","Good morning. I had a question on input costs. You took a hit from higher wood costs, but OCC prices have been really weak and understanding that you're not giving guidance. As you look forward, do you think that we could be -- do you expect the OCC to pick up, or could we be looking at another 6 months, 12 months for OCC as a $100 or below $100? And is the price of OCC is something that concerns you from the perspective of potentially incenting new containerboard capacity in the U.S.?","Carol Roberts","Anthony, this is Carol. I think, speaking for the team, I think the OCC, it would be very difficult for us to predict where OCC is in six months because there is going to be really all around global demand and global economic activity. So, I think what you're seeing there is just a sheer result of the demand for OCC. But over time, we are convinced that it will cost more in the future than it cost today.","And so we think it goes up higher through time. And if you're making a decision on a containerboard machine, recycled containerboard machine, you\u2019re not going to make it on the stock price on OCC. You\u2019re going to make it over a long-term decision around, what do I have to pay for my input materials, what am I going to sell my products and importantly whom I going to sell it to. And that\u2019s the strategic question that any investor would have to make around on your containerboard machine. And I think, I answered your question but if there was another one in there, I\u2019ve had my own senior moment, I can't recall it.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup","No. That was -- I think you covered it. That was helpful. And then just maybe following up on North American box markets and specifically box prices, I mean, you saw stable box prices in the quarter, talked about October looking good. Some trade publications have talked about discounting in boxes. And I\u2019m just wondering, if you\u2019ve seen any of that kind of discounting in the marketplace in a real way? Or if you could just talk about competitive conditions in North American box markets, maybe how they\u2019ve changed, if they\u2019ve changed in the last three, four months?","Tim Nicholls","Hi. It\u2019s Tim. We were relatively flat in the quarter and we don\u2019t forecast price going forward. But this is a seasonally slower period of time and it\u2019s a competitive market. So we will update you when we get through the fourth quarter.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson.","Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Congratulations on your performance in the quarter and Mark, best of luck in your new role. One on export. In terms of the export price weakness that you are guiding to in the fourth quarter, how much of that would you say seasonal versus reflective of current conditions, and how would you characterize export conditions, just a moment given the recent strength in U.S. dollar and the weakness in a number of economies as I think, Carol talked about earlier.","Tim Nicholls","Yeah. Hi, it\u2019s Tim. It really depends on what projects you are talking about. If it\u2019s containerboard, there is an element of seasonality in that. There\u2019s how regions are producing around the world and then there is -- as I mentioned earlier, some capacities that\u2019s probably left, North America and it\u2019s finding its way to other parts of the world, So probably half and half.","On the paper side, this is a seasonally slower period of time and we usually do see some export price erosion. As we go to the fourth quarter in certain parts of the world, as I mentioned in Brazil, the fourth quarter tends to be a seasonally stronger period. So overall, it\u2019s probably going to be down but I don\u2019t expect big decreases.","Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks, Tim. And just one on the capacity -- containerboard capacity additions in North America. How would you characterize the impact that they\u2019ve had, both on your business and on the market? Obviously, your margins in North America industrial packaging are as high as they have ever been, but we continue to read about pricing pressure, both domestically and in terms of export containerboard prices. Thanks very much.","Mark Sutton","Sure. I wouldn\u2019t comment on how it impacts the market. I can tell you how it\u2019s impacted us. We haven\u2019t seen a big impact on volume. And I think you have to keep in mind that all of this capacity is not the same. You\u2019ve got different levels of quality in some cases and you\u2019ve also got basis weights that are fit for use, not necessarily more broadly applicable to all segments.","And you\u2019ve got geographies in some cases. They come and play as well. So we haven\u2019t seen a big volume impact. We run a very large system that has a lot of channel access across different channels with a lot of different products. So we bring a different type of value proposition to our customers that some of these new capacity starting up just can\u2019t because of what they have to offer.","Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of Debbie Jones.","Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank","","Hi. Good morning. My first questions, just like to talk about OCC for a minute. Just recognizing it\u2019s difficult to kind of predict this. Do you have any thoughts on the trajectory for recycle fiber pricing and I know on recent call you\u2019ve mentioned China having less of reliance on the U.S. has been an issue. What kind of trends should we be thinking about over the near term on OCC pricing?","Mark Sutton","Well, Carol gave an answer a minute ago that I would be hard to contradict. She said it\u2019s really hard to point where OCC goes over the longer period of time. I think that\u2019s right. It depends on what the level of demand in China is going to be and other parts of world.","Tim Nicholls","So Debbie, let me see if I can help, maybe more satisfying -- a little more satisfying. There is a cost curve for OCC, collection cost curve and you start getting into below $100 and you start to take a fly out of the market place because the cost more to collect and it does the selling price. And so I think if you think about where it is today, the trajectory ought to be up with any kind of economic improvement across the world. So there is tax over the bracket when it becomes uneconomical to collect the high cost OCC.","Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks. Apologies. I guess from my senior moment in the repeat question I guess -- my follow-up I guess would be on MLPs -- it\u2019s more of the process question. If you could comment on this, you submit the application and I\u2019m assuming you are trying to get having review various craft assets and whether or not they have MLP qualifying incoming. The IRS, what type of due diligence do they do when you submit the PLR? Are they actually coming out and visiting your operations or do they tend to look at kind of industry definition and things like that?","Carol Roberts","Debbie, this is Carol. I\u2019m not aware that they would come, do a visit. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s what they would do. And I think they would base it upon your submission of the fact that you represented and they could always research those facts and verify those were performed by point of view.","Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll pass it over.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Good morning.","Mark Sutton","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Just looking at your corrugated shipments in the quarter. I realized West of the Rockies, you are more heavily exposed to the agricultural markets. But I think I recall before you are going to try to maybe mitigate some of that by moving it to some other end markets. One, are you making any progress moving into other end markets and two, as we go into 2015, I mean, it\u2019s look like some of those issue in the ag market aren\u2019t going abate. Are there any measures you could take to sort of change your customer mix there to mitigate some of that some of those issues?","Tim Nicholls","Yeah. Hi. It\u2019s Tim. I\u2019m not sure about the question around the market segment shifts and what not. I mean we\u2019re talking about a lot of volume. We\u2019re talking about a big market in California. So it\u2019s really hard to impact that on the meaningful way in short term and I don\u2019t how long the drought is going to last. And you would think that at some point the drought situation will reverse itself and we\u2019ll see some uplift on the comfortable basis but what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re competing in all the segments that we play in.","We\u2019ve got big protein segments. We\u2019ve got big segment and processed foods. And so we\u2019re working all of those segments hard across the country and we\u2019re faced in the last, situation where there is just not -- there is much demand because the product not there to be packaged.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Okay. But working at your shipments there versus the industry, you\u2019re down 3.7% industry at 1% of that. Is that purely overweighting towards ag or is there something else going on?","Mark Sutton","Yeah. Sorry. I missed that part of your question. Maybe my senior moment, yeah, I mean there is more than just ag in the west in the industrial business. But we tend to be overweighted to the ag segment in that part of the country?","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Right. Is that something where maybe an acquisition would help you to balance out the end market exposure there?","Tim Nicholls","I don\u2019t think you look at acquisitions for situational factors that impact demand. We\u2019re running our business and we would look at the way Carol talked about if there was one that made sense. And we thought the growth in intrinsic value but we\u2019re running the business day-to-day and trying to optimize what we have.","Mark Sutton","Okay. Got the biggest lever we had as Tim mentioned earlier is the channel distribution strategy that we have, domestic containerboard in the open market where we have top notch customers, our own box business and of course our export markets. And that allows us to move containerboard through this channel. So at the West Coast ag business is difficult while we\u2019ve got other outlets and that\u2019s what we do on the ongoing basis. It\u2019s really maximize our flow through through different channels to market because all of those channels are permanent channels for IP that we viewed strategically.","Tim Nicholls","And as I mentioned, we don\u2019t expect the ag segment on the West Coast to be down for ever. It will comeback.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Right. Now I hear on that argument. We\u2019ve been just waiting for above average harvest around food can for three or four years now. So\u2026","Tim Nicholls","Right.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","That\u2019s where the concern is coming from there. Just moving over to consumer for a minute on cup stock, can you talk about any continued improvement in the uptick there? On -- I think may be you are adding some capacity but also from a consumer -- from a customer demand perspective, are you seeing any continued switch from phone to paper?","Tom Kadien","Yes, Scott this is Tom Kadien. We see robust demand growth in our food service business. And we are I think our volumes are up high single-digits year-over-year and we still have customers who are moving geographies and moving products out of foam and into paper and that\u2019s driving our volumes that\u2019s why we are expanding Canton, Ohio plant to add capacity for the back half next year because we still see that trend moving in our direction and that\u2019s pulling through a lot of cups talk through our coated board business as well.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Great. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Our last question is from the line of Al Kabili.","Al Kabili - Macquarie Securities","All right. Thanks. Good morning. Carol just housekeeping question for you is on the pension. If you had any preliminary thoughts around what the lower discount rate and change in mortality tables might mean for your pension expense next year more broadly and also as how you define operational pension expense?","Carol Roberts","So, Al, good morning. So on pension, let me just comment from clearly the discount rate as of December 31st will impact the accounting side of the pension, it will not impact the cash required contribution side. The law that got passed legislation of the summer will trump all of that and the required contribution that we are looking at now for '15 and '16 is in aggregate probably round number a $100 million in totalish. So it's a very small amount. So the impact on the discount rate will be a balance sheet and a credit metric issue by itself.","Relative to the mortality table, they will come in, they're not sure of the exact day when all that hits, but I thinks its '16 or '17, some thing like that. And clearly when the lifespan is longer, the liability will go up from that, but we -- I am not prepared to give any preliminary math on that. And then the operating pension expense which you referred to that flows through the business P&L.","Operating pension expense is really the cost of providing that benefit, taking out the kind of swings that come from the accounting. So it\u2019s a benefit that we provide to our employees. There is cost associated with that and that flows through the businesses. On the non-operating, it\u2019s the kind of things like the change in liability, the change in interest rates, all that kind of stuff that\u2019s really accounting driven. And that\u2019s why we separated the two not to distort our operating performance.","Al Kabili - Macquarie Securities","Right. And understanding you are not prepared to give the change in mortality table update just yet as far as quantifying. But it sounds like it\u2019s probably not going to have that much of an impact on the operating pension expense if I understand it correctly, Carol?","Carol Roberts","No, I will tell you the truth that we have done it more from an overall liability perspective. We have not moved it back through to the operating line, but it certainly won't be an impact in '15 and I think it would become an impact in '16, '17. And I don\u2019t think it will be.","Al Kabili - Macquarie Securities","Okay. Appreciate it. Understood. Okay. And then just last question. Just more broadly on to the team and just the emerging markets. And clearly the macro has been a struggle, but if we look at India and we look at Brazil or so, those businesses have been challenged by cost inflation the last few years.","And I wanted to just get a sense to the pulse on the opportunity just to improve the performance next year on those businesses irrespective of the macro and just catching up to some of those cost inflation what the outlook is there?","Tim Nicholls","Yeah. Hi, it's Tim. Just on Brazil and then I'll pass it off to Tom Kadien for India or so. Yes, the environment is challenging, but even with the challenging environment this past quarter we were still getting price increases. The big level for us is really around cost structure, especially in the box plans. We\u2019re spending low capital dollars or significant automation opportunities that takes out headcount. So will end up taking out this year probably the better part of our 160 people across the system. And we think there is more opportunity as you go into 2015.","On the volume side, if you look at the business absent these three multinational customers that we have that have lost share, we\u2019re kind of holding our own. We are just faced with the additional challenge of in a soft market trying to replace the tons that we\u2019ve lost through those customers. But I think we are making headway on it. So I expect an improved fourth quarter from a margin standpoint. Third quarter was very heavy to outages, which impacted us and expanding margins of '15, '16.","Mark Sutton","And on the India side, there is a lot of optimism in India right now with the changing government and we\u2019ve seen some tangible signs that give us optimism as well about the macro environment. We expect demand -- our GDP to drive demand and GDP is going to increase next year over the issuers 5.5% or what for so. Fiber prices which have been an issue are coming down.","So that spells good for earnings. And we\u2019ve also gotten -- with this new government, we\u2019ve gotten some consents approved on additional capacity that will help us grow the business next year. So we feel really pretty upbeat about our paper business in India.","Al Kabili - Macquarie Securities","Okay. Terrific and good luck the remainder of the year.","Mark Sutton","Okay. I think that will wrap us up here. I would just like to make a couple of closing comments. At IP, we expect to continuously improve. We hold ourselves as leaders accountable for that. We are going to focus on our customers. It\u2019s even more important than slow economic times to really redouble our efforts to be better and better with customers. We will continue to focus on improvement and how we operate. You saw a lot of the evidence of being able to do that and bring it to the bottomline in the third quarter.","Our focus on good sustainable cash flow will remain. And balanced use of that cash that rewards our shareholders will be the principles that we continue to operate going forward. We have great group of employees that are engaged in winning and winning with customers and outperforming the competition all over the world. And it\u2019s a privilege for me to have the opportunity to lead International Paper. And I look forward to speaking with all of you on a regular basis going forward.","Jay Royalty","Thanks, Mark.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Landau, you may begin your conference.","Glenn Landau","Thank you, Christy, and good morning. And thank you for joining International Paper's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are John Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","On Page 2, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2012 earnings press release and today's presentation slides.","Lastly, given our expanded disclosure around our Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides some context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures.","So with that, I will now turn the call over to John Faraci.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everybody. And thanks for calling in. Okay, let me just start off by saying the second quarter was a solid result for International Paper. Temple is -- the integration is going very, very well. The acquisition was meaningfully accretive in the second quarter. That's only 3.5 months -- 4.5 months into the acquisition. The world is going sideways in terms of the environment we're operating in. I think kind of everybody understands that. But the good thing is, International Paper isn't done. We've got a lot of headroom, a lot of levers we're pulling. We're running our business and executing well, but we're laying the platform and the groundwork, and we'll talk about the during the call, for things that are going to meaningfully improve International Paper as we move out of 2012 and into 2013.","Just looking at our results for the quarter, we increased our EBITDA in the second quarter to close to $880 million, continued to generate strong free cash flow from operations. The biggest single lever during the quarter was the impact of the Temple integration. And as Carol will outline shortly, we're well ahead of plan and exceeding our targets on most all metrics. In the 5 months since closing, we can say the acquisition is meaningfully accretive. We've got all of our peak outages behind us. Second quarter was a peak quarter. We executed just about flawlessly during the quarter on those outages and operated our assets well, saw some modest price recovery that was in line with our expectations. Didn't see much change in the demand environment you all [ph] netted out. The Franklin fluff pulp mill came up as we expected it would late in the second quarter, and we continued to make a lot of progress on a number of strategically important projects which will meaningfully impact earnings as we move out of 2012 and in 2013. And we'll cover those later as well.","So given a largely balanced input cost environment, no real changes there, other than seasonal outages, the only other headwind we had during the quarter was a very large unfavorable noncash foreign exchange swing associated with the Ilim joint venture, and that's really what happens when the ruble weakens. It impacts our joint venture earnings, but as Carol will show you on an operating basis, Ilim results were about the same as they were in the first quarter, and we're off the lag now.","So with that, let me just turn to Slide 6, which is the financial snapshot. Revenues were up 6% in the quarter, mainly due to the Temple acquisition. We saw a slight bit of EBITDA compression year-over-year. More than half of that was explained by the higher outages, second quarter this year versus second quarter last year, the onetime startup costs that we incurred in Franklin during the quarter, which were meaningful, and lower pulp prices, which were largely offset by the Temple accretion. But as I said earlier, cash from operations before special items continued to grow, both on a quarter-over-quarter basis and a year-over-year basis, and that's what's really important.","So Carol, let me turn it over to you to talk about the businesses.","Carol L. Roberts","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me move you to Slide 7. And taking a look at the second quarter financial bridge from the first quarter, we earned $0.46 per share from continuing operations before special items. While volume in our consolidated businesses was flat, we did see modest price improvement of about $0.05 per share across our global Paper and Packaging business. This was largely driven by the partial pass-through of our announced North American Printing Papers increases, as well as successful paper increases that we implemented in Brazil and Russia. And on a positive, we also saw the pass-through of our announced export containerboard price increase, which was very much in line with our expectations.","If you take a look at the operations and cost line, we did have higher startup costs at Franklin, and I'll come back to that on a later slide, but they were more than offset by what I would characterize as very good global mill operations and some lower corporate expenses.","A key point that John mentioned and is going to be a theme of today is relative to Temple-Inland, full quarter earnings were really meaningfully accretive as we added $50 million in synergy or $0.08 per share in the quarter. Two headwinds that we had that stand out pretty clearly were the incremental outage-related expenses, and this was our peak quarter for that, as well as our share of the Ilim JV earnings, which were unfavorably impacted by currency exchange. And I have a very good chart on Ilim that will really clearly lay that out.","If I take a look at the global input costs on Slide 8, costs were largely balanced quarter-over-quarter, and we saw, clearly, the benefit of lower natural gas prices, which were offset by higher recovered fiber costs. As the quarter came to the close, everybody sees these 2 things switching. So what we've got now is we've got some upward pressure on natural gas, fiber is coming down. And as we look forward, we see those 2 basically canceling each other out into the third quarter.","Let me move now to Slide 9 and talk about Industrial Packaging. Industrial Packaging posted a very strong second quarter in 2012, generating $367 million in earnings, and that compares extremely favorably to the $278 million that we posted in the first quarter of '12 and also the $269 million that we posted in the second quarter of '11. The quarter's earnings were favorably impacted by a full quarter of Temple-Inland earnings and synergies, solid operational and seasonally improved demand. We saw our box demand up about 1% versus the first quarter.","The other thing that we saw in the second quarter, which we will see for us ongoing in the second quarter, is a seasonally strong mix for us, given that we are a fairly significant player in the fruit -- fresh fruit and vegetable market.","In addition to the U.S. seasonal demand, global containerboard demand for us remained strong throughout the quarter, and our open market export shipments were up nearly 15% versus the first quarter. The business met this total demand by running our system at about 94% capacity, and we also managed our inventory down through the quarter by about 40,000 tons.","And finally, domestic containerboard prices have been stable. As I mentioned earlier, the business did realize the pass-through of our previously announced export containerboard price increases in the quarter.","As always, a great metric to look at in the industry is our EBITDA margins. And so to put our Industrial Packaging results into perspective, Slide 10 shows that our North American EBITDA margins improved versus the best of the competitive set again this quarter. And this, I think, is the ultimate measure that demonstrates the progress that we are continuing to make running our operations, both operationally and commercially, as well as, no doubt, the tangible impact of bringing Temple-Inland synergies to the bottom line. And I just want to kind of make the point, you have to -- if the history was here, we would know that the Temple-Inland margins that we inherited were well below International Paper margin. So I think this is the clear evidence that the synergies have made their way to the bottom line.","Slide 11. As we shared in the first quarter, depicts Temple-Inland's post-close EBIT, and this is, of course, after step-up depreciation before special items and onetime costs. What's really exciting about this chart is with the $50 million of incremental synergies achieved quarter-over-quarter, we clearly are accretive in the transaction, and this is only 4.5 months into the integration.","On another note, going forward, while we'll certainly continue to keep everybody posted on synergy progress, we'll no longer be breaking out the EBIT of the former Temple-Inland facility. And this is quite honestly due to the fact that we have integrated so quickly that the systems have become blended. We're moving board around, we're moving customers around, we're moving grades around. And as we view it, we have 1 business today.","On Slide 12, you can see that while significant progress has been made on all 4 key synergy buckets, really, over 80% of the total synergies today are reductions in overhead and box business improvements, primarily associated with efficiencies, cost and system streamlining. So just to reinforce where we are, our annualized synergy run rate is now $240 million as measured against our upwardly revised target that we told you about of $400 million. And we said that, that $400 million would be achieved by the end of 2013. We're very positive we were more than halfway there in the very early months of the integration, but we've got more room to go. And I would call this a truly impressive start for the newly combined team led by Mark Sutton.","Let me move off of Industrial Packaging and move to our Consumer Packaging segment, where operating profits were $63 million in the second quarter, and that compares to $96 million in the first quarter of '12. You can see the big item is the peak maintenance outage expenses, which really were a large factor in the quarter, somewhat compounded by, as I would categorize, continued soft consumer demand, and this combination resulted in a bit higher cost. On a very positive part of our Consumer Packaging business is the Foodservice business, which had a strong quarter, driven by seasonality. And what's probably the best differentiator is the continued growth in the new product line, primarily our trademark Hold&Go insulated paper cup that is used for hot beverages.","Even in spite of some of those headwinds, relative to our competition, the North American business continued to outperform the best of the competitive set in the quarter.","Moving on to Slide 15. Let me talk now about the Printed Paper segment, where operating earnings were $106 million in the second quarter of '12 compared to $145 million in the prior quarter. Printing Papers, like Consumer Packaging, was also disproportionately impacted by heavy maintenance outages in the quarter. And it's worth noting that in this chart, there was actually higher startup costs at Franklin, actually, sequentially, $10 million more from first to second quarter. And as you can see, these costs were offset by what I would categorize as a very solid operational quarter in the rest of the business.","I think it will be worthwhile to take a look, stepping back at the Printed Paper segment, and taking a look at what's impacting it from a year-over-year basis. And so this chart is first half '11 versus first half of '12. And as you can see, the biggest driver of the year-over-year change is the weaker pricing environment for pulp, so pulp is $105 million negative swing year-over-year, of which about $60 [ph] million of that is pricing and the balance of it is the cost for the startup, the ramp-up of Franklin. So I would talk about the Printing Papers like this. Outside of the pulp and the outages, I would categorize North American papers as performing in line with last year and -- as well as Europe and Brazil. So really, a very solid performance underneath the pulp statistics and the outages.","Moving to Slide 17. As John stated earlier, we're very pleased to announce that on June 29, the fluff pulp began at Franklin. And what's very positive there is that we once again are a meaningful employer in the region. And we've had a very positive ramp-up, which I'd like to talk about on Slide 18. And this depicts our expectations. Given some very early indications of the productivity that we're seeing, the excellent initial product quality, the team is targeting an accelerated fluff pulp ramp-up in the second half of '12. And this is one of the good earnings runways that we have in the business.","Moving on to distribution, xpedx, we did see year-over-year margin improvement, driven by a more profitable segment and customer mix, as well as cost savings. And those cost savings are associated with both our procurement efforts, as well as the asset utilization transformation initiatives which have been underway. And the good news is, these have more than offset the challenging demand environment for commercial printing.","With that said, it's clear the job's not done, and our team in xpedx expects to achieve further cost and margin improvement over the next 18 months, in line with the plan outlined at Investor Day.","In keeping with our commitment to provide a very transparent view on Ilim, here are the Ilim JV financials as we approach the completion of the capital buildout. This shows the JV's consolidated results on an IFRS basis. We have the operating results, the operational EBITDA before FX, as well as the FX impact that takes it all the way down to IP's after-tax earnings. And clearly, the results here are mixed. We have very solid shipments year-over-year, more than offset by lower softwood pulp prices in China. And although pulp prices did recover briefly in the second quarter, they receded again during the quarter. I think pulp prices seem to be finding their bottom now, but it'll take some months for steady growth in China to pull down the demand until pricing starts to recover.","So Slide 20. Let me summarize before I turn it back to John. I would say that we clearly had a solid second quarter in large part due to our excellent progress integrating Temple-Inland and despite being a peak maintenance outage quarter. John is going to talk about it, but as our strategic projects come online and add to our earnings engine, we continue to feel positive about our ability to expand our margins globally and to grow our business in the platforms that we've invested in.","One other note that's not on the chart that I think that's worth mentioning, we did have a positive impact from the highway bill as we talked about in Investor Day. And we had pointed out about a $500 million required contribution to the pension plan for '13. With the highway bill, this looks like it will be less than $100 million, allowing us to take those funds and work on reducing balance sheet debt versus putting it into the pension plan.","So now, what I'd like to do is turn it back over to John to talk a little bit about the strategic earning drivers, as well as our outlook for the third quarter.","John V. Faraci","Thanks, Carol. Let me just go through some of these strategic projects because I think they are, as I said, are setting the stage for more levers for International Paper to pull to improve our business as we move out of 2012 into '13. And I'll talk to what we expect to be happening during the third quarter.","First, Franklin, we're up and running, as Carol said. In xpedx, which is not a big capital project, it's more of a strategic repositioning, we're making -- starting to ramp up on both the procurement side and the realignment of warehouse side. The sales side is a struggle because of what's happening in commercial print, but Mary Laschinger will be on the call at the end when we do the third quarter to give you an update on that. But we're starting to see -- get some traction there.","We've got a big boiler project going on down in Mogi Gua\u00e7u, which moves us close to energy self-sufficiency at that facility in Brazil. And as we move into the third quarter, we're on schedule and are ahead of schedule and on budget. We may be able to bring that up before the end of the year.","At the Sun JV, where we've -- building our fourth coated board machine, the project is well underway. There's a picture on the next page that shows what's happening there. As you can see, we just about got the machine built. We'll be starting that up on schedule during the third quarter.","At Ilim, where we got 2 big capital projects going on, one a new paper machine at Koryazhma, in the third quarter, we'll be running the converting equipment. The fourth quarter, we expect to be starting up the paper machine. At Bratsk, where we're building a new fiber line and basically upgrading that mill in a lot of areas, the woodyard is complete, and we'll be starting up the recovery boiler in the third quarter and getting ready to bring on the pulp dryer in the fiber line toward the end of the year.","And in India, we've got the first major outage they've ever had at the facility under IP ownership behind us, 34 days long, and we're already seeing a 10% improvement in pulp production per day. And the good news about India is we can sell all we can make, so that's a good place to be with -- in that business. So I think on the strategic project front, execution is going well, and these initiatives are started -- we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and they're starting to get to the completion point.","So let me move now to what is the third quarter outlook, changes from the second quarter. It's mostly yellow and mostly stable. The big changes there, we will have less outages during the quarter by about $130 million. We've got the divestiture impact of the 3 mills that we sold. That's roughly $30 million, Carol, in a quarter. There is some green here. We don't expect a currency impact. Again, we don't expect the Russian ruble to continue to weaken. As I said, a lot of the maintenance outage stuff is green. And Franklin should start to contribute cash now that we're running and start to ramp up the fluff pulp line. And basically, everything else is kind of more of the same going sideways.","So I think I'll just stop right there and not go through all these -- all the yellow boxes. But again, just to summarize, International Paper is going to continue to outperform. Looking at our margins, as Carol pointed out, the key businesses in North America, I can see -- I think you could see that margins are -- number one, they're strong; and number two, we're doing better than our competitors. The synergies from Temple are coming more and faster, and they're not CapEx-driven. They're really execution-driven. We feel good about the -- and positive about the containerboard and box price increase that we announced earlier in the week. That's going to start to show up in the fourth quarter. And I think I'll end just where I started. I think it's -- IP is very well-positioned, and the message here is, we aren't done. We've got lots of levers to pull as we approach our potential, even in a global demand environment that's a lot more sluggish than we'd like it to be. As we look at the world, we don't see a repeat of 2008 and '09, but we see pretty sluggish growth. But as far as we can see, which isn't very far, but we're prepared to outperform in that kind of environment.","So I think we'll stop right there and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on Temple-Inland synergies, obviously, off to a great start here. The $400 million that you've talked about, how conservative would you say that is at this stage, just given what you've been able to do so far? I know you talked about the $200 million in optimization opportunities later on, but is there upside to the $400 million as well? Or should we be shifting to the optimization from here?","John V. Faraci","Well, I'll let Mark Sutton talk about how he feels about that because he's sitting right across from me and is running the business. But I'd say we revised our target up. We had Investor Day in May, and we feel pretty good about -- we feel very good about where we're at. And we'll take a look as we go through the quarters, where we're at. And if we have more good news to tell you about, we will.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Yes. Phil, if you remember what we said at Investor Day when we broke out the $400 million in synergies, some of those synergies were -- we had line of sight to and we thought we could do it in 24 months, and we happened to be doing it a little bit quicker than we thought. But there were some other things we talked about that have either mill outages tied to them on the manufacturing side or it could be in the commercial area where you just take -- it takes more time. And so we talked about that being in the post-synergy but merger benefit and optimization time period. I think that's where we still feel it'll be. Carol mentioned, 80% of the synergies are in -- so far, in our overhead reduction and fixed cost and operating improvements in the box business. And so, of course, that overhead reduction is not going to continue limitlessly. We've done a lot of that a lot quicker than we thought because we were able to execute, for example, pulling the supply chain teams together, but faster than we thought we could.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And then just again on containerboard, maybe you could talk about the trends you're seeing here in July, both from a demand and from a supply standpoint for your own system. Would your expectation be in July that inventories will be up or down? Just kind of how are you progressing here? And also, are you seeing any demand pull forward as a result of the announced price increases?","Mark Stephan Sutton","So with respect to what we've seen so far in July, it's about what we expected for our business. Carol mentioned earlier that we have a pretty big position in fresh food and produce, and, of course, that strong season is in the second quarter. So we see some seasonal changes in our mix and demand. We expected that, and we're seeing that. As far as how we're looking at inventories, most of our outages are behind us, so we don't see any reason to build inventories. And we're going to continue to make the board we need for the orders we have in the box system. And what we see is about what we expected as we start the third quarter.","John V. Faraci","Do you want to comment about export demand?","Mark Stephan Sutton","That's a good point, John. Export demand, I would say, has been a bright spot. We had a very strong second quarter. We see export demand for kraft liner, I'm speaking about, actually, continuing to improve pretty much in all the regions we serve: Latin America, Europe and the Mediterranean region and Asia. And pricing is also improving in those regions. So we feel good about the export demand.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And this is my last question for John. Things have slowed a bit since -- even since the Analyst Day just globally. I'm just kind of wondering if this makes you think at all -- think any differently at all about growth CapEx moving forward, particularly in emerging markets where some of that slowing is occurring.","John V. Faraci","Well, most of our growth CapEx, Phil, is, just what I talked about, is currently underway. I mean, we're at the -- probably 80% done at the Sun JV, 70% done at Bratsk and somewhere -- probably 70% to 80% done at Kotlas. We need paper in Russia. The Russia paper market is growing at 5%. So we're sold out both at IP and at Ilim. So we need that capacity. The Sun joint venture is -- we're going to bring on a lot of capacity. We've done that before. We'll sell that over time, ramp up maybe a little slower than last time, but we're not worried about that. And the project in Brazil is really a cost reduction project. It's not aimed at more capacity. So we don't have a big agenda of a repeat of these growth projects right behind what's currently underway. So don't be thinking about that we're going to continue to be piling on these projects. We've got a number that are underway now that are either ramping up or going to ramp up. And in the fluff pulp area, we're basically sold out -- as we can get the fluff pulp qualified with customers, we're sold out because most of that product is going into the export markets where fluff pulp is growing at a faster rate than it is in North America.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just to be clear, I was talking kind of more of the 2013 to 2015 that you talked about in the Analyst Day, but I'll turn it over.","John V. Faraci","Yes, we still see. Remember, there's not a lot of growth CapEx going in there, but there's more CapEx in that 2013 to '15 period because of Boiler MACT.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman of UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","To follow up on the pension comments, are you just not looking at the change from the highway bill as a reduction in debt at all and you're still sticking to the $3 billion, 24-month target, but it's just going to be weighted more towards fixed, actual debt versus pension?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, Gail. Yes. Clearly, the highway bill, it only changes the funding requirements. It doesn't change the accounting. So we recognized that. But rather than putting the money into the pension plan, we'll just push it towards the balance sheet debt. And that's a little bit of a shift of what we had talked about. But we still have our target of getting to 3x, so debt repayment is our goal, and -- but we'll move it towards the balance sheet debt versus the pension.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the price trajectory during the second quarter? There were a lot of movements. I guess a couple of specific questions. You referenced some improvement on coated freesheet. Can you talk a little more specifically about what you saw? And in terms of the export containerboard price increase, initially, you were expecting that to be a little bit weighted towards the end of the second quarter, and I'm just wondering what that would imply for third quarter pricing.","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, Gail, I'll give you a generic answer because I know in the Appendix, we provide the information by the segments. And so I'm not going to paw through the pages. But I think in the paper segment, I think we saw a $17 improvement in paper prices. We saw a pulp improvement. We don't specifically call out containerboard in the Appendix. We do actually do boxes there. But, Mark, I don't know if you want to comment about containerboard.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Sure. Gail, on containerboard on the export market, we saw an exit rate from the second quarter that was about $40 a ton higher than what we exited the first quarter.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one last one. Can you give any update on the status of the marketing of the building products business?","John V. Faraci","We're going to be going out in the market with offering the building products business very shortly. And at this point, it's too soon to say what's going -- what the response is going to be, but we've had a lot of interest. So that'll be in the market in the third quarter and very shortly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Question on the Wood Products business. And I just want a quick one, is when you look at the discontinued operations' results, it looks like it did quite well. Can you just give us an idea of kind of how it did in the second quarter?","John V. Faraci","It did a lot better than we thought it was going to do, and we put it in discontinued operations.","Carol L. Roberts","Yes, Chip, this is Carol. John Balboni, who is heading up the overall integration for Temple-Inland from the corporate side and system side and also looking after building products, it was a positive quarter, and he would categorize it as all 3 segments were a bit better, demand was better, pricing was better and we ran well. And there's a very good team over there that's been running that business well. It's a Temple-Inland team. They're onboard. They're aligned, engaged. So it's been a positive outcome for us. [indiscernible]...","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And can we infer that EBIT was around $25 million?","John V. Faraci","Yes, the EBITDA is -- I think the run rate in the second quarter is about $80 million, in that range. And if we can be doing that in a 700,000s housing start environment, that business is very well positioned for an improving housing environment over the next several years.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And then looking back at the -- your target adjusted debt ratio, maybe I missed this in the past, but you've added this $1.2 billion operating lease adjustment. Is that something you've had for a long time? And I guess more importantly, you're down to 3.7x, and we would expect with the sale of the Wood Products business, that would push that down lower. But we wouldn't expect you to be below 3 until, I guess, well into next year would be my guess, depending on how fast EBITDA comes up. Are you going to wait until you get to 3x before you would consider a dividend increase or a buyback?","Carol L. Roberts","Chip, let me answer the first part. That operating lease adjustment has always been there. The metric we use for this is we generally use the Moody's metric. So this is just the Moody's methodology, so it's always there. And yes, the goal is 3, and if you do the math, it's going to take into next year, and it's going to take a little bit of time to do that. The good news is, we're generating strong cash. We sold the mills, we've got the building products. Relative to timing, as we said at Investor Day, we don't view these things as sequential. We view them as in parallel, and we'll continue to look at our cash and capital allocation strategy and keep everything in front of us at all times. I don't know, John, if you want to add anything else.","John V. Faraci","You said it very well.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","So in other words, you don't have to get to that level, but if you're moving close to it, it might give you -- you'll feel the flexibility to do what I mentioned, either a dividend increase or a buyback?","Carol L. Roberts","It's all around your trajectory and the outlook and where you're going. And given the positive trends we see in some of the businesses, as well as the levers we have, we feel good about our cash flow generation potential going forward.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then quickly on the Boiler MACT, I know you, and I believe you're the only major company in the industry that actually included it in your projections of CapEx in future years, but we're still, I guess, a ways from when you actually have to commit to those funds. Or should I read something differently? Is it something you're going to do no matter what? Or do you think as regulations could evolve into next year, there could be some change in that guidance?","John V. Faraci","We pretty much have our arms around what it's going to be. EPA hasn't come out with the final regulations. They probably won't until after the election. But at this point in time, I think based on the conversations we've had with EPA and the association has had, we can put a pretty close set of parameters around the capital we're going to spend. And the time frame is really going to be 3 to 4 years, depending upon the states, for when the regulations get issued. So it may get pushed out a couple of months, but we know what we're going to need to do. And when those regulations come out, we'll start to do it.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. And last quick question. In Latin -- in Brazil, where you have an option, I believe, to build another uncoated machine down there, I believe that option is stated to have to be exercised by year-end. But given you're probably the only option for the other party, is there a chance you might be able to push that out? Or are there any further thoughts you can give us about the possibility of that next machine?","John V. Faraci","Well, I would just say this, Chip, it's premature to kind of speculate on what we're going to do there, but we've got a very good relationship with Fibria. They're running the pulp mill. We've got the paper mill right next door. And so we're having an ongoing dialogue with them about their future plans and our future plans. And I think we're looking -- whatever we do will be in the best interest of both parties.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Carol, just a couple of questions for you to start off. Can you just help us think about the delta at Franklin going from the second quarter to the third quarter? And then can you also just clarify what you mean with that sort of greenlight signal on Ilim and FX going from the second quarter to the third quarter?","Carol L. Roberts","Yes. And I know Glenn can follow up with some more of the specifics, but think about Franklin as a cost in the second quarter with no revenue, and then think about Franklin now running and producing revenue. So it's this nice, positive swing, and I think I'm getting the signal that it's okay to talk about it in the $0.03 range from second to third.","John V. Faraci","Yes, there's a cumulative impact there, Mark. If you look at their ramp curve, we're not going to be making much fluff pulp in the third quarter, so we've got to qualify it with customers. So you'll start to see Franklin really swing as we move into the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year.","Carol L. Roberts","Relative to Ilim, Ilim is just assuming that the ruble stays where it is. We just don't have to pay for the marking, the debt to market again. So that just goes away. We don't have the hit.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. Got that. Another question, John, for either you or for Mark Sutton. I'm just kind of curious with this containerboard hike out in the market. Why is it that you wouldn't just announce the box hike at the same time? At the end of the day, you sell more boxes than containerboard and at the -- or you sell mostly boxes. If the containerboard hike is going in place, aren't the boxes going up anyway?","John V. Faraci","Well, we announced, I think, the containerboard price increase late last week and the box price increase earlier this week. So it wasn't -- I'll let Mark comment on that, but I wouldn't say there was much time between the 2 of them. We wanted to make sure we had a good plan to let customers know what was going on.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Yes, I think that's right, John. And Mark, the real concern is properly communicating to our customers in an appropriate way, whether it's on the board side or on the box side. And as John said, we're only talking a few days' difference here.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I wasn't aware you had the box hike out there in the market. And then finally, John, can we just talk a little bit about sort of acquisitions? We've talked about the potential for further -- the likelihood of further debt reduction, as well as buybacks and dividends, but I know that you have been continuing to look at growth opportunities offshore. I'm just curious, with these emerging markets slowing down now, whether that prospectively creates a little better environment for you in looking at where you want to grow long term?","John V. Faraci","Well, first of all, Mark, we don't [indiscernible] on acquisitions or investments or portfolio realignments. And we're in the business for the long term, committed to a balanced use of cash, which we talked about at Investor Day. So I don't think -- I don't want investors to think that we're on an acquisition -- on the acquisition hunt. We're not. We've still got very clear metrics about what we -- the criteria for making acquisitions. We have made some, and we've stuck to that criteria. And then if we don't find anything that meets our criteria, we won't do anything. But we're committed to a balanced use of cash, which means cash back to shareowners, debt repayment, a strong balance sheet. And selectively and carefully, where we think there's an opportunity and a good value to do something that improves International Paper, improves our businesses, we'll do it. We'll look at it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And first of all, congratulations, really is a lot of visibility on bringing those Temple-Inland synergies to the bottom line, and that's very impressive. Couple of clarification questions. One, on the box price, can you give us what the specifics are? Start there.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Sure, Mark. We informed our customers of a 8% increase on boxes and a 10% increase on sheets, effective September 1.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And second, and I apologize, I know you were saying something about $80 million on the building products, is that what the -- was that the EBIT or the EBITDA run rate? And what is the EBITDA run rate of building products in the second quarter?","John V. Faraci","That's EBITDA run rate, Mark.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. That was EBITDA. And then lastly, you had mentioned that you are $40 higher on the containerboard export exiting 2Q versus 1Q. Can you tell us what the difference was exiting the quarter versus the average for the second quarter?","Mark Stephan Sutton","I think for the quarter, the second quarter, the average price second quarter to first quarter was up about $15.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. So you're -- I'm sorry. So how much higher exiting the second quarter were you than the average for the second quarter? Do you know?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Let me let Glenn follow up with that. What I have on the top of my head is the exit-to-exit price. What I don't remember is what the average was in the first quarter. But we can get you that.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And actually, if I could just...","Carol L. Roberts","Mark, this is Carol. There's no doubt that the export price recovery is a very positive. The only headwind we have there is, when you're looking at price, we have to also consider the exchange rate and how that exchange rate might move through the quarter. And, of course, that does influence the pricing on a dollar basis a little bit.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Understood. And then actually, lastly, John, you had mentioned in your remarks that you thought that OCC and gas would neutralize each other, yet on the slide, it was green when you have the lower fiber versus higher energy. Is that because of wood being down? Or can you just clarify that?","John V. Faraci","I think what I was referring to was expectations for the third quarter. The slide was showing the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to go back to Temple-Inland a little bit in terms of the progress you've seen, and congratulations with the efforts thus far. When you think about what's gone better than expected, you mentioned getting the supply chain teams together more quickly, which, in turn, enabled maybe a bit more quicker reduction in overhead. Are there any other things that have gone a bit better than expected relative to what you were talking to and seeing at the Analyst Day?","Mark Stephan Sutton","George, I think the number one thing I would highlight, and I mentioned it at Analyst Day, but we just know so much more about it now, is the talent level that we have with the new Temple team members and their ability to get aligned with what is a different business model than they were used to. And that has led us to, for example, operational improvements at a much faster rate than we thought. I can think of waste improvement in our box system, for example, freight optimization, and then the streamlining of the operations, whether it was plant rationalizations and moving the business, because, of course, when we rationalize a plant, the goal is to keep 95% of the revenue and the customers. And that's a tough -- a tall order to do and do it quickly, and then also changing the scheduling concept of some of the larger plants so that we optimize what customers those plants serve. That takes a lot of people alignment, and I think that people alignment has gone better and faster than we probably anticipated.","John V. Faraci","George, I was at a Temple, a state where there were Temple and IP box plants, and now they're all IP box plants, the first week. And the plant managers were already talking 3 days into it about how they were going to move business around after they inform the customers, to take the logistics costs out. And remember, this is something I don't think people appreciate. Our logistics costs are higher than our labor costs in the box business. So we have huge opportunities on logistics that weren't available to us because we have a new system, and we've gotten after those very, very quickly. And the waste reduction that Mark Sutton referred to has just been really remarkable. The -- just getting those metrics out in front of people, and they've jumped on that really quickly.","Carol L. Roberts","And, Mark, one more -- or George, one more thing. Mark is being a little modest, too. I mean, the leadership that's been provided has been great, but the depths of the bench at International Paper, we didn't get a lot of the senior talent from Temple-Inland, but the people down in the facilities are very aligned. But we were able to come in with the team that we had and are running it and absorbed it very quickly.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the waste issue, was it a function that people just didn't have the data in front of them, or it was not necessarily the focus of the prior organization? I know it's maybe not the fairest thing to talk about on a conference call, but I nonetheless want to pose question.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Yes, it's a fair question because -- I think it was in 2 areas. One, it wasn't a tremendously high focus, but also, the way that the business was run before had higher structural waste. So part of it is improving the way the business is run. And the principle there is what we talked about in our strategy, and that is, we believe a box business can be profitable and that each plant should have a P&L focus. And then you have to put, as John said, the metrics in front of people to see all the sources of waste in the box plant, and they are many, and then put systems in place, which we already have and are easy to roll out, and educate people. And then it make sense when you look at the data, and people get on board pretty quickly. So that's really the 2 issues: focus and structurally running the business a bit differently.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I appreciate the comments. I have one last one on Temple and then one for Tom Kadien, if he's there. It sounds like you're pleased with your share retention. So it sounds like you're over your 95% goal. I wanted confirmation on that. And do you think perhaps you are, because of the capability, as you were in the first quarter, perhaps gaining share from some of the other folks within the market? And then on the Foodservice side, you're not the only company that's been talking about, across all the packaging, better Foodservice trends. Do you think it's purely related to the new product offering? Or are you seeing some sort of secular trend either towards away from home, replacement of at-home food preparation? Or is it just the fact that we had a hot first 6 months and people are drinking more soft drinks and that sort of thing?","Mark Stephan Sutton","George, I'll take the first one. And Tom Kadien is here, and I'll hand the Foodservice question off to him. On share, we're pretty much tracking very close to the market, so I wouldn't say we're gaining share. We're working very hard to keep the customers that we have. And obviously, the box business, there's customers moving and business moving on a continuous basis. So my comments about keeping 95% were specifically about rationalizing plants and consolidating business and changing schedules of plants. But we're largely tracking the market. And at a macro level, not quarter-to-quarter, but over a longer period of time, that's sort of our strategy, to grow with the market. And the question is, what customers and segments do we pick that might give us an advantage in a market? And that's the approach we take. And with that, I guess I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Yes, George, our Foodservice growth is really a result of the innovation and the new products that we're bringing to market and being aligned with the right customers. I think our volume was up 4% in the quarter. That's significantly better than, I'll say, the overall market is doing. And I think our customers are fighting food inflation and -- as it kind of rolls through their menu. And they're putting a lot of emphasis on beverages as a place to make money and to innovate, and that fits very well with our strategy around the new products.","Operator","Your next question comes from Al Kabili of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked, but I guess maybe one for Tim on the uncoated free sheet. Volumes, North America, you continue to outperform the industry. And I was just wondering, how sustainable do you think that is? And what's driving that?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Al, well, I think what we're doing is sustainable. And the way we look at it, we have a North American customer base that we service, and we also have export markets that we service. So our feeling is that through the first quarter and second quarter, we see the market as being stable and our mix in the market being stable over the next couple of quarters.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And was exports -- I mean, can you help us with what exports -- how much that helped the volume number there?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Well, they were down in the quarter because we had a heavy outage quarter, and so we didn't ship as much and export in the second quarter as we did in the first. But we're doing a couple of things. We're anticipating the capacity that was asked about in Brazil earlier in the call, and we're working between our Brazilian business and our North American business to look at markets and baseload volumes. We're also backfilling some of the product that Brazil has been shipping into Europe as Brazil pulls back and grows in region.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And if I could just switch to the other, just a quick question on the containerboard, if we could switch to that. Can you just help us with -- give us some parameters on the negative mix impact sequentially, how we should be thinking about it, maybe some more color there, if there's any kind of quantification you could also give us in terms of dollars per ton or something headwind there?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Sure, Al. The mix comment and what shows on the outlook heat-map chart is really designed to focus on the change in our agricultural business from the second quarter to the third quarter. We're a lot bigger in that now post the Temple merger. So it's in the neighborhood of $1 a ton on boxes. So that's really what that comment is focused on.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. I appreciate that. And then final question, while we're on the topic of agricultural, do you see -- well, how do you see the risk of the Midwest drought to your volumes on the ag side? Are you getting any early indications there?","Mark Stephan Sutton","I think most of the ag that I'm referring to tends to be on the coasts, the fresh produce. And if you look at what's going on in the Midwest drought, I think our biggest potential impact is really the knock-on effect of cost. Some of our customers are seeing their cost rise for feed, corn, feed for their animals. That means they may have to deal with that and could affect their demand. And then our own input materials like starch and others that are related to -- primarily corn is where we see a potential impact from the Midwest drought.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Kurt Schoen - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","This is Kurt Schoen filling in for Mark. Can you give us some more color on how the Indian business has performed recently and relative to initial expectations?","John V. Faraci","Did you say it was a question about India?","Kurt Schoen - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Yes, India. [indiscernible]","John V. Faraci","He just got back.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Yes. Kurt, I would say India is just like we thought it was going to be. The Q2 was all about, frankly, for them, a very large outage. It was our first experience doing a very large outage in India, and that really impacted April and May. But we saw a very good June come out of India and demand. While we're talking about it slowing in terms of uncoated free sheet, as John said, we can sell everything we can make, and we're looking at double digit year-over-year increases in uncoated free sheet there. So it's, as I think I said at Investor Day, it's everything we thought it would be. It's got a lot of upside potential, and it's hard. So I'd say we're right where we thought we would be in India.","John V. Faraci","Tom, do you want to comment about pulp mill running, coming out of the outage?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Yes. We had a significant pulp mill outage, and our hardwood pulp is up over 10%, which is a real advantage for us in that marketplace. And now that we've got, frankly, at this point, a little bit excess mark -- or excuse me, excess hardwood pulp, now we can put the pressure on getting the paper machine productivity up. So we think we're going to continue to grow, and we've got a nice integrated mill over there in Rajahmundry that's got a lot of upside.","John V. Faraci","If we look at it in terms of people, assets and markets, we're pretty pleased with what we see.","Kurt Schoen - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then has the weak monsoon affected demand there? Or do you expect it to?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Boy, I'm aware of the weak monsoon season. I think kind of like what Mark Sutton just said, it's probably going to impact food prices. That may have a knock-on impact, but I don't think it's going to hit our uncoated free sheet business.","Kurt Schoen - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then going to the Sun JV, can you give us some more color on how that's managed the downturn thus far? And given the downturn, do you think you guys can expect to see any more opportunities to expand your footprint in China?","Thomas Gustave Kadien","Well, on the Sun JV, we're a largely nonintegrated producer, so we follow pulp pricing. It's been fairly volatile. If you look at the page in the deck, you can see pulp prices have come down on the input side for Sun, and pricing has come down accordingly. So it's all about managing margins over there. We're sold out. We're still solidly profitable and looking forward to having more capacity to sell, starting up late in September and putting product out into the market probably in October. So our Sun JV is running very well. It's all about execution in the kind of market they're in right now, and they run just a great operation over there. And I think it's a volatile market right now, but as long as we're managing our margins, we're going to be fine. I'm not going to speculate on further expansions into China. Our box business over there, we're starting to get traction, and we have a lot of capacity in our box business that's not full. So we have a lot of growth in China without putting in more expansion or acquisitions.","John V. Faraci","Kurt, and one of the things that we talked about in the outlook page, that heat map, or I didn't talk about it, but it's on there, is we are going to incur the startup costs for the Sun paper machine this quarter. We won't have a repeat of the Franklin costs, but we're going to have some startup expenses out of Sun.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","To move back to Consumer Packaging, I was wondering if there was any noticeable trend, either positive or negative, on how demand moved through the 3 months of the quarter and into July. And then on your outlook slide, you reference packaging, volume and pricing to be basically stable in the third quarter. I was wondering, if you were to kind of split that out into industrial and consumer, would consumer be kind of a little bit weaker or in line or stronger than industrial? Any color you can give would be helpful.","Thomas Gustave Kadien","I'll handle the consumer side. I would say, we saw some sequential growth second quarter better than first, but it was really the -- the slope of the line was better right up until Investor Day, and then it just kind of moved sideways. So the back half of May and June was really moving sideways. We'll see some sequential improvement in the third quarter again, but I wouldn't call it a recovery. I think we're kind of moving sideways, and seasonality is going to improve. Pricing, I would say, is stable at this point in consumer packaging.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And on the containerboard side, it seems like the biggest chunk of synergies that have yet to be realized involve the mills. And I was wondering, as we look out to the work at the mills, is there significant downtime or heavy engineering work that might bring some operational risk or some work that's maybe nonroutine? Or how should we think about that over the next year, 1.5 years?","Mark Stephan Sutton","Anthony, the mill synergies, as we discussed at Investor Day, some of the work we've identified does require mill outages, and based on when we closed the deal, we missed the window for some of that. So that's why some of those synergies are later in the time period. But we're not looking at anything unique or things that we haven't done before. There's a lot of projects, some capital, some just operational changes that have to do with energy reduction and consumption reduction, better choices on how we provide fiber to the mills, whether it's virgin fiber or recycled fiber. And in some cases, it's just operational changes that we're able to make while we're running to improve quality and cost. So there's nothing out there that we've discovered in our GAAP analysis that is unique or things that we haven't done before.","John V. Faraci","I think the really important point to understand is, those mill synergies aren't CapEx-driven. There are things we will do when we have a regularly planned outage, and we spend an incredible amount of time planning outages in International Paper because we spend over $400 million a year on them. And we usually execute flawlessly. That's the standard we expect.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Chercover of D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of quickies on freesheet and containerboard. First of all, Carol, I think you said that domestic containerboard prices were stable. Can you talk a little bit about how box prices have eroded over the last year or so?","Carol L. Roberts","Well, I think our chart shows that there's about a $7 erosion through the full year. And there's the -- also is a little bit of mix in there, so it's kind of hard to look at that. So that's why we would categorize boxes as relatively stable.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Got it. And you did indicate how they're going to change on September 1. How do you feel about your inventories presently and, I guess, going forward?","Carol L. Roberts","And I will let Mark answer those questions relative to the business.","Mark Stephan Sutton","Yes, we like our inventory levels right now based on learning how to operate our new system. They're at good absolute level and under control. And as I mentioned in an earlier answer, as we look at the third quarter and where our orders are materializing, given most of our big outages are behind us, we are prepared to run the capacity that we need to serve those orders and don't see any reason to build any inventory whatsoever.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Perfect. The only red square on I think what was referred to as the color chart or the heat chart is the mill divestiture impact. What did those 3 mills contribute in Q2? Was it maybe $20 million or so in EBITDA?","Mark Stephan Sutton","John mentioned, I think, or Carol did, closer to $30 million in Q2. So we're just calling that out as an -- those earnings go away for the third quarter.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And the final question is on uncoated freesheets, I guess, for Tim. The June statistics were fairly weak, down 7.1%, although I recognize you guys are outperforming. Is that an indication of escalating demand erosion? Or were customers giving the highs [ph] into the price hikes?","Timothy S. Nicholls","Well, I don't want to speculate on price. But what I would say about the demand is, and I think if you go back to a number of the months, at least 2 or 3 of them in -- so far in the first half of this year, some of the months can be a little bit deceptive. There were things that were going on last year. And what we're -- we look at each month, but we're continuing to pay attention to year-to-date numbers. And those numbers look right in line with what we had expected in terms of demand decline. So I saw the June numbers. Yes, it's a big decrease, but when you look at it overall, I think it's pretty much in line. We'll have to see how it plays out over the third quarter.","Operator","And our final question is coming from Paul Quinn of RBC Capital.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the sale of the Temple building materials division. Is that -- the structure of that sale, is there going to be -- or are you thinking of it as 1 unit or a collection of assets?","John V. Faraci","Paul, it's 1 business. It's operating 1 business. We're going to put it out in the market as 1 business, and there are some bidders that may be -- some parties may be interested more in lumber or gypsum panels. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. We've got really good options to try to realize the highest value, but our preference is to sell it as 1 business. But obviously, we're going to be driven by where the value is. And the businesses are set up where they can be if we end up there, selling them as a gypsum business, a lumber business, a panel business.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And what do you expect on the timing of the sale? Is that by the end of the year?","John V. Faraci","It depends on how it gets sold, if we're going to be out. The -- we're already starting. We'll be out next week with the information to prospective buyers. And so we'll move as quickly as we can, but our objective will be to maximize the value.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Glenn Landau for any closing remarks.","Glenn Landau","Yes. So this just brings our second quarter earnings conference call to a close. We certainly appreciate everybody's participation this morning. Of course, I, along with our media contact, Tom Ryan, will be available today, and as always, for follow-up questions at the numbers listed in the Appendix. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
